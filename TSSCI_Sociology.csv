What Does 'Langue' Mean from Saussure's Perspective?,Yu-Chai Lai,"Langue, relations, prototype, Saussure, langue, system","In the field of communication, the importance of the concept of langue, which was brought into attention by Saussure's seminal work on language, cannot be too much exaggerated,. But Saussure did not give a clear definition of langue. Based on my reading of Saussure, Ⅰ find that the concept 'langue' has two meanings. ""Langue' may be seen as a 'system', in which its components, signs, are interdependent of each other. 'Langue' also refers to the rules governing language, such as the rule of combination. To sum up, langue is a network in which signs are linked to each other in various forms such as association, differentiation and combination.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=149,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
"""Wombat"", Who Are You? Enlightenment from Saussure's Semiology and His Limitation",Pei Tsai,"Saussure, semiology, structure, parole, meaning, value","The present paper attempts to examine how Saussure finds meaning in the linguistic structure and at the same time to point out to the limitation of the Saussrean conception of language, which, in my opinion, is restricted to a relatively static view of meaning. Saussure argues that meaning rests on the value of signs, which in turn derives from the interactions among difference, negation, syntagm and association. Saussure fails to pay adequate attention to the interactions among object, person and sign and therefore the influence of context.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=150,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
"Escape from Saussure's System: The Combination, Separation, and Recombination of the Signifier and the Signified",Yu-Chung Cheng,"Saussure, sign, signifier, signified, meaning, signification","This article begins with an overview of the premises of the Saussurean linguistics, which postulates that signification rests upon the association between the signifier and the signified. However, this article proceeds to argue that Saussure fails to account for recent linguistic phenomena such as the hybrid language which characterizes communication in the internet. Moreover, Saussure may not have foreseen the tendency to employ language for enjoyment in addition to signification. The rise of the hybrid language points out to the possibility that language could serve both the purpose of enjoyment and signification through the combination, separation and recombination of the signifier and the signified.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=151,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
How the Concept of Arbitrariness Informs the Study of Meaning?,Ya-Hui Chen,"arbitrariness, identity, name-changing, movement, Nomenclature, Saussure, value","Starting from the concept of arbitrariness as postulated by Saussure, this article will examine how the concept of arbitrariness leads to the departure from the previous linguistic theories and to the rise of new thinking in linguistics. In contrast to the pre-Saussurean linguistics, the concept of arbitrariness argues that sign does not correspond to reality, and as a corollary, that the signifier has no natural connection with the signified. In addition, the concept of arbitrariness points out to the constraints in the process of signification. To illustrate, this article applies Saussure's linguistics to examine the mechanism of the name-changing campaign in Taiwan.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=152,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
The Galaxy of Linguistics: The Transformation of Associative Relations,Shu-Fen Yang,"Saussure, associative relations, sign, linguistic structure, communication, cyber words","Linguistic structure, as the core component of languages, is the outcome of individual mind as well as social convention. To be specific, linguistic structure, with the faculty of association and coordination, performs the signification and communication. This study is to examine the transformation of linguistic structure out of the associative relationships in ideographs, alphabetical languages and cyber words. It is suggested that the cyber words characterized by a metamorphosis of various languages, have resulted in a proliferation of forms of associations, which increases complexity in communication.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=153,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

"A Historical Review of the TV Drama Programs in Taiwan's Three Wireless TV Companies, 1962-2002",Yean Tsai,"television, drama, history","The purpose of this research is to review how the three wireless TV companies in Taiwan programmed their drama series in the past 40 years. Three major questions are raised, including what early programming strategies and methods were, how important works and experiences were involved, and how the public opinion aimed at these programs. In-depth interview and historical research methods are employed to investigate the development of TV drama programs. Important staffs, events and TV drama series are documented. In general, the content of the TV drama programs is found to be unsatisfactory by the public opinion over the past 40 years. The research then concludes that the lack of cultural and political supports should be the main factor, and building a strong artistic environment for the TV drama programs is desperately needed.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=156,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Who Gains Access to the Media? A Study of Contribution to Opinion Page in Terms of Cultural Capital,Tzong-Sheng Deng,"access to media, social responsibility, culture capital, public sphere","The present study aims to examine who gains access to opinion page in the newspaper in terms of Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital. This study found that elites, compared to the ordinary people, are more likely to gain more access to the opinion page. In addition, the newspaper tends to highlight the title and profession of contributors, which articulate status and power, whereby symbolic violence may find its way into opinion page and may furthermore reduce the public's incentive to access the media. As a public good the media should strive to insure public access to the media. The public should be aware of the fact that the media is part of the public sphere and take an active role to access the media.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=19&CA_ID=157,6,2004,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The Third Person Effect of Slimming Advertisement,"Mei-Ya Lin, Chien-Yi Chiang, Wei-Hung Tsai","body image, involvement, the third person effect, slimming advertisement, social distance, social pressure","Previous researches of slimming advertising are mainly focused on the construction of female body images and myths. This research focuses instead on the examination of slimming advertising. This research concludes that the third person effect is suitable for the research of slimming advertising. ""The social distance hypothesis"" proposed in this research is not supported by the evidence shown in the survey result. The result shows that not only men are more likely to think that slimming advertisement has produced greater effects on their female counterparts, but women are also having the same thoughts, even more so. This research has made an interesting finding by pointing out that the degree of involvement in certain conditions may lead to ""reversed third person effect"".",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=18&CA_ID=148,7,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
The Commodification of TV Program Production Process in Taiwan,Shih-Chen Chang,"outsourcing, political economy, commodification, independent production house","The emergence of the TV industry in Taiwan is more than 40 years, but people here could hardly enjoy good TV programs. This article aims to explain Taiwan's TV production phenomena from the perspective of critical political economy of communication. This paper argues that none of the three major TV stations produced sufficient programs itself when they monopolized TV broadcasting in Taiwan. Instead, production tasks were outsourcing to many small independent production houses. And this is one of the reasons why the quality of Taiwan's TV programs was poor. After cable TV entered the market, there existed too many competing channels struggling for limited resources. In this period, advertisers unified and used TV ratings in media buying. This made many TV programs more like advertisements. In conclusion, the problems of Taiwan's TV industry were related to the historical context and certain structural factors that have to be placed in a wider capitalist system to understand its dynamics.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=18&CA_ID=146,7,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Media Discourse of Polling and Its Construction of Public Opinion: From a Perspective of Critical Linguistics,Yie-Jing Yang,"public opinion, polling, public, discourse analysis, opinion construction","Public opinion polling has become the best space for representing people's opinions. The media discourse of polling reports reflects questions regarding media representation and construction of reality. That is to say, how media (or politicians) use publicity and discourse to construct ""public"" opinion and ""reality"" is really worth discussing. Therefore, this paper adopts a critical linguistics approach to analyze the meaning of discourse in public opinion polling reports. The results of this paper conclude three types of polling discourse formats: 1. using majority/minority discourse to construct generalized or polarized opinions, 2. using hegemony and articulation discourse to construct ""main stream"" opinions, 3. using percentage and causality discourse to construct ""real"" and ""objective"" opinions.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=18&CA_ID=147,7,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Multicultural Public Service Broadcaster: An Australian Experience,Vivien Wang,"Australian multiculturalism, ethnic group, public service broadcaster, indigenous people","The creation of the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) was closely related to Australia's population policy. Through its operation and practices, the SBS has been working to define, fertilise and enrich the notion of 'multiculturalism'. Initially, the SBS aimed to represent and voice the ethnic groups. Now, it has become the bridge to a wider, different world, which has not been well provided by other electronic media in Australia. All Australians can have access to the service of SBS. This paper looks at the development of SBS. It focuses on the SBS's innovative practice for niche establishment and for its becoming the strategic site of Australian independent filmmaking. This paper aims to show that the changing notion of 'multiculturalism' may create challenges for the broadcaster to fulfill its Charter responsibilities.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=18&CA_ID=145,7,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
A Study of Product Information Suspiciously Embedded in Television Trendy Drama,"Chen-Hsing Hsu, Jhen-Yu Huang","product information, product placement, television trendy drama","Although ""product placement"" has been widely utilized by the marketing practitioners, only few researches in Taiwan studied the utilization of this marketing tool and its communication effects. Therefore, by analyzing the content of television trendy drama and in-depth interviewing the marketing and media practitioners, this study intends to investigate how ""product placement"" was used to promote the product. The results of this study indicate that the products placed in TV trendy drama were mostly fashion merchandizes for teenagers. These products were visually rather than audibly shown in TV trendy drama. Moreover, male teenagers who were the major actors in the trendy drama were frequently employed to convey product information.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=17&CA_ID=133,8,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
An Exploratory Study on the Application of Product Placement in Tobacco Control,Yu-Li Wang,"idea marketing, product placement, tobacco control, health communication","One hot issue that has been intensively debated in Taiwan is the utilization of ""product placement"" in media contents. The advertising and marketing practitioners have employed ""product placement"" to promote products or merchandises. Product information has been embedded in media contents in order to increase brand awareness, influence the consumer's attitude positively toward the product, and stimulate the willingness for the consumer to purchase the products. While consuming media contents, the audience is also unconsciously exposed to commercial information. The objectives of this study were first to explore the utilization of product placement in promoting the concept of tobacco control. Secondly, to provide guidelines for better use of product placement in government tobacco control. To achieve these objectives, this study employed the qualitative analysis of the product placement cases in tobacco control, the methods of the focus group interview, and in-depth interviews.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=17&CA_ID=134,8,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
"Crisis of the Utilization of ""Product Placement"" in News: The Exploration of the Public Interest of News Media in Taiwan",Huei-Ling Liu,"product placement, public interest, publicness, ethic of journalism","When Taiwanese government introduced ""product placement"", to promote their policies in news reporting since 2002, it became a highly debatable issue. This article explores the concept of the ""public interest"" by first referring to the conflict of public interest and product placement. Amid the complex environment of conflicting interests, this article attempts to propose a framework for the public and the media to participate in creating the public interest. Meanwhile, this article stresses two points: (1) ""Public interest"" should be based on public, rational and plural communication, any attempt to ""place"" private interest in news will violate the value of public interest. (2) News reporting for ""public interest"" should be based on professional values: independency, autonomy and responsibility. The placed news functions to manipulate journalist profession. Without being able to do independent and autonomous news reports, how can we expect the news to fulfill public interests? Any media organizations that accept ""product placement"" would gain profit but lose credibility in return.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=17&CA_ID=136,8,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Exploring Advertorials in Television News: Product Placement vs. Professionalism of News Reporting,Ping-Hung Chen,"advertising influence on news content, advertorial, news professionalism, product placement, television news","In recent years, external economic influences from advertising agencies, rather than political influences from government or political parties, on media content have produced greater effects than before. Thus, adding alternative perspectives to the study on influences on news content, this research focuses on economic power in general and advertising in particular, instead of political power, on media like before. This study employs two research methods, questionnaire survey and focus group discussion, to collect required data for analysis. Questionnaire survey of journalists of television stations is conducted to discover current reality of advertising influences on news content production. Meanwhile, focus group discussion is organized to explore negative influences of advertorials on professionalism and autonomy of media, and if possible, to propose suggestions of regulations. Overall, this study concludes that advertorials appeared in television news are getting popular and acceptable in Taiwan among television news reporters. Even though advertorials are against professionalism of news reporting, more than half of television reporters surveyed are voluntarily willing to produce advertorials under major consideration of financial pressure on their media.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=17&CA_ID=137,8,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
"Revisiting the Concept of ""News"": The Modernity and Postmodernity of Linguistic Studies in Taiwan's Journalism History",Hsiao-Yung Wang,"critically oriented linguistics, postmodernity, modernity, structuralist linguistics, journalism history","This paper aims to explore the meaning of linguistic studies in Taiwan's Journalism history by revisiting the concept of ""news"". Starting with a critique of Lin's conceptual framework and attribution, this paper highlights the oversight of complexity of linguistic studies. Drawing on modernity and postmodernity, two types of linguistic studies are specified: structuralism-oriented approach vs. critically oriented approach (post structural and systemic-functional). The former can be attributed to modernism, the latter unfolds postmodernity in respect of the philosophy of subjectivity, epistemology and the nature of knowledge. In addition, this paper addresses that linguistic studies not only challenge the assumptions of positivism but inherit the emancipatory interest of critical theory and inspire the postmodern thinking to treat news as ""discourse"".",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=17&CA_ID=138,8,2005,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Capital Formation in Taiwan's Television under the Authoritarian Rule,Lih-Yun Lin,"authoritarian rule, television history, capital formation","Of the central concern of this paper is the capital formation in Taiwan's television in the 1960s. It asks: how were the opposite elements of the capital contradicted, negotiated and finally united? This paper answers the problem by looking into the logic of the state under the authoritarian rule. According to the analysis, the party-state mainly conceived television as a governmental propaganda tool, not as a cultural and educational institution, thus declining to invest, and allowing state bureaucrats and private capitals to make extortionate profits. But developed in different contexts, the capital formation of the three stations had slight differences. The official and private shareholders had contradictions and even conflicts, but driven by common interests, they became united. Based on the analysis, this paper suggests that as the private shareholders have long garnered interests, their shares be returned to the public at low cost.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=16&CA_ID=123,9,2006,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The answer for cyberfeminists is ""yes"" but we have a doubt on it. Through interviewing 14 experienced players, this study attempts to illustrate that the online game, being an important and popular area of cyberspace, could not liberate the female. The results of the study indicate that the communicative characters of online game, including the entertaining tendency, male-center and re-embodiment, would not help females conquer the existing dualistic gender identity model.

The paper begins with a review of literature, and the review raises several issues for further research in this area. Responding to the issues, the analysis of headlines collected and the calculations of recurrences show that: (1) Mandarin expressions borrowed from English pronunciations are more than English words and phrases, (2) there has been an increase of code mixings in the corpus since the 1990's, (3) noun phrases are the major syntactic category where code-mixing takes place, and they have been noticeably amplifying since the 1990's.

Narrative Rejuvenating on Human and Social Science Writing,Shao-Chia Hu,"narrating subject, time of narration, social science writing, paradigmatic style","In the past, literature and science were usually divided to two separate domains. Literature was the repository of rhetoric, subjectivity, and fiction, whereas science was the repository of ""plain"" language, objectivity, and fact. The ""modernist"" vision of science writing, which was treated as a transparent, clear pane of glass, simply reflecting the objective ""reality"", has dominated social scientific thinking. Until recently, this view has been seriously challenged. The purpose of this article is to respond to such a challenge.

Originally, both government councils outsourced TV stations to produce programs for the two ethnic TV channels, and, each channel was managed jointly by the relevant council and outsourced TV stations. However, this kind of government interference was against the principle of political parties, the government and the military withdrawing their shares from the electronic media. Methods employed by this paper include literature review, in-depth interview, and primary document analysis.

New Zealand has transformed her state television enterprise into a pubic-service one. This paper mainly asks: to what extent has the transformation of TVNZ contributed to the promotion of her audio-visual industry? According to the analysis, among the three policy options, New Zealand only adopted a reform on a minimal scale, thus TVNZ, trapped in the contradictions of public service and business performance, can not fully support the industry. Based on the above analysis, we suggest that future media reform should cover the governance of private media and the financial structures of public service television, in order to develop a sustainable audio-visual industry.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=15&CA_ID=115,10,2006,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The major findings are: (1) In a hierarchical organization, middle-level employees or managers, rather than top executives or official speak persons, are most likely to be journalists' main sources. (2) Strong ties between reporters and sources can facilitate the information flow and help the former get inside news. (3) Reporters themselves can be ""bridges"", providing valuable information for their sources and hence enhancing their status. (4) Personal ties between reporters and their sources do not necessarily do harm to journalists' professional ethics, on the contrary, these linkages may be critical to freedom of press.

Past research tends to be plagued by an undue emphasis on Cartesian dichotomies such the division between mind and object, society and individual and is thus unable to offer feasible solutions to practical problems. To remedy this problem, this paper, drawing on our past research on expertise and relevant bodies of literature, contends that we need to make several epistemological turns before we plunge into empirical research. This paper is divided into two parts. The first part will elaborate on the three turns we have made in the investigation of digital craftsmanship. To be brief, we argue that the study of digital craftsmanship should turn to interaction with tool, embodied interaction and activity. Following on these turns, we proceed to characterize digital craftsmanship along three dimensions: materiality, affordance, craftsmanship.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=15&CA_ID=117,10,2006,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Thirty-three high school students participated in the experiment. Each student was asked to read four science news, two with metaphor and two without metaphor. The metaphor sentence was embedded at the very beginning of the text. Participants were asked to write down their free recalls of the article immediately after reading the four stories. The number of macro-propositions recalled and the accuracy of the situation model of the science text were used as the measures of text comprehension. The results support our hypotheses that: (1) applying metaphor enhances the comprehension of gist in a science report, and (2) applying metaphor in science reporting may help readers construct a more correct situation model of the scientific findings.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=14&CA_ID=105,11,2007,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This study, based on the survey of a convenience store's customers suggested that if concealment on the part of PR professionals is motivated by a concern for the interests of employees and employer, customers may be less likely to condemn concealment. The determinants of acceptance are, in ascending order of importance, are concern for the interests of employees, employer, and self. The study also found that commitment varies with concern for employees, employer and self. Mutual control and trust, however, are correlated with concern for the interest of other employees.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=14&CA_ID=108,11,2007,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The operation of this daily will be analyzed along the three following dimensions: the primary operation rules, the market mechanism, and the process of news production. The research methods employed are participant observation, documentary method, and in-depth interview. It is found that the traditional norms of journalism have been upheld in the Apple Daily, which serves to maintain the quality of news production.

On Understanding and Misunderstanding of Third-Person Effect,Dennis Weng-Jeng Peng,"first-person effect, second-person effect, third-person effect, third-person perception","Arguments of the third-person effect only provide partial and contingent explanations. Efforts seeking theories which can systematically explain the third-person effect across cognitional and behavioral levels are needed. Methodologically, any conclusions about whether ""order effect"" interferes with the third-person effect call for further examination. For example, predicting support for censorship by perceptual differences has its limitations. ""Impact on self"", ""impact on others"", or ""impact differences between self and others"", which could possibly result in censorship, needs to be clearly differentiated. Research on the third-person effect needs to differentiate between the following effects: micro vs. macro, alteration vs. stabilization, cumulative vs. non-cumulative, long term vs. short term, and qualitative vs. quantitative.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=13&CA_ID=94,12,2007,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
The Role of Online News Media: From Content Provider to Advocate of Public Debates,Ying-Ting Shih,"democracy, internet, media, news, public sphere","Ideally news media should play the role of ""watchdog"" but in reality news media seldom perform their duties faithfully. This paper tries to explain the gap between ideals and reality of news media's role in a democratic society. The author finds that almost all news media try to be independent and objective as possible as they can, hoping that in doing so they can make more money. As a matter of fact, what people need in a democratic society is not detached news media but civic engagement. This paper suggests that new technologies provide opportunities for the news media to re-define their role in accordance with needs which may arise in a democratic society. For example, news media should change their role from content provider to facilitator of public debates. If they do so, they will not only secure people’s trust but can also survive the challenge of the digital age.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=13&CA_ID=95,12,2007,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The analysis reveals that, contrary to Benjamin’s prediction, the aura of the cultural industry has not been taken shine off thanks to the emphasis on virtual property rights, to the virtual exploitation of audience, and to the virtual production network of digital content, and to the hyper-real effects of digital texts. The articulation of aura and commodity fetishism in the age of digital reproduction has, however, cracked open a space for democratic struggles regardless of the re-created distance between enchanted cultural works and the audience.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=13&CA_ID=99,12,2007,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
The Role of Emotion and Memory for the Elderly in Reading News Stories,"Yean Tsai, Kuo-Jen Tsang","gerontology, news, emotion, memory","A theory on the interaction between news stories and elderly people in Taiwan urban areas is proposed and examined. Twenty subjects aged from 65 to 85 are interviewed and tested on their reactions toward various types of local news. It is observed that current theories on social interaction do not fully account for the communication behaviors of the elderly. According to our study, our informants were of the opinion that the media did not reflect a reliable image of the elderly and did not provide needed information. The media are urged to provide information on family life and health. The present study also surveys the role of emotion and memory during the reception process. It is found that emotion plays an important part in helping the informants decide on which stories to read. Whether the media care for the elderly and are able to entertain them are reported as the main reasons for choosing reading materials. Finally, emotional reaction towards a news story is related to the amount of information which a subject can remember after reading the news.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=12&CA_ID=86,13,2008,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Restructuring the Use Innovativeness Model: How Creativity Matters,"Anne Wan-Ling Hu, Ming-Hone Tsai","curiosity, rate of use, variety of use, creativity skills, intention to adopt innovation","Post-adoption innovation diffusion is an important area of research that has illuminated consumer innovativeness in product use and extended innovation diffusion. The scale of use innovativeness (UI) proposed by Price & Ridgeway (1983) has produced inconsistent results for the rate-of-use and variety-of-uses for a given product due to the heterogeneity of UI components. This study references the componential theory of creativity to redefine the concept of UI. An SEM comparative model analysis demonstrated that UI should include 2 heterogeneous constructs: curiosity and creativity skills. Curiosity can influence users to accept innovative technologies, while creativity skills influence the degree of product usage. Curiosity is the key to an individual's tendency for new technology adoption and also promotes learning and creative thinking, which in turn leads to the emergence of creativity skills. Through creativity skills, curiosity indirectly promotes use diffusion.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=12&CA_ID=87,13,2008,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

First, I highlight the ways in which conflicts and confrontations that photojournalists in Taiwan consistently face arise from the organization of their work. Next, by analyzing the accounts of Taiwanese photojournalists about work experiences, I demonstrate how these photojournalists manipulate and mobilize conflicts and confrontations in the labor process to establish their masculine identities and to bond with each other. In doing so, I illuminate how photojournalists strategize the dominant notions of masculinities to combat their inferior class status both within and outside newspaper agencies. In this vein, I argue that hegemonic notions of masculinities are central to understanding the work of photojournalists in Taiwan.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=12&CA_ID=88,13,2008,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This paper found that news supervision by public opinion, which facilitates social integration, represents an extension of state power.

Using the methods of content analysis and interview, this paper aims to discover the strategies of domestication and tabloidization employed by international news as well as the impacts of national interests and market factors. This research finds that Taiwan's newspapers apply domestication strategies such as sending reporters to cover international news, relying on domestic news sources and connecting international events with domestic influences. Besides, Taiwan's newspapers showed the trend of tabloidization, emphasizing conflict and opposition in international news and applying a large number of images and pictures to tell news stories.

This paper employs text analysis to examine the form of public opinion in two internet forums. The ""publics"" on the internet fall into the following categories: anonymous public, multi-subjective public, symbolic public and minority public. The concept of public sphere in the internet is different from its traditional counterpart. Moreover, participants in the internet are capable of engaging in dialogues regarding public affairs, nevertheless, they tend to lack reflexive thinking and perspective taking abilities. The internet is thus far short of being a forum for deliberative democracy, rather it provides a convenient access for people to speak out.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=11&CA_ID=81,14,2008,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Taking ""the suspicious case of Grand Justice's lobbying for the reconsideration of the Truth Investigation Committee Statute"" as an example, the study uses textual analysis to probe into political talk shows within the specific social context and discusses the discourse strategies of the political talk shows. In addition, the study applies framing theories to identify frame strategies used by guests in the discursive process. The study finds that Pierre Bourdieu's notions of ""dramatisation"" and ""vision du monde"" cannot adequately depict Taiwan's political talk shows. Nonetheless, these political talk shows, failing to function as a public sphere, present themselves together as ""the TV series of blue-green party conflicts in Taiwan"" regardless of varied topics and issues in programs.

What are the Impacts of the Different Payment Mechanisms on the Programming Output of the Cable Networks?,Kuo-Feng Tseng,"cable television, network competition, bundling, a la carte, rating","Theoretically 'free market mechanism' should make the best product and eliminate the bad one. In Taiwan's cable television industry, the operators bundle all the networks in one package for one price. Under the restrain of the diminishing of advertising revenue and the fixed monthly payment, few programming is able to increase the production cost. Eventually most of the programs look similar without differentiation and creativity. This paper considers that the mechanism of 'a la carte', directly charging consumer what they watch, is the other way to improve the performance of the cable television networks.

Lucie Cheng believed that communication education should be designed to do more than cultivate a new generation of journalists. This study focused on the relationship between communication education, the news media, and the people in power. Media courses offered in Shih Hsin University treat communication as a core value. The university criticizes the stigmas of minorities represented in the mainstream media, gender, race, class, and age.

Corporate Citizenship and Media Coverage: From the Perspective of Civil Society,Yie-Jing Yang,"corporate citizenship, civil society, corporate social responsibility, media coverage",This study examined the meaning of corporate citizenship (CC) and its relationship with media coverage. The study focused on the perspective of CC by civil society. The research methodology used in was content analysis. The researchers selected articles from two major Taiwanese newspapers from two different years 1996 and 2006. The total number of samples was 610. The results showed that newspapers began to place greater emphasis on corporate citizenship concerning civil issues. The newspaper articles infrequently used the term “corporate citizenship” Most subjects of the news stories concerned issues of social involvement and economics. Few news articles focused on issues of ethics and law. Most of the news articles in 1996 dealt with issues of producing good products. The issue of corporate responsibility to the support of charities moved to the number one news subject in 2006.Press coverage of large corporations focused on issues of social involvement. Corporate CEOs and corporate employees were the major news sources for CC.,http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=1&CA_ID=57,17,2010,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
The Politics of Gender Differences: Media Representation and Identity Entanglement of Female Athletes,"Peihua Lu, Yupei Chang","female athletes, athletic culture, femininity, media representation, difference in feminist",This research analyzes media images of female athletes to understand the general social perceptions surrounding them. Researchers have observed how female athletes manage conflict between athletic culture and feminine characteristics by describing identity trajectory formation. This research interviewed 12 senior female athletes and used narrative methodology to analyze 93 newspaper reports about the Australian Open Tennis Championship in 2008. This study found that the media represents female athletes as sexual objects or in the role of daughters and mothers. These two images evoke identity conflicts experienced by female athletes on the athletic field. They hinder the achievements of female athletes in the area of body training and empower them to challenge negative feminine characteristics. These images do encourage female athletes to express individual experiences and identify professional achievements.,http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=1&CA_ID=58,17,2010,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

"“Looking East, Going South”: Exploring New Perspectives in Communication Research in the Post-Crisis Era",Yuezhi Zhao,"cultural essentialism, Chinese communication research, Western knowledge hegemony, global capitalism","Taking mainland Chinese communication studies as the main point ofreference, this article discusses four ways in which the idea of “looking East, going South” may ignite the theoretical imagination of communication research in the context of a major global power shift in the post-2008 financial crisis era. First, we need to challenge the hegemony of Western knowledge/power system and deploy “epistemologies of the South” or other post-colonial knowledge systems to develop “cognitive justice” as the epistemological foundation for global social justice. Second, we need to transcend a cultural essentialism that reifies Eastern and Western civilizational divisions. This will enable us to imagine cultural diversity beyond glocalized versions of consumerist capitalism, while rejecting an understanding of “China’s rise” in terms of any zero-sum game between China and the United States within the global capitalist order. Third, we need to transcend the Western, especially U.S. centered “hub-and-spoke” pattern in global communication research, and focus more on the increasingly active east-south and south-south communication and cultural flows. Finally, as far as mainland Chinese communication research is concerned, we need to shift research focus from the urban and coastal areas to the rural and hinterland regions. This also compels us to move beyond a preoccupation with the “history of structure” and “history of technology” to reclaim the “history of the people” by locating their subjectivities, lived experiences, communicative practices, social imaginaries, as well as counter-hegemonic struggles within dynamic historical processes.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=2&CA_ID=44,18,2010,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Resistance to Global Capital or Authoritarian State? Choice of Action in Chinese Media and Society,Yong Hu,"Chinese media, globalization, Southern theory, nation-building","Chinese scholars differ greatly in evaluating the current social situation as well as the overall media picture, specifying different symptoms and giving polarized diagnosis. The Southern theory presents the case for a radical criticism of the Western knowledge production but it is not without limitations of its own. This paper proposes an approach that shifts the emphasis to internal development processes within the social world rather than seeing globalization as the primary mechanism. The author argues that civic resistance should be targeted more to the authoritarian regime which deprives the citizens of their basic freedoms rather than to “American media system and the global hegemony of liberal media principles.”",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=2&CA_ID=45,18,2010,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The Building of Critical Cosmopolitanism and Radical Alternative Media Movement,Yu-Hui Tai,"Chinese nationalism, alternative media, West-centrism, social movement, critical cosmopolitanism","This article focuses on Zhao’s main concerns -- how to build an alternative paradigm to replace global capitalism and the role of critical communication scholars in the process. Zhao applied the concept of “critical cosmopolitanism” to criticize two dominant epistemologies -- the Westcentrism and Chinese Nationalism -- which work as a pair of contradictions and need to be deconstructed simultaneously. This article examines the historical conditions of the possibility of building the international critical linkage to realize critical cosmopolitanism. I argue that there are three “dialogue chasms” which impede the building of critical dialogue space inside China, between China and Taiwan, and between Non-West and West. The way to cross these “dialogue chasms” is to build radical alternative media based on ordinary people’s experiences, especially disenfranchised groups. Through radical alternative media, people in different areas exchange their daily struggle experiences, have sympathy for the suffering of others, and build deeper insight into the structure.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=2&CA_ID=47,18,2010,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

How Do Taiwanese Become Australians? Communication Interaction in Cross-Border Identity,Pei Tsai,"Taiwanese immigrant, ethnic identity, symbolic interactionism, cross-border identity, Australian","This article explores how Taiwanese immigrants become Australians, and considers how communication perspectives enrich identity study. The main theoretical frames in this study combine Barth’s theory of “ethnic boundary” and Mead’s symbolic interactionism, drawing on the strength of each to offset the weakness of the other. By extending and modifying Mead’s theory, Hecht’s communication theory of identity not only makes further linkage between communication and identity, but also provides clear analysis and presentation for observing complex interaction behaviors. The results show studying cross-border identity from the perspective of symbolic interactionism necessitates discovering how “significant symbols”, the key communicative factor to link self with community in Mead’s theories, are generated within interaction process. Grasping the twofold characteristic of significant symbols -- sameness (generated from the interaction within an ethnic group) and difference (generated from the interaction between ethnic groups), completely describes the dual quality of identity -- identical and different. The relationship between communication and identity is not as Mead thought, that identity is the outcomes of communication, but as Hecht pointed out, that identity reflects communication that externalizes identity. Therefore, significant symbols not only internalize into self identification during interaction among members of a community, they also externalize during communication practices to construct identity.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=2&CA_ID=51,18,2010,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Why Communication?,Yaly Chao,"communication theory, audio description, cross symbol study, science of meaning, the cultural creativity industry, meaning system","“Why communication?” is a question that often arises when numerouscommunication scholars reflect on their academic careers. This article utilizes the retrospection of this researcher’s academic journey, from researching audio descriptions, cross-symbols, the science of meaning, as well as the cultural creativity industry, and explores the self-identity and academic preparation of a communication scholar. From the researcher’s perspective, the paths of communication careers are based on a combination of fate and unaltered internal knowledge and interest in the subject. The predestined academic path and unchanged interests of knowledge reflect the “variation and normality” of a communication career. The richness of such an academic career is hidden between the structures of “variation and normality,” where the two are acknowledged to be parts of the whole, in that, each aspect always requires the reflection of its reciprocal to be fully practiced. Thus, the question “why communication?” encompasses not only other questions such as how to explore the meaning of communication behaviors and how to pursue that meaning, but also those questions that seek to know the “self-identity” of communication scholars in such careers. Furthermore, the meaning of communication, to a communication researcher, not only analyzes the finer details and richness of the structure of meaning behind behaviors (such as sharing and creating meanings), but also embraces the actions of pursuing and enriching meaning in our world.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=3&CA_ID=38,19,2011,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

In general, the scientists and journalists surveyed agreed on most of the positive functions of news media although journalists tended to be even more positive. Scientists in general felt science news was too superficial, overly dramatic, and easily caused misunderstanding. When asked about their interaction, journalists were less likely than scientists to agree to allow scientists they have interviewed to check copy before publication.

In-depth interviews with sixteen Taipei Hakka viewers showed that Hakka TV has increased the sense of ethnic identity of metropolitan Hakka in four aspects: self-identification, sense of belonging, ethnic attitude, and ethnic involvement. The golden triangle for Hakka identity formation consists of primordial attachment, interpersonal interaction with significant others and Hakka TV. The role of Hakka TV in constructing a Hakka identity for the metropolitan Taipei Hakka audience lies in the expansion of the sense of belonging and identity of Hakka viewers from the primordial ties within Hakka families to the whole Hakka ethnic group.

What is the difference between Taiwan and the U.S. on government propaganda regulations? To address these questions, this paper is divided into the following three sections: (1) an introduction of U.S. regulations on government propaganda, (2) a review of two significant cases that demonstrate how the U.S. government investigates and rectifies inappropriate propaganda, and (3) an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of U.S. regulations. A comparison between the relevant regulations in Taiwan and those in the U.S. is also preformed. Finally, this study concludes with suggestions for how the Taiwanese government can further revise laws to ensure that regulations on government propaganda are comprehensive. Amendments to related laws should include the following: (1) defining government propaganda and categorizing the different features of propaganda, (2) developing a penalty for violating the laws, (3) requiring the media to disclose sponsor information, and (4) defining the social responsibility of the media and its workers.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=4&CA_ID=22,20,2011,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This study uses textual analysis and online-audience research to target governmental embedded messages, to examine the strategies of these highly contentious messages, their potential effects, and possible contentions in the future. This research has shown that general policy messages tend to be softly marketed in product messages in a “peripheral approach strategy.” This strategy features sentimental and entertainment-oriented tones, sophisticated pictures, and post-production effects. Policy messages that are more controversial tend to be presented in a “central approach strategy,” which characterizes central messages in a “racing frame” of news storytelling. Online-audience research confirms previous findings that in-depth reporting and news talk shows should differ from general talk shows by new regulations, and should refrain from news product placements.

Adopting the perspective of van Dijk's theory of discourse and manipulation, this study finds that two of the newspapers accepting news placements (The China Times and United Daily News) reported on theChinese buying groups using detailed and positive descriptions of the leaders' emotional, moral, and power characteristics. Whereas the other two newspapers (Apple Daily and Liberty Times) made far less reports and provided no positive details regarding the leaders of the buying groups.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=4&CA_ID=25,20,2011,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

By conducting both a content analysis and a framing analysis of GMO news stories from the two mainstream print media, United Daily and China Times from January 1994 to December 2006, this study discovered that scientists and government officials are the predominant sources, whereas descriptions from scientific reports are the most frequently used framing devices in news discourse. Even stories framed as human hazards revealed scientific evidence used to confirm the risk probability generated from science. By deconstructing the implications of news discourse, this study hopes to provide insights into issues particularly related to genetically modified foods, and to highlight the vital role news media play in risk society.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=4&CA_ID=28,20,2011,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The emergence of multiculturalism has created the advocacy of both native and multicultural sciences. Based on multicultural education perspectives, this study analyzes the content of the indigenous TV science program Little Science Hunters, as well as the ideas of its production team. Results show that: 1. The program adopts the “culturally responsive pedagogy” approach, emphasizing indigenous cultural identity, as well as inheritance and innovation of traditional culture. The program aims to empower indigenous people and increase their self-confidence and cultural awareness. 2. The TV production team must negotiate with different informational resources to construct interpretative frameworks of the program. The science group helps to transform and reveal scientific theories embedded in indigenous people’s traditional knowledge, and the indigenous group helps to represent traditional knowledge. 3.

Internet-Driven Democratization and Counter-Attacks by the State: The Experience of Malaysian Online Media,Teck-Peng Chang,"Internet, democratization, Malaysia, online media","In numerous Asian countries, traditional mainstream media have been forced to function as ideological state apparatuses under the tight control of authoritarian regimes. Dissidents can only voice their opinions through so-called ""illegal"" publications, or ""legal"" publications with limited circulation. However, because of the widespread use of computers and the Internet, the state can no longer control the marketplace of ideas. This paper analyzes the role and contribution of the Internet in the democratization of Malaysia by challenging the effectiveness of state regulation of the mass media, and promoting pluralism in the public sphere. This study also presents a discussion on how economic and political changes have catalyzed public use of the Internet, and simultaneously prompted the state to launch counterattacks against perceived ""threats"" of new media.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=4&CA_ID=21,20,2011,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

A total of 30 intensive interviews were conducted on journalists in Taiwan, from which this study collected 155 conflict events. Data analysis categorized the 155 conflict events into 7 types: differing news value, lack of consideration, immoral behavior, unjust treatment, trying to interfere or control news, job incompetence and scooping or missing news. This study also found that respondents had different emotional intensities regarding the different types of conflict events, and different emotional intensities were associated with different types of communication strategies. For instance, the lack of consideration from a superior yielded significantly more soft emotions than differing news value from a superior did, and when respondents felt intense sadness during a conflict, they were more likely to use yielding as a communication strategy. Further findings are discussed in this paper.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=5&CA_ID=17,21,2012,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The results showed that the socially privileged group tended to have ""nonsimultaneous multiple media and multiple brands"" news consumption behavior, whereas the socially underprivileged group tended to have ""single medium and multiple brands"" news consumption behavior. Additionally, the socially underprivileged group were less likely to consume news from both television and the Internet simultaneously.

The development of television news in Taiwan is divided into five stages according to changes in news production, consumption, and regulation. During the first two stages, from 1962 to 1980, despite control from the authoritarian regime, for a short period the three terrestrial television stations competed in news production and journalists had a certain degree of autonomy. Because of the cartel in television production from 1980 to 1993, profits generated by the television stations increased and the working conditions of journalists improved dramatically. Nevertheless, these stations were completely controlled by the KMT government during the third stage. In the mid-1990s because the government lifted the ban on broadcasting license, new participants in the TV market led to competence in news production and temporary autonomy for journalists. However, during the final two stages, working conditions and the degree of autonomy for the average journalist declined because of the privatization of the media.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=6&CA_ID=9,22,2012,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This study found that cable television system operators of public access channels have the greatest degree of access to programming. Government agencies of the central and local government were among those in second place and civil associations were ranked third, whereas purely personal access was negligible. These results show that over two-thirds of programming time that are intended for public forums are used by cable system operators and the government.

The results showed that the majority of the interviewees could be categorized as constrained behavior publics (i.e., high problem recognition and high constraint recognition). The results of multiple regressions indicated that problem recognition can only predict passive information processing, not active information seeking. The variables of problem recognition and problem involvement can predict active information seeking. In addition, people who are categorized as high problem involvement and low constraint recognition are more supportive of global warming-related policies.

This study uses studies on the social support systems used to increase journalists' resilience to examine Taiwanese journalists' reactions. In-depth interviews were conducted with 15 TV journalists. This study found that journalists who cover severe disasters experience traumatic stress, although most are not aware of this fact at the time. Those who recognize traumatic stress typically attempt self-adjustment and rarely rely on social support or counseling interventions. For the social environment of Taiwan, our distinctive findings showed that journalists tend to find support from their audiences or public opinion, relying on traditional cultural rituals, such as inoculations, excuses, and remedies.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=6&CA_ID=5,22,2012,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This study addresses the development from 2 perspectives, television news texts and its news practice, through the concept of “new media technology.” For 2 months we analyzed the content of seven 24-h television news channels that run between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM, and conducted in-depth interviews with television news reporters and producers to examine how new media information has been incorporated in traditional television coverage. The results indicate that new media information has been overused, and has become the source of sensational news in traditional television.

Criticism Regarding Taiwan’s Emergency Warning Broadcasting System (EWBS) Based on a Policy Analysis of Digital TV Transition,Hamilton Cheng,"Japan Tohoku earthquake, public service broadcasting, risk society, Emergency Warning Broadcasting System (EWBS), digital television","After the great East Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011, Taiwan reacted to it by engaging in a series of discussions addressing a nationwide emergency broadcasting system. Surprisingly, Chunghwa Telecom argued that it has no capacity to provide real-time broadcasting. The burden of service provision is on radio broadcasting. However, the radio broadcasting industry does not run data broadcasting services, even after the analogue switchover in 2012. This draws a contradictory picture of the size and scope of ICT development, which has made substantial achievements in Taiwan in nearly every advanced service, except for alert broadcasts. This research analyzed the cause of this problem. A policy review revealed that the success, failure, and recurrence of digital broadcasting implementation have cycled in the past 10 years. In questioning how to change a policy issue drastically, a risk society concept is articulated with the divided governmental sectors. Is there a light at the end of the tunnel of the dark days of Taiwanese digital TV terrestrial broadcasting? Because of the emergency warning broadcasting request, the findings of this research shows that risk communications for climate change provide a reason to study and discuss TV digitization continually within the context of the radical modernization process.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=7&CA_ID=31,23,2013,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The combination of increased market competition and reduced journalism skills has led to declining wages for Taiwanese journalists. However, the wage system is a social construct that is influenced by specific political economy factors, the behaviors of economic institutions, and the effects of the industrial market. Therefore, we adopt a critical political economy approach to propose that social wage problems result from power issues, and that the solutions to these problems are based on policy decisions.

The area has recently been criticized for being boring and lacking in creative ideas. Its future development urgently needs new perspectives. In this paper, we propose to introduce the narrative approach, which many social sciences disciplines have welcomed since the 1990s, and suggest viewing mass communication as a narration of personal experiences, mutual relations, and storytelling through intermediate channels, such as the mass media, rather than as process fulfilling the goals of the message sender. Therefore, one should view the purposes of mass communication to express emotion, arouse the imagination, help listen to one another, and build a sense of community, to experience the meaning of life and to beautify the poetic life.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=7&CA_ID=34,23,2013,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The CCP held a series of “Grand Overseas Propaganda” meetings since the end of 2008 and adopted a radical expansion policy. The CCP actively co-opted Chinese private capitalists and built a new triangle alliance that comprises-- Chinese state banks, Chinese private capitalists, and overseas clientaele capitalists. Since then, the alliance has acquired media corporations in the United Kingdom, United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. One such example is Wanda, which became the world’s largest movie theater owner in 2012. These types of media acquisitions prove that the first goal in the expansion of the “Go Global” policy is media distribution.

In particular, the rise of network literature web sites has assisted in the rapid growth of the network novel market. However, the fast commercialization of the network novel has resulted in writers looking for quick success, rather than engaging in the creative process of writing. In this study, we explored the case of Qidian, the largest network literature web site in China, to prove this theory. The company expects writers to adhere to several strategies. The pay-per-word strategy causes writers to prioritize the length of the story over quality. The formatting strategy of the network novel results in the excessive dependence of the writer on a predefined narrative formula. The ranking strategy limits the writer to a selection of story plots that the readers are most interested in.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=25&CA_ID=206,24,2013,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

In this study, we analyzed the daily evening news content of the Public Television Service (PTS) and 3 commercial television stations. Results reveal that the cable television stations embed online videos in an average of 7-9 news items presented in the daily evening news. The PTS broadcasts fewer online videos. The online videos shown on the commercial television stations cover news categories that are less concerned with public-interest issues. They broadcast more soft news, entertainment news, and human-interest news stories than are shown on the PTS. Using the results of in-depth interviews, we show that online videos have become part of the database of a commercial television station.

In contrast to previous studies, we focused on the audience response to 3 new types of IPTV to analyze their competitiveness in the Taiwanese television market. Using the niche theory as a theoretical framework, we investigated the competition among 3 types of IPTV: PPStream, Tudou, and YouTube. An online survey was used to collect data for this study and 1,702 valid questionnaires were obtained. The data analysis shows that YouTube occupies the top position in terms of niche breadth, niche overlap, and competitive superiority.

This study used a nationwide telephone survey of the adult population and in-depth interviews with the stakeholders implementing the program. Survey results show that perceptions of the program were poor and that very few people supported it. Factors influencing support for drug substitution treatments and needle- syringe programming, varied. Nevertheless, nearly half of the survey respondents defined injecting drug users (IDU) with HIV/AIDS as patients and approximately one third defined them as victims. These results reveal an empathetic attitude and contradict the opinion of certain interviewees who described the Taiwanese public as conservative and narrow-minded. The study suggests an improvement to campaign implementation and evaluation strategies, and urges decision-makers not to underestimate the capacity of the Taiwanese public to accept Harm Reduction Program.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=25&CA_ID=212,24,2013,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Ambivalent Attitudes and Advertising Avoidance Approach,Chingching Chang,"affect primacy hypothesis, Taiwan communication survey, advertising avoidance, ambivalent attitudes","Drawing upon ambivalent attitude literature, this study explored attitudes toward advertising in Taiwan. This study proposes that people generally hold ambivalent attitudes toward advertising, and their affective evaluation and cognitive evaluation conflict. In particular, people may perceive advertisements as simultaneously irritating (the affective component) and informative (the cognitive component). Data from the Taiwan Survey Database, based on nationwide face-to-face interviews with Taiwanese people, support this proposition. Moreover, people who hold more ambivalent attitudes tend to avoid advertisements to a greater degree and approach advertisements to a lesser degree. Finally, this study proposes that the avoidance and approach orientation of behavior moderates affect primacy effects. In other words, affect primacy effects emerge only when the probed behaviors are avoidance oriented.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=26&CA_ID=215,25,2014,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Employing a theoretical framework of problematic Internet use and media habits, social augmentation, and social displacement hypotheses, the author examined the relationship between individual differences, habits, and online activities, and their impact on offline face-to-face interaction. Results from structural equation models and bootstrapped mediational analyses indicated that a) strong preferences for online interaction, b) using the Internet when feeling lonely and, c) using the Internet habitually are critical factors that predict subsequent online activities. Among these factors, habitual Internet use exerted the strongest predictive power. Among online activities, the frequency of social network site use positively predicted the frequency of face-to-face personal interaction.

This study explored movie network characteristics to identify the central figures in the Taiwan movie industry. Taiwanese-speaking actors have created a small network that intersects with a large Mandarin-speaking network, forming a broad Taiwan movie network. According to this formation, most central actors speak Mandarin, and Taiwanese-speaking actors are peripheral. Ko Chun-Hsiung and Yu Han Shiang are central figures in the actor and director networks, respectively, probably because they are able to cross the language barrier and, thus, have numerous opportunities to participate in filming projects. Dominant actors are mostly supporting actors that shape the acting environments of filming, and are crucial stars in the Taiwan movie industry.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=26&CA_ID=220,25,2014,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

In response to the changing landscape, research on social movements needs to re-conceptualize actors and to examine corresponding rhetorical strategies. With reference to relevant literature and social movement cases, this study proposes four rings of actors, extending from actors with the highest commitment in the center to actors on the periphery. This paper contends that the actors of the fourth ring (i.e., those occupying the outlying ring) can be characterized by autonomy, individuation, anonymity, and lurking behaviors, they most epitomize the nature of social movement actors in the Internet age.

Regrets about American Historiography on Modern Chinese Transformation: From a Rhetorical Point of View,Xiao Xiaosui,"modern transformation, rhetoric, historiographical writing, history of thought, modernization-oriented reform *","This essay explores the relationship between historiographical writing and rhetoric. The author examines and discusses, from a rhetorical standpoint, four major historiographies that have substantially shaped American historical writing on the period of China’s transition to a modern state (1890s-1920s). The historiographical writings include John K. Fairbank & Edwin O. Reischauer’s China: Tradition and Transformation (Fairbank & Reischauer, 1979／陳仲丹、潘興明與龐朝陽譯，1995), Joseph R. Levenson’s Confucian China and its modern fate (Levenson, 1968 ／鄭大華、任菁譯，2000), Thomas A. Metzger’s Escape from predicament: Neo-Confucianism and China’s evolving political culture (1977), and Hao Chang’s Chinese intellectuals in crisis: Search for order and meaning (I890-1911) (Chang, 1987 ／高力克、王躍譯，2006). The examination and discussion in this paper expresses regret for the lack of rhetorical insight into these historiographical writings. Nevertheless, the author demonstrates that even within the historiographical frameworks of these works, rhetoric has served to construct many of the historical “facts” or “findings” that those writers have claimed to be true.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=27&CA_ID=224,26,2014,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Treated as representative of poetic wisdom in contrast to scientific knowledge, metaphors serve well to bridge the gap between verbal rhetoric and visual rhetorics. Drawing on Lakoff & Johnson, Ricœur, Vico and Aristotle, the author emphasizes the experiential and sociocultural characteristics of metaphors, which are highly relevant to our bodily existence and daily life. Then the significance of visualization in rhetorics and the role of both visual and verbal metaphors in the process are discussed. To enhance understanding of rhetorics as perception-based, the author refers to Gestalt psychologist Rudolf Arnheim for his rich study on visual thinking and expression creativity, thereby demonstrating that metaphors are not only at the core of communication competence but also are essential to multimedia literacies in the present network era.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=27&CA_ID=225,26,2014,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Beyond the Visuality and Revisit of Rhetoric: A Preliminary Study on Visual Rhetoric in the Digital Age,Chih-Yung Chiu,"digital, visuality, visual rhetoric, software *","In the age of digital distribution, visual graphics and moving images have generated significant change ontologically. Traditional semiotic approach that emphasizes on analyzing symbolic elements has gradually been replaced by an abstract quality of mathematical logic and information architecture that can make a fluid transition between different states of materiality. Through the process of algorithmic computing, symbolic codes are generated to be recognizable symbols, signs, or images based on traditional conventions. To the extent, this research attempts to place visual rhetoric into the digital era in order to explore the essence and significance of digital visual rhetoric.

This paper outlines dialectics and utopianism by referring to the necessity of rejoinder, the limitedness/effectiveness of advocacy, and the strategy of action inherent in the rhetoric of heteroglossia. Furthermore, a possible path is explored for practicing the ethics of heteroglossia by articulating Bakhtin’s stratifications of language, as implicated in the outer dialogicity of polyphonic novels and Judith Butler’s parodic performance.

An island-wide telephone survey of 1,093 residents in Taiwan was conducted within one week after the disaster occurred. The results showed that people’s perception of the risk was primarily determined by their political trust. People who had lower political trust were likely to be more concerned, whereas those who trusted the government more tended to support nuclear energy. Attention to television news was positively correlated with risk perception, those who paid more attention to television news were likely to oppose nuclear energy. Additionally, people with more objective knowledge about nuclear energy tended to accept its risk and support its use. Male respondents exhibited a higher tolerance of the risk than their female counterparts did. Consistent with past literature, Pan-Blue party supporters were more in favor of nuclear energy than Pan-Green party supporters.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=27&CA_ID=229,26,2014,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The results of a nationally representative sample of 1,007 people indicated that Taiwanese people supported four of the six policies investigated in this study. In contrast to imposing an energy tax and developing a nuclear power plant, which were accepted by less than 50% of the respondents, all other policies attained high acceptance ratings (80% ~ 95%). Public support for developing a nuclear power plant was swayed by people’s political orientation. However, reframing the nuclear power issue was more effective for people who were politically independent than for those with a specific political orientation. Further regression analysis revealed that the factors predicting various policy issues differed, indicating that people have varying attitudes toward climate change policies. According to the findings of this study, the differential patterns of policy support are explained, and recommendations are proposed for both research and practical purposes.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=29&CA_ID=244,28,2015,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Hedonism as a Driving Force: Exploring Online Shopping as a Form of Media Entertainment,ChingChing Chang,,"Drawing on the concept of hedonism determination, this paper explores the hedonic functions of online shopping. Data from the 2013 Taiwan Communication Survey revealed three critical findings. First, people who use the Internet for entertainment are more likely to shop online. Second, among the four perspectives (i.e., economy, free-ofconstraints, risk aversion, and hedonism), hedonism was the most accurate predictor of online shopping. Third, when affective beliefs (hedonism related beliefs) conflicted with cognitive beliefs derived from the economic, free-of-constraints, and risk aversion perspectives, people were less likely to shop online.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=30&CA_ID=245,29,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
New Perspectives on the Mood Management Effect of Playing Motion Sensor Games: Examining the Influences of Arousal and Excitation Potential,Yen-Shen Chen,"excitatory potential, entertainment media, mood management theory, video game, violence","Mood management theory is a critical element of entertainment media studies, therefore, this study adopted this theory to examine the influence of arousal and excitation potential on the emotions and enjoyment of players, specifically when they play motion sensor games. The findings provide new thinking of the application to video gaming. Two factors, arousal and violence, were adopted to examine their influence on the emotional state and enjoyment of 151 participants exposed to two levels of arousal (stress and boredom) and excitation potential (through a violent boxing game and non-violent bowling game). The results indicated that playing motion sensor games generated a mood management effect, in other words, gaming enhanced the players’ emotional state. However, no significant difference in mood management effects was observed between the arousal and excitation potential variables. Therefore, the author claims that people who are under stress might not need to adjust their level of arousal and they can have a positive emotional experience even while playing violent games. In addition, in contrast to mood management theory, the association between mood management and enjoyment is weak. The author found that excitation potential can increase involvement and enjoyment. The author proposes the aforementioned viewpoints as a new means for rethinking mood management theory in the context of interactive entertainment media.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=30&CA_ID=246,29,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
How to Present Experiences in Stories: Some Phenomenological Propositions,Wei-San Sun,"social phenomenology, story, temporality, narrative, Verstehen","This article assumes a phenomenological standpoint that conceives story-telling as representing experiences and recounting actions and storylistening as constructing experiences and understanding meanings. It adopts Schutz’s social phenomenological concepts of inner horizon and outer horizon, temporality, and “Verstehen” as conceptual foundations that offer propositions to provide guidance, respectively, for selecting themes, organizing story events, and expressing emotions. In particular, the article uses the concepts of inner horizon and outer horizon to demonstrate the wide spectrum of possible themes inherent in any intentional subject, applies the concept of temporality to observe story structure and logical development among events, extends the concept of “Verstehen” as a means to building feelings of empathy, and suggests the use of selected subjective viewpoints to anchor the meanings of events or phenomena. These propositions may assist storytellers in expanding their sensitivity of theme selection, organizing narrative contents, formulating structure, and evoking empathy.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=30&CA_ID=247,29,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Preliminary Investigation and Interpretation of Readers’ Appreciation of Graphics in Nonfiction Picture Book Narratives: Winners of International Picture Book Awards on the History of Science,Yu-Chai Lai,"nonfiction narrative, iconographic narrative, iconographic interpretation, picture book, reader response *","Multimodal narratives are aimed at understanding the textual structure of various modules and analyzing how different modules generate synergistic effects. This article elaborates on how narrators transfer materials to multimodal pictorial narratives and explains the interactions among texts, readers, and reader responses. When nonfiction picture book narrators convert scientific materials into pictures and text, they refer to scientists’ notes, specimens, and photographs to improve the credibility of the content. Narrators can quote scientific theorems, formulae, and data to satisfy audience expectations regarding evidence. Narrative filler information can be collected directly from real life experiences, enabling the audience to experience a profound sense of connection to the life story of the protagonist. Nonfiction picture books provide aesthetic exchange processes through which readers can appreciate the books and identify with the content based on their real-life experiences.

Public Perception of Nanotechnology and Its Policy in Taiwan,"Tsung-Jen Shih, Yi-Ping Lin, Tsun-Jen Cheng","public perception, nanotechnology, labeling, risk communication","This study seeks to understand how the general public in Taiwan makes sense of an emerging technology -- nanotechnology, and its related policy. Based on a nationally representative survey (n = 941), this study found that education, positive scientific values, Internet use, and benefit perception were positively associated with public support, whereas risk perception and moral perception had a negative relationship. These findings were largely in consistence with existent literature mostly generated from the U.S. and Europe about the limited role of scientific knowledge. In terms of public attitudes toward the policy of labeling nanoproducts, the predictors were quite different. Only risk perception, moral conflict, and support for nanotechnology were found to correlate with the necessity of labeling in a positive way. The association between labeling and some negative perceptions of nanotechnology (risk and moral conflict) suggests that people may view labeling as a warming mechanism.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=30&CA_ID=250,29,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Data from the 2014 Taiwan Communication National Survey Database were used in this study. The results demonstrate that Internet literacy and parental mediation influence online experiences and increase life satisfaction. Active parental mediation and socialstructural literacy are negatively correlated with online risks. Active parental mediation also increases adolescents’ Internet skills, self-efficacy, critical literacy, social-structural literacy, and tool literacy. Furthermore, higher levels of active parental mediation, higher information literacy, and less online risks encountered lead to higher life satisfaction in adolescents.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=252,30,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Data were collected from a nationwide random sample of 1,959 adolescents aged 9 ~ 17. The results demonstrate that the majority of parents employed higher levels of restrictive mediation strategies than evaluative mediation strategies. Moreover, neither restrictive nor evaluative mediation strategies were associated with reduced negative Internet use. However, evaluative mediation positively predicted educational Internet use.

In addition, the marketing concept of touch points is introduced, and the key touch points for each UGC decision-making stage are summarized herein. Sequential pattern mining of secondary data collected from the 2014 Taiwan Communication Survey reveals results supportive of the SSVS model. People both highly and minimally engage with UGC, and UGC creators complete the four decision-making stages of SSVS. However, people who do not create UGC tend to skip the stage of sharing. In addition, social media and content sharing sites are the two critical touch points across the four decision-making stages. Furthermore, individuals highly engaged UGC and creators of UGC are more likely to use multiple touch points and have varied touch point combination patterns across the four decision-making stages.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=255,30,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
A Preliminary Study on the Visual Rhetorical Consciousness and Practice of Mikhail Bakhtin’s Chronotope Concept: A Case of the 2014 Taipei LGBT Parade,Hsiao-Yung Wang,,"This paper elaborates the visual rhetorical consciousness of Mikhail Bakhtin’s chronotope concept through theoretical problematization and theoretical reconstruction. First, it attempts to outline Barthes’ perspective on visual rhetoric and its time-space category by referring to the concurrent word-image, symbolic systematicity, and outer dialogicity. Second, an alternative approach is explored for grasping the dynamics and functions of visual rhetoric by articulating Mikhail Bakhtin’s chronotope concept. Furthermore, the visual rhetorical consciousness of chronotope could be defined as “the meaning parabola which projects from word to image,” “the symbolic system which proceeds from sequence to disorder,” “the ideological environment which struggles from the local to the global.” Finally, a preliminary analysis of the primary vision of the 2014 Taipei LGBT parade is conducted to valuate the effectiveness and persuasiveness embodied by specific visual rhetorical strategies.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=256,30,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Risk Construction and Communication of Food Safety Issues: A Comparison of News Media and Governments,"Yu-Chan Chiu, Ssu-Han Yu","government press release, risk construction, risk communication, food safety, health risk, news coverage","During food safety crises, news media and governments play key roles in disseminating risk information. By adopting the methodology of discourse analysis, this study examines how four major newspapers in Taiwan and the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) constructed and communicated health risks during two food safety crises involving starch and cooking oil. This study found that experts quoted in news coverage emphasized long-term risks, whereas government officials highlighted immediate risks. In addition, experts used metaphors and provided examples to illustrate the risks, whereas government officials based their risk discourse on laws. These contrasting approaches might be due to the differences in the perspectives on risk assessment or the differences in the nature of news reports and government press releases. When comparing risk discourse in news coverage to the TFDA’s press releases, much common ground can be found, however, this study discovered that the latter included more expressions indicating uncertainty. Experts’ “high risk” language and officials’ legal discourse might not sufficiently assist the public in responding to food safety issues.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=257,30,2016,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Examining the Theoretical Equipment Used to Study International Cultural Flow: A Disassembly and Modification of “Cultural Proximity”,Ti Wei,"cultural proximity, international communication, international cultural flow","“Cultural proximity” is probably the most cited and applied concept in the literature on international cultural exchange in Taiwan. However, most studies and applications use it as a theorem without the necessary introduction to its formation context, possible revisions, or the proper adjustment required for its application. Consequently, speculative and methodological fallacies have appeared in many studies. This article reexamines the theoretical concept of cultural proximity and its employment in Taiwanese communication studies through a critical and metatheoretical review of the relevant literature. Significant empirical data are also provided that verify the central argument of the theory. Finally, this article suggests a modification of the concept according to the theories of cultural identity and political economy.

Beyond J-Pop the Soundtrack: Aesthetic-Industrial Shaping of Japanese Ren’ai Dorama (1990s and 2000s) Through Classic Japanese and Western Hit Songs,Eva Tsai,"J-pop, Japanese TV drama, TV producers, classic hits, soundtracks, scriptwriters","Japanese ren’ai dorama, a television genre of contemporary love stories that gained popularity domestically and regionally in the 1990s, has exhibited close affinity with the music genre J-Pop, which emerged in the same decade. The commercially viable J-Pop genre supplied theme songs and soundtracks to ren’ai dorama, infusing the television genre with a chic, upbeat, and romantic quality. Despite J-Pop’s dominant role, other music genres have informed the aesthetics and sensibilities of ren’ai dorama. This article presents a case study of alternative music and soundtrack choices in the same production context. Specifically, the study examined dramas produced by scriptwriter Nojima Shinji and Tokyo Broadcasting System in-house producer Ito Kazuhiro. Their collaborated works mobilized classic Japanese and Western hit songs from the 1960s and 1970s to underscore the emotional subjectivity of adolescent youths. Rather than pursuing romantic expectations as encouraged by J-Pop, their love stories sought to affirm an empathetic aesthetic that also contributed to this cultural form.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=32&CA_ID=261,31,2017,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Nation Building and Nation Branding: Discursive Transformation toward Taiwanization in Taiwan’s Post-War Tourism Policy,Shuling Huang,"nation branding, nation building, discourse, tourist gaze, destination image","This study explores the construction of “tourist gaze” by examining Taiwan’s tourism policies from the 1950s to the present day. It identifies four distinctive stages through which discourses of tourism policy has shifted from the paradigm of nation building to that of nation branding. The constructed gazing has also changed from “Chineseness” to “Taiwanness.” This study showed that tourism is an ideological state apparatus that materializes banal nationalism. The trend towards nation branding seems to undermine the rhetoric of nation building, as the logic of economic competitiveness replaces the importance of nationalism. However, the attempt to construct Taiwan as an object of tourist gaze in light of globalization, paradoxically, helps construct Taiwan as a new nation and realize its cultural subjectivity. Tourism thus also participates in Taiwan’s cultural Taiwanization.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=32&CA_ID=262,31,2017,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Changes in Media Role Perception and the Third-Person Effect,"Huei-Ling Liu, Ven-Hwei Lo",,"Journalists’ perception of the role the news media play in society has been central to the study of journalism and journalistic practices. Using two national surveys of working journalists in Taiwan in 2004 and 2014, this study examined the relationship between journalists’ perceptions of the media’s role and the influence of the news. The results revealed that in both surveys, two media roles, namely information dissemination and interpretation, were perceived as important by most journalists in Taiwan. In addition, the present findings demonstrated that the respondents considered other people to be more influenced by the news than themselves. Notably, the perceived effect on others was a significant and positive predictor of the journalists’ perceptions of the importance of the media’s role. Moreover, these results validated the applicability of the third-person effect hypothesis in media role perceptions.

A nationwide telephone survey was conducted on a representative sample of Taiwanese adults. The results indicated that cognitive evaluation of the energy issue and environmental belief were positively related to support for renewable energy. However, environmental behaviors and action efficacy positively predicted intention to use renewable energy. The predicted power of active communication, such as taking the initiative to seek relevant information and share it with others, was stronger than that of information diversity on both support and use intention. Generally, the study revealed the value of including active engagement -- related factors when promoting subjects that entail environmental norms broader than mere appeal to self-interest, such as renewable energy.

Party alignment, political interests, and value conflicts were observed to be negatively associated with party ambivalence. Those with greater party ambivalence had more difficulty making decisions and tended to engage in issue voting. Their decision strategy was oriented toward selecting the right candidate, rather than the right party. Moreover, ambivalent voters read more newspapers and were more likely to avoid news channels with clear party biases during the campaign period.

Numerous scholars have argued that the Internet has made immediacy the prime goal of journalism, which has damaged its virtue. Whether the Internet has deteriorated the quality of journalism has yet to be determined. Few studies have investigated journalistic practices involving the Internet. Upon a review of the literature, this study discussed “a fetishism of the present” in journalism.

Preliminary Analyses of the Effect of Readers’ Transmedia Interpretation of Pictorial Narratives on Aesthetic Communication: Picturebooks and Interactive e-Picturebooks as Examples,Yu-Chai Lai,"Intermedial interpreation, aesthetic communication, transmedia narrative, pictorial narrative, picture book","In the study, picture books and interactive e-book adaptations of picture books were used to explore readers’ transmedia interpretations of the same pictorial narrative. Transmedia participation and intermedia interpretation are related, regarding generic intertextuality, referential intertextuality and imagination. Intermedia interpretation occurs when a reader familiar with the traditional form of a certain picture book is presented with an interactive electronic version. The reader experiences negation and becomes fascinated by the interactive design of the e-picture book. The new form stimulates the reader's interest in further interpreting and exploring the narrative.

Preliminary Study on the Media Representation and Anchoring Effect of Wage News: Job Bank’s Youth Labor Starting Salary Survey Report as an Example,Wei-Ching Wang,"job bank, anchoring effect, youth labor, starting salary level, salary survey news","This study examined the influence of sociocultural factors on salary depression. In particular, the influence of the media representation of the job bank starting salary survey on the starting salaries and socioeconomic realities of youth labor in Taiwan was investigated. The researcher found that news reports on the job bank starting salary survey were fraught with validity concerns in their representation of depressed trends in youth salary levels. These surveys are a primary influence in Taiwanese youth labor’s socioeconomic reality, representations of survey results are the basis of anchoring effects, price collusions, salary climate perceptions, and panic effects. In this paper, the author discusses the complex role of the news media in the salary market, information power and order in the labor salary market, and suggestions for future improvements in salary information market disorder.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=34&CA_ID=274,33,2018,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
True or Fake: Audience Perspectives on the Truthfulness of Animated News,Ching-Chih Chiang,"animated news, empirical truth, modality, news truthfulness, sensory truth, technological truth","By conducting 40 in-depth interviews with viewers who had been asked to watch animated news, produced by the NMA (Next Media Animation), this study explored audience definitions of news as well as their evaluations and expectations regarding the truthfulness of animated news. The results indicated that viewers tended to interpret animated news and evaluate its truthfulness based on common sense, personal experiences, news organization, intertextuality, news types, and source authority, rather than the animations themselves. Moreover, with the exception of a specific group who expressed favorable opinions regarding animated news, most viewers paid little attention to these animations. The majority of audiences perceive the aim of news animations to be entertainment, symbolism, and emphasis. Animation used in news is considered a type of re-enactment or simulation of the oral narration generated by a voice over. Moreover, animation is expected to convey sensory or technological truth rather than empirical truth.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=316,34,2018,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
When News Meets Social Media: Journalistic Practice in the Field of Ambient Media,Wen-Ping Kuo,"ambient media, capital, field theory, habitus, journalistic practice","Ambient media, with its broad, asynchronous, lightweight, and “always on” characteristics, has been integrated into the everyday lives of media consumers. The field of digital journalism has established a new relationship with the field of ambient media. Based on French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory, this paper explores the production practice of digital journalism in the field of ambient media with analytical angles ranging from the individual to organizational level. By interviewing 30 news workers, this study discovered that the structuring of a “social media habitus,” which promotes the pursuit of “consumer capital,” achieved a legitimated status in the field of ambient media. The criteria for judging news values with respect to quantitativeness is therefore re-enforced through the practice of news production.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=315,34,2018,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Hypertext Narrative Design Analysis of News for Dummies: Discussion of the Order and Structure of Elements,Ya-Hui Chen,"hypertext, internet news, narrative order, narrative structure, news for dummies, news narrative","This study investigated the role of hypertext in the process of telling a news story. Qualitative and textual research have paid little attention to news stories. This article selected the narrative elements of order and structure to discuss the differences between contemporary and traditional news. Regarding order, the narrative of hypertext news stories has shifted from a time-oriented model to a spatial or visual screen design. In terms of structure, it has transformed from a primarily convergent structure to a combination of convergent and divergent structures. News for dummies no longer provides only a simple report but also expands the imagination of individuals with respect to news stories and identifies more appropriate narrative structures.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=314,34,2018,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Based on a literature review, this study identified nine brand personalities, three of which were negative brand personalities and the remaining six were positive brand personalities. Adopting Sirgy’s self-congruity theory, this study predicted that five major consumer personality traits would correlate to the brand personalities of the six electronic newspapers, which in turn would be demonstrated to affect the frequency of use of these newspapers by consumers. This study adopted a questionnaire survey to collect data, and 426 undergraduate students in the field of communication studies completed the questionnaire. The data analysis revealed that most respondents preferred the brand personalities of being competent and responsible, which were characteristics that also influenced their use of these electronic newspapers.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=313,34,2018,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The means through which the media influences people dealing with a significant social risk issue was also investigated. In this study, a nationwide telephone survey was conducted and 1,269 samples were collected while the Legislative Yuan established regulations for the Cross-Strait Trade Agreement.

A corpus analysis of long-term data collection focuses on how newspapers have portrayed organic food during 1987-2016. The findings reveal that in the period of organic food development, “agriculture” can be regarded as the focus of news reports on the subject of organic food. In the medium term, shifting from agricultural activities to business themes means shifting the focus from production to consumption. In recent years, the vocabulary of farmers has been investigated, with a focus on describing the relationship and ethics of producers, crops, and land.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=311,34,2018,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Evolution of the Debate Surrounding the Anti-Media Monopolization Law and Regulations,Kuo-Feng Tseng,"anti-media monopolization, concentration, diversity of speech, media regulation, merger and acquisition","This study reviewed the trends and characteristics of media merger and acquisition cases in Taiwan, finding that the current related regulations are not implemented appropriately. Comparing the evolution of different drafts of the anti-media monopolization law, this study concludes that the latest draft remains too focused on traditional media and may be unable to effectively regulate online media. Moreover, rigid restrictions on mergers and acquisitions may discourage innovation and overseas competition. Rather than prohibiting mergers between media and banking or media and any other industries, having effective fit and proper ownership tests is the key regulatory factor. A draft that includes such measures alongside regulations to protect media workers’ rights, independent news rooms, and diversified financial sources of media productions can make significant strides toward resolving the media monopolization dilemma and safeguarding diversity of speech while preserving opportunities for media innovation.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=39&CA_ID=325,35,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Media Citizenship in Taiwan: Media Use and the Needs of Ethnic Television among the New Immigrants in Taiwan,Pei Tsai,"new immigrants in Taiwan, immigrant media, ethnic television, media citizenship, communication rights","The study explored the practice of media citizenship among new immigrants in Taiwan. Based on face-to-face interviews with 400 new immigrants, this study found that more than 70% of new immigrants think Taiwan should establish a specialized television station for new immigrants and migrant workers. The channel should be accessible via both TV and the Internet. The preferred language and subtitles combination for the programs is the immigrants’ mother tongue language with Chinese subtitles. The practice of media citizenship among new immigrants and migrant workers in Taiwan must employ a cultural hybridity approach to compensate for the problems of essentialism and unawareness of class differences that can occur from multiculturalism. Media citizenship can also be improved using a model of multiple publics. Every ethnic group in Taiwan should be entitled to equal access to public broadcasting services in their own language.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=39&CA_ID=324,35,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

(2) How do partners negotiate and reconstruct romantic relationship scripts when their interactions appear to be unsatisfactory? Seven university student couples were recruited for this study. In-depth interviews revealed that the couples were more likely to be influenced by societal expectations to follow mainstream romantic relationship scripts. However, several romantic scripts identified in this study, such as sharing the payment for dates, premarital sexual behaviors, and nonconventional gender role expectations and performances, suggest that the interviewees could deconstruct traditional romantic scripts.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=39&CA_ID=323,35,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
"“Just Sexy, Not Slutty”: Selfies, Sexualization, and the Boundary Making Practices among Female Social Media Users",Ting-Yu Kang,"selfies, sexualization, gender, social media, postfeminism, slut-shaming","This study explores how young women respond to the contradicting norms which regulate their production of selfies. On the one hand, it is an increasingly normative practice for young women to engage in self-sexualization on social media. On the other hand, the disciplinary gaze of slut shaming has continued to regulate women’s everyday expressions of sexuality. Based on semi-structured interviews, this study demonstrates how women develop various techniques of sexualization in order to respond to both norms, which reproduces rather than challenges the binary distinction between sluts and good women. Firstly, they tend to produce sexy photos with cultural capital cues, which serves to position their photos outside the social category of sluts. Secondly, de-sexualization is also a crucial technique. Photos are perceived as proper sexiness (i.e. not slutty) only when they are not considered linked to sexual desires.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=39&CA_ID=322,35,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Adolescent Gaming Motivations and Game Choices in Taiwan:“Temporarily Expanding the Boundaries of the Self”,Dai-Yun Wu,"role-playing game, media entertainment, gaming motivation, temporarily expanding boundaries of the self","Numerous views have been expounded regarding motivations for entertainment consumption in recent years. This study considered playing video games as a strategy for coping with daily stress and regulating physical and mental states, proposing that “temporarily expanding the boundaries of the self” is another gaming motivation. Data regarding teenagers from Taiwan’s National Communication Database indicated that “temporarily expanding the boundaries of the self” is the most predictive motivation for role-playing game behavior. Furthermore, the results revealed that game preferences reflect players’ gaming motivations, supporting the argument that playing video games is a coping strategy in daily life that helps people recover from stress and strain.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=39&CA_ID=321,35,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Data were obtained from the 2016 Taiwan Communication Survey (N = 2,098). The results indicate that communication inequality exists. People who have higher education and higher income are more likely to access both the television and Internet. Participants’ media use patterns may not reflect their sources of information on food risks. Compared with those using television as their information source, people who use the Internet as their source of information on food risks exhibit more prevention behaviors. People who use both the television and Internet as information sources are likely to perceive the severity of food risks and exhibit more prevention behaviors.

We identify four types of users. Nearly half of users who frequently express themselves are more likely to incidentally encounter political information on social media. Furthermore, the results indicate that incidental exposure to politics facilitates political talk but has limited effects on exposure to the number of online news outlets.

On the basis of framing theory, two distinctive types of knowledge are measured: game and substance knowledge. Frame analysis of 1,365 news stories in Taiwan’s four leading newspapers indicates that game frames were used more than substance frames in news about the student movement. A survey of 1,137 college students regarding their awareness and knowledge of the movement reveals that attention to student movement news was the strongest predictor of game knowledge, whereas elaboration of such news was significantly associated with substance knowledge. In addition, the results of the survey indicate that social media discussion was a stronger predictor of the level of game knowledge than interpersonal discussion, but interpersonal discussion had a greater effect on the acquisition of substance knowledge.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=40&CA_ID=331,36,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Ideotainment: The Duet of Politics and Popular Culture Under the Xi Jinping Regime,Yu-Hui Tai,"propaganda, popular culture, entertainment, idol, ideology, patriotism","The 40th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s Reform and Opening Policy occurred in 2018. The market economy has not pushed the CCP into democratization, and the one-party dictatorship system has remained. The ideology of the CCP has become the focus of scholars attempting to understand its ability to govern. This study analyzes the ideological policy of Xi Jinping’s regime, which places strong emphasis on the role of ideology and the “Chinese Dream” as the core of political thought. The research results indicate that the CCP has adopted the strategy of ideotainment, in which it combines ideology with the elements and platforms of popular culture, to achieve a presence in online entertainment and the daily life of young Chinese. With monopoly control of market access, the CCP co-opts numerous subjects into its ideological work, including market-oriented party media, semiofficial units, and private capital firms.

Reflections on the Sociology of Music: Reading Adorno’s Introduction to the Sociology of Music and DeNora’s Music in Everyday Life,Chun-Ming Huang,"mediation, cultural industry, everyday life, a technology of self, Adorno, sociology of music","This study reviews two influential texts in the sociology of music: Adorno’s Introduction to the Sociology of Music and DeNora’s Music in Everyday Life. In the former, Adorno regards music as social mediation, which not only can induce obedience but also enlighten and restructure people’s minds, whereas in the latter, DeNora conceptualises music as a technology of self—a means of accomplishing things. This study proposes that DeNora developed the thoughts of Adorno to acknowledge that music is a building material of consciousness and a mode of praxis and that individuals may use music to produce and structure their agency rather than to accompany the existing social order. The ideas of DeNora are considered a new direction in music sociology, with an ‘affective turn’ and a focus on everyday life. They return to the Adorno proposition but pay more attention to humanity’s search for social practice, agency, and hope.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=40&CA_ID=326,36,2019,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The practices of these subtitle groups feature organizational operation and distributive value. This study found that these subtitle groups operate in a loose manner and their material is distributed in accordance with the characteristics of a counter-canon. Such distribution not only compensates for the shortcomings of institutional art cinema but also promotes the success of the entire distribution network, this informal distribution strengthens the entire distribution network of art cinema.

Audience Commodity in the Age of Streaming Services: An Analysis of Netflix Binge-Watching and the Associated Audience Labor through Critical Political Economy of Communications (CEPC) Approach,Hui-Ju Tsai,,"This article explores the new explanation of audience commodity and Netflix viewers’ binge-watching practices by using the CEPC approach in the context of streaming services. Netflix is one of the most influential global streaming platforms. Netflix is not only changing how we watch TV but also fueling our binge-watching experience. Audience experiences have changed as television technologies have shifted from the linear scheduling/programming model to the curated content model. Platforms now allow a high level of personalization for each viewer. Netflix audiences can watch more TV programs under the curated content model than under the linear scheduling/programming model. In particular, Netflix viewers can enjoy watching TV programs without ads. Therefore, we examine if these viewers are not the audience commodity while Netflix revolutionized watching of movies and TV.

Revisiting the Background of Audience Commodity Theory in the History of the US Audiovisual Industry,Shih-Chien Chang,"US audiovisual industry, surplus value, advertising, audience commodity theory, audience labor","According to the materialist investigation of the US audiovisual industry, Dallas Smythe proposed the influential “audience commodity theory (ACT),” which is revisited in this article by analyzing industrial data. The current findings indicate that advertising revenue is insufficient to support content production and that the exclusive ad-support model is detrimental to the price discrimination of content, which is necessary for the modern audiovisual industry. This article proposes three limitations of the ACT: First, the so-called materialist analysis of ACT focuses on audiences’ activities only. Second, the effectiveness of advertising revenue may be exaggerated in the theory. Third, confusing the line between productive and unproductive processes leads to the blind spot of political economy analysis. Accordingly, this article concludes that ACT can focus on the productive activities of content production, particularly in new media, to improve its usefulness.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=339,37,2020,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
Whom Are News Bots “Laboring” for? Effects of Automated Journalism on Journalists,Chang-De Liu,"artificial intelligence, labor process, media workers, professionalism, algorithm","With the rapid development of artificial intelligence and algorithms, news bots and automated journalism have been introduced in news production, which has reshaped journalistic work since the mid-2010s. First, this paper describes the process of and the difficulties involved in introducing news bots into newsrooms in various countries. Second, the effects of automated journalism on journalistic labor, such as the effects on the skills, jobs, and autonomy in journalism, are examined from the perspective of the critical political economy of communication through labor process theory. Furthermore, this study presents how the discourse of automated journalism has been dominating or negotiating with traditional journalistic principles, such as objectivity and credibility. A discourse analysis on the differences between Taiwanese and Chinese related news articles shows that media representations in China, where media organizations enthusiastically introduce the automated journalism into the newsroom, are more inclined to emphasize the positive effects of news bots on journalists work and quality of news reports. In summary, this paper suggests a critical rethinking of news bots and automated journalism according to a review of various viewpoints and theories regarding the aforementioned emerging technologies.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=338,37,2020,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Construction and Challenges of Public Service Media: Drawing from Organizational Transformation Experience of Public Television in Japan and the United States,Yuan-Hui Hu,"NHK, public service media, public service broadcasting, dominant logic, organizational change, organizational technology","In this research, the transformation of public service media is examined from the perspective of organizational technology by drawing from the experiences of NHK in Japan and TPT and WTTW in the United States. The pace of organizational change in NHK is slower than that in TPT and WTTW. Currently, the dominant logic of NHK is to practice traditional broadcasting, and a strong sense of the need to evolve to a networked media logic is not evident. By contrast, the organizational changes at TPT and WTTW are active and vigorous. Management executives are highly aware of the necessity of transforming public service media to remain relevant in the digital age and are willing to achieve this transformation through organizational change. TPT and WTTW have designated specific departments to be in charge of digital media, and these departments are supported at par with the traditional television content production department. The distinct development trajectories of the organizational changes in Japan and the United States potentially reflect the differences in the social contexts within which public television organizations operate in the two countries.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=336,37,2020,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

The paper first briefly reviews the origins and nature of aging communication research. It then describes the problems that have been previously discussed by aging communication researchers, such as the problems related to the definition of the research subject, worldview of the researchers, and research design. Researchers in the field of aging communication are suggested to consider aging as a process of narrating life stories rather than a process of decay. People can adjust their lives by sharing stories regarding themselves, their families, or their colleagues in interactions. This paper suggests that positive attitudes should be adopted in aging communication research by borrowing reflective experiences from some subareas in psychology.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=335,37,2020,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
From Ontological Dualism to Ontology in Practice: An Actor-Network Turn of Mediatization,Pin-Cheng Chen,"dualism, mediation, actor-network theory, same sex marriage referendum, mediatization","Mediatization, as a theory that depicts the “-interrelated changes-” between media and the overall social and cultural domains, is always restricted to the ontological dualism framework. Accordingly, separating mediatization from the shadow of determinism or “media effects” is challenging. This study introduces actor-network theory to reinterpret mediatization theory and also proposes a new “media-concerned” approach. This new approach regards mediatization as the interrelated changes in a controversy during the assembling process of all the human and non-human actors, especially media. The approach is media decentralized but media concerned to avoid determinism or reductionism. To illustrate how this new approach applies empirically, I use the controversy over the 2018 Taiwanese referendum for marriage equality is as an illustrative case. I also consider the advantages and disadvantages of this new approach and provides directions for further theoretical and methodological discussion.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=42&CA_ID=351,38,2020,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Mediatized Communities: Exploring Taiwan’s Community Newspapers by Mediatization Theory,Shun-Shing Huang,"community newspapers, community media, mediatization, mediatized communities, journalism history","“Community” has been a keyword in the Taiwanese society and culture since the 1990s. The community empowerment, the reconstruction following the 921 Jiji earthquake, and even the revitalization of local communities are all closely related to the concept of community. Taiwan’s community media once thrived and played a role in transmitting information and consolidating community identity. However, unsustainable policies and the impact of new media continue to pose challenges to the form and meaning of community media. This article uses mediatization theory to examine the development of Taiwan’s community newspapers, analyze the structural factors behind their rise and fall, and consider how community newspapers can shape the vague and changeable concept of community and create a unique media culture.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=42&CA_ID=348,38,2020,Chinese Journal of Communication Research
The Wounded Healer: Illness Narratives of Physicians with Cancer,Huei-Chun Chi,"local knowledge, personal experience narrative, illness narrative, narrative analysis, voice","This study analyzed how physicians with cancer use their personal experience as narratives to evaluate and reflect on their own cancer treatment. Physicians use evidence-based medicine to employ a mutually exclusive framework that explains evidence-based medicine and local knowledge, and they regard local knowledge as unscientific or irrational. However, after receiving a diagnosis of cancer, physicians transition from the role of a doctor to that of a patient.

"The Problem is “De-Faced” News, not Fake News!：Rethinking how to Live with Fake News from the Levinas Perspective",Chih-Hsien Chen,"Levinas, fact-checking, ethics, fake news, the third, the face/visage","The primacy of the ethical relation to the Other proposed by Levinas may be an alternative strategy for managing the onslaught of fake news in today’s world. Instead of working on the levels of ontology and epistemology for fact-checking, Levinas prioritizes ethics and demands that communication be a response to the face of the Other, lest subjectivity become “de-faced.” Such a strategy may not only save people from becoming trapped in countless disputes surrounding fact-checking but also dispel the suspicion of a crackdown on freedom of speech. Journalistic practices of professionalism are proposed herein to be the best starting points from which to realize Levinas’s ideal encounters with various Others. This paper describes creative arrangements that can be made to transform the threat of fake news into an opportunity—that of approaching unfamiliar Others and institutionally sustaining ethical communication.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=43&CA_ID=359,39,2021,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This paper employs Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis to examine the different political tendencies of news outlets, ideological constructs, and social contexts. The findings suggest that newspapers initially tended to personalize the incident of Hou’s return but later uniformly criticized the Chinese Communist Party. This research compares the different discourses from Tangwai magazines and Hou’s autobiography and notes that mainstream newspapers avoided reporting political and ideological issues pertaining to the incident. Finally, Hou’s Chinese consciousness differs from the official nationalism and is indicative of the various national identities prevalent in the 1980s.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=43&CA_ID=355,39,2021,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

This study used the example of Henry David Thoreau’s Walden and its video game adaptation by Tracy Fullerton (Walden, a game) to analyze transmedia storytelling strategies. Walden, a game enables players to experience the life described in the original text, such as simulations of the facts that Thoreau build his cottage and collected berries. Furthermore, the game demonstrates how nature writing can be visualized and “audiolized.” Fullerton calculated the frequency of the species appearing in the text and combined this with her personal experience in visiting Walden Pond to present a historically and textually accurate natural environment for players to explore. Adapting nonfiction into video games requires in-depth research to accurately represent the original work and historical context.

Among the countries neighboring Taiwan, the Philippines has the most serious problem of journalists being killed. This study explored why Filipino journalists continue to be murdered. We found that, between 1986 and 2019, 165 Filipino journalists were killed while performing their duties, most of these were local journalists (95.2%). This study argues that these killings are enabled by the Filipino political structure of weak central democracy and strong local authority. Such a political structure enables local authorities to easily kill journalists, avoid accountability, and continue their family dynasty. The augment of this article is that, when the murder of local journalists becomes an effective means of silencing the press, the democratic crisis in the Philippines will worsen.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=44&CA_ID=368,40,2021,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

Tsai was also accused by Taiwanese media of trying to influence the 2018 elections. This research counted the number of likes on Facebook posts related to the incident. Posts portraying Tsai negatively received 27,000 likes. We then evaluated the influence of party identification and social distance on the first- and third-person perceptions of the incident by using an online survey. The results showed that pan green and neutral people thought the incident had a greater influence on people both in other counties and his own than on themselves.

The Soul and the Uncanny Media: On Kittler’s Media Theory,Wei-Yuan Chang,"discourse network, Kittler, media theory, psychoanalysis, soul, uncanny","In Friedrich Kittler’s media theory, “media” tend to transform people into their cultural prostheses. Although the cultural prostheses of people appear in different forms and function differently across historical periods, they all serve as auxiliary instruments that can enhance media sustainability, development, and evolution. This paper interprets this peculiar human–media relation by using the psychoanalytical concept of the “uncanny.” This paper conceptualizes Kittler’s writings on media history as an uncanny mythography of the media. Through this mythographic lens, the continuity among the three media discourse networks of the 1800s, 1900s, and 2000s is detected. This is an uncanny continuity in which people were constructed and used in the 1800s, torn down and devoured in 1900s, and finally abandoned in the 2000s, all at the hands of the media discourse networks.",http://cjctaiwan.org/issueArticle.asp?P_No=44&CA_ID=366,40,2021,Chinese Journal of Communication Research

First, Professor Pickard’s main argument is reconstructed in a condensed way, and the expanded public service media is concluded to provide a necessary, although insufficient, antidote to the United States’ over-commercialized and least regulated media system as compared with those of other rich and liberal democracies. Second, two crucial arguments that merit more attention are identified. The First Amendment may allow the state to actively strengthen press freedom. And the United States government’s active supports had been fundamental to subsidizing delivery systems for the American press and the transformation of post-war German and Japanese broadcasters into public service media. Finally, endnotes are provided that supplement and emphasize two critical facts: the most market-oriented FCC chairman did recognize the possibilities of market failure and proposed remedies accordingly, and America’s local governments have always given considerable subsidies to the publishing industry.

They have exploited a new situation arising since 2000, when the Nationalist Party that had ruled Taiwan since 1949 was defeated in the Presidential Election by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).

"Election Interpretation, Post-election Campaign, and Institutional Repair: The Case of the 2004 Legislature Council Elections in Hong Kong",LEE Lap Fung Francis,"institutional repair, election interpretations, post-election campaign, media discourse, public opinion","Critical media studies have generally considered the media as subservient to the existing power structure of a society. Because of the characteristics of the news production processes, the embedded-ness of the media in the political economic systems, and/or the working of the dominant ideology, the media tend to privilege the viewpoints and reinforce the legitimacy of the established institutions. But what is the relationship between the media and “established institutions” in a society experiencing political transition? This article examines this issue through a case study of post-election discursive contests. The victory of veteran activist Leung Kwok Hung (nicknamed Long Hair by the media) in the 2004 Legislative Council elections in Hong Kong was widely regarded as presenting a challenge to the establishment. How did the media report the election result? How did public discourse interpret the meanings and implications of his victory?

Social Discourse of Journalistic Professionalism in the Chinese Context,TONG Jingrong,"Professionalism, Chinese Journalism, Discourse, Media Reform, Chinese Society","This paper investigates the norms of journalistic professionalism in China, and its specific meanings, through the social construction approach. Journalistic professionalism is a normative value system as well as the occupational identity constructed for journalists in social discourse. It is argued that there are three social discourses of journalistic professionalism in China: institutional discourse, official discourse, and citizen discourse. Overlaps can be identified among the three discourses. Chinese journalistic professionalism is changing over time in the discursive field where power struggles take place. The media negotiates with contextual powers in expressing and practicing its professionalism. It is also argued that Chinese professionalism norms are endowed with context-specific meanings and understood in a way different from that in the western discourse. The same expressions for professional norms, such as “taking social responsibility,” “autonomy,” and “objectivity,” carry different implications in the contexts of China and Western countries.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=61&CA_ID=485,1,2007,Communication & Society

It explores the theoretical connections between the two dimensions and individuals’ political cognition, perceived media functions, and media use habits. A face-to-face sample survey was conducted in Foshan, Guangdong Province on 477 respondents. Major findings provide evidence for multiple dimensions of key concepts. Different patterns of political cognition, perceived media functions as well as media use variables relate to media literacy dimensions both directly and indirectly.

A Multicase Study Revisiting the Communicative Response Model,HUANG Yi-Hui,"crisis situation, communicative response model, media coverage, Taiwan, multiple case study","This study focuses on the relationships among crisis situations, crisis response strategies, and media coverage. The author examines four political crisis situations and the strategies used to manage them, adopts a comparative, multicase, holistic research design, uses typical content analysis procedures for data analysis, and applies pattern-matching logic to compare the data against a theoretical model, the corporate communicative response model. More than 1,220 news articles covering four political figures’ crises are examined. Results indicate that the use of denial in a commission situation, justification in a standards situation, and concession in an agreement situation increased positive media coverage. The results also suggest that for all but the agreement situation, a combination of crisis communication strategies was the most effective strategy to employ. This study has theoretical and practical implications for the symbolic approach in general and for crisis communicative responses in particular.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=61&CA_ID=483,1,2007,Communication & Society

Specifically, the article calls forth the following breakthroughs toward the development of this framework. First, avoid media centrism and communication essentialism by grasping the mutually embedded nature of state, market and society in the constitution of communication institutions and processes, Second, transcend simplistic dichotomies such as those between the “state” and the “market” and the “state” and “society” by analyzing the concrete articulations of power relationships among different social forces in Chinese communication, Third, overcome the rationalistic and cognitivist biases in much of the debate on the “public sphere” by drawing insights from both the political economy and cultural studies perspectives in Western critical communication research, and finally, reject any humanistic knee-jerk reaction against “tyrannical” states and “exploitative” capitalists by examining the specific patterns of communicative inclusion and exclusion enabled by the intersecting logics of the state and the market and by foregrounding the lived experiences and communicative needs of historically-located human subjects in an increasingly stratified Chinese society.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=62&CA_ID=494,2,2007,Communication & Society

Representing the Underprivileged: News Media Under Marketization and the Peasant-Migrant Labor Issue in Urban China,LI Yanhong,"media in mainland China, public representation of underprivileged group, media marketization, peasant-migrant labour","This study examines the relationship between news media under marketization and one emerging underprivileged group, the peasant-migrant labor group, in contemporary urban China. By analyzing four dailies’ coverage of the issue of detention and extradition of peasant-migrant workers in Guangzhou, it aims to enhance our understanding of the relationship between news media and underprivileged groups in transitional societies. The results of this study indicate that news media in contemporary China differ in their representation of different social groups’ interests: the more market-oriented newspapers are more active than the state-controlled news media in representing the peasant-migrant workers as revealed in its journalism practices and critical discourses. Market force is identified as essential in facilitating this new role of the market-oriented news media. However, the more market-oriented newspapers still fall short of representing the voice of the underprivileged.

The present study attempts to go beyond the previous studies by taking a micro-discoursal perspective. Adopting the theory of generic intertextuality in Critical Discourse Analysis, the study compares and contrasts the discursive construction of 268 newspaper advertisements in People’s Daily in 1980 and 2000. The study has revealed that 1) Although ads in both 1980 and 2000 belonged to the commercial public discourse, those in 1980 were inclined towards political discourse while those in 2000 tended to denote private discourse, 2) While the ads in 1980 were characterized largely by the informative style, the majority of the ads in 2000 manifested a hybridization of both the informative and the involving styles. A discussion of the changing advertising discourses in relation to the macro-social structures and the underlying ideologies in the past two decades of China is presented. It is hoped that the present study could contribute to the theoretical and methodological development of social-cultural studies as well as to the effort of quantifying intertextual analysis.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=62&CA_ID=489,2,2007,Communication & Society

Factors accounting for this apparent disjunction between journalists’ professionalism and overall media performance include the proliferation of journalism education, the entrenchment of press freedom in Hong Kong’s political culture, the journalists’ need for a selfdefense and survival strategy, and the media market as a balancing force of political pressure.

It also shows that negotiations over public opinion supervision between the party-state and the media with increasing autonomy have become increasingly legitimate.

Translocality and “Non-Locality”: Globalization and Chinese Blockbusters,Shaoyi SUN,"globalization, Chinese blockbusters, non-locality","Reviewing theories of globalization proposed by Anthony Giddens, John Tomlinson, and Arjun Appadurai, this article argues that, similar to the rise of Korean cinema and the global fascination with Japanese anime, the logic behind the cross-border production, distribution, and consumption of the socalled “Chinese blockbuster” follows what the author calls “the production of non-locality”. The term “non-locality” refers to those spatial signs that are not closely bound by specific culture and locality or have exhausted their original meanings bound by locality and culture. It also points to those “universal” themes or concerns that could possibly travel beyond national boundary. “Nonlocality” does not mean something that is non-existent, intangible or invisible. Rather, it refers to a locality that could be described as nameless, de-localized, and universalized. The characteristic of this “de-localized” locality lies in its “transportability”. To a certain degree, it still keeps its slippery and metaphorical relation with its origin, but more importantly, it is able to be “transported” to another culture and ready to be consumed.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=58&CA_ID=460,7,2009,Communication & Society
From Text Conversion to Cultural Translation: An Analysis of the Cause and Effect of Narration Strategy in Chinese Commercial Films,QI Lin,"Text Conversion, Cultural Translation, Values, Globalization","Transnational communication of Chinese commercial films can give us clues to understand the process of “Text Conversion and Cultural Translation”. “Text Conversion” is the process by which playwrights or directors transform fictions and historical stories into film scripts while “Cultural Translation” refers to the process in which film creators, considering audiences living in different cultural backgrounds, transform the original values of the cultural texts into a new form recognizable by the audiences. Through the analysis of films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero, we can see that the effectiveness of transnational communication of Chinese films is determined by the accuracy of the “Cultural Translation” while the quality of “Cultural Translation” is determined by the awareness of cultural identity of the film creator himself. Effectiveness is also influenced by contemporary political and economical conditions.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=58&CA_ID=459,7,2009,Communication & Society
The Reception of Trans-border Chinese Commercial Movies,LING Yan,"Trans-border Chinese commercial film, the imagination of China, grassroots audience","In recent years, almost every trans-border Chinese commercial movie has plunged into the vicious cycle of being popular but at the same time heavily criticized by the general public. With many angles to this issue, I think that the role of the audience in making sense of the movies cannot be ignored. This article tries to discuss the complicated ways in which the audiences are interpreting these trans-border Chinese movies. The study finds that transborder Chinese movies are closely relevant to the imagination of China in the process of globalization and industrialization. To a large extent, criticism of trans-border Chinese movies is a reflection of the dissatisfaction of the imagination of China in the movies. At the same time, the excessive criticism of these films is also relevant to the identification and expression of grassroots Chinese audiences.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=58&CA_ID=458,7,2009,Communication & Society

The Way Out for the Education of Journalism and Communication in China — Analysis on Experts Advice and Renovation Path,DU Jun Fei,"journalism and communication, education, advice surveying, path of renovation","This thesis provides an analysis of the status quo and the future of education in journalism and communication in China. Based on systematic data gathered through interviews with experts in the field, the author attempts to discover to what extent the operating system is accepted by the education sector, and consequently discusses the practical significance of the 22 given propositions and the possible path of educational renovation. Surveying and discussion data point to the conclusion that there is a large-scale systematic crisis in Chinese journalism and communication education, affecting material conditions, educational philosophy and teaching methods. Meanwhile, some systematic improvement is also possible. This dilemma of education is rooted in outdated management philosophy and the confusion of internal boundaries within the discipline. This thesis differentiates multifarious tasks of journalism and communication education in detail. In terms of the division and functions of first, second and third disciplines, it also provides strategy and resolution based on the foregoing conclusion.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=58&CA_ID=456,7,2009,Communication & Society
NGO’s Media Agenda Building under State Control: The Case of China,ZENG Fanxu,"media strategies, media agenda building, NGO, social movement, civil society","This article examines two cases: APP’s deforestation in Yunnan and the Yuanmingyuan plastic membrane project to describe the process of media agenda building by ENGOs in China. The study shows that an NGO may successfully build an institution-challenging media agenda, gain media access, and influence the media frame if it devises a set of flexible media strategies. This paper concludes that media is an important political resource for NGOs to gain legitimacy and to expand their autonomy in China. Through the case studies, the article examines the seeming paradox of state-challenging NGO issues appearing in Chinese media when it is still strictly controlled by the state. How are these media agendas built through the interaction between NGO and media? What are some of the implications of these interactions for civil society developing in China? In a broad sense, this article illustrates not only NGO strategy in building media agendas, but also the logic of Chinese media reporting on, or as part of, those agendas. These phenomena are very important for us to understand the change of the relation between the NGO (civil society), media, and political institutions in such a post-totalist society.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=57&CA_ID=454,8,2009,Communication & Society

Why should we study them? What are their conceptual origins? How significant are they in today’s Chinese societies? What conceptual and methodological issues do they entail? As researchers, how should we meet the challenge of studying new media events? Can we seize the opportunities they offer to enhance Chinese communication research and even studies on communication and history as a whole? This foreword to the “new media events” special issue provides an overview of the above questions. We start from Dayan and Katz’s theoretical framework of “media events” and go beyond it to consider the latest changes in Chinese media, especially recent developments based on networked new media technologies as well as the incessant “new media events” that have unfolded in recent years. From a macroscopic angle, we identify key problems regarding communication technology, social structure, and the making of history in order to prepare readers for more in-depth analysis in the various articles of this special issue. These include crucial topics such as discursive rights, the public / private boundary, media system, and social consequences. We also attempt to delineate the definition and categorization of new media events, while stressing a “contemporary-history perspective on communication studies” that needs further development in future research.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=56&CA_ID=446,9,2009,Communication & Society
Of Sympathy and Play: Emotional Mobilization in Online Collective Action,YANG Guobin,"Internet incidents, social movement, cultural analysis, emotional mobilization","Internet incidents are a new form of collective action. They are an integral part of the countermovement against the “great transformation” in contemporary China. This article analyzes the mobilization of internet incidents from the perspective of cultural analysis in social movement theory. It argues that the mobilization of internet incidents depends on those expressive forms and content that may produce among internet users such emotional responses as joy, laughter, anger, sadness and sympathy. The occurrence of internet incidents is thus a process of emotional mobilization. This article reveals two styles of emotional mobilization through two case studies. The incident known as “A Bloody Case Triggered by a Bun” represents a humorous style of emotional mobilization and is typical of internet incidents involving cultural issues. The other incident, known as the “Shanxi black kiln” case, represents mobilization that appeals to the sentiments of sadness and sympathy, most often seen in cases involving various types of social injustices.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=56&CA_ID=445,9,2009,Communication & Society

In addition, this article demonstrates that different parties of social political practices — netizens, media, government, and social / business institution — are gambling with public opinion discourse by refuting each other at one time and supporting each other at another time.

Paradigm Defining Events and the Logic of Routinization: The Case of Hong Kong Newspapers’ Coverage of YouTube Video Clips,Francis L. F. LEE,"YouTube, paradigm-defining events, routinization, media loops","In a relatively open society with a mature media system, the formation and evolution of new media events are heavily influenced by reactions from and intervention by mainstream media. With this premise, this article examines the relationship and interaction between the new media and mainstream media in Hong Kong. This article argues that the impact and challenges of new media on conventional media are often manifested during and through the occurrence of paradigm-defining events, whereas the mainstream media would tend to respond to challenges through paradigm repair and establishment of new routines. Successful paradigm repair allows the mainstream media to absorb, at least temporarily, the impact brought about by new media. Similar new media events thus would not happen frequently, or their scale and prominence would be reduced to a minimum. Empirically, this article reviews Hong Kong newspapers’ coverage of various events generated by YouTube video clips from 2006 to 2009. The analysis illustrates the major conceptual argumentsexplicated in the article. It also illustrates various characteristics of the new media events generated through the interaction between new and conventional media, such as the formation of media loops and the significance of responses from social organizations.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=56&CA_ID=440,9,2009,Communication & Society
The Relationship Between the Form and the Content of Video Game,Meily M. F. CHEUNG,"video game, medium, form, content, bias","Video gaming is currently one of the most popular forms of entertainment. Most studies on videogaming have focused on examining the content, but little attention has been given to the form of the medium. In fact, some scholars note that the content of a medium is strongly related to its form. This study explores the connection between the form and the content of video game through a medium perspective. Medium theorists share the assumption that the medium itself brings impact to human experience and interaction. The forms of a medium create, select, modify the content which the medium carries and transmits. Through in-depth interviews with game producers, designers and experts from Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the study reveals how the form of video game shapes the content. There are also norms and common practices within the industry in selecting, defining and presenting content in order to fit the requirements of the medium.

Through a survey of 480 rural residents in a typical central China province, this study supports the central role of knowledge in the adoption process. Results show that the low adoption rate of the Internet in rural China is directly caused by people’s low levels of knowledge about the Internet. Although attitude is positively influenced by knowledge, the former plays a weaker role than the latter in rural residents’ adoption of the Internet. This is why people with minimum Internet knowledge would not adopt the Internet even if they have a relatively positive attitude toward it. In addition, this study has supported the contributing effects of mass media use on the acquisition of Internet knowledge.

Such selective interpretation has revealed another kind of discourse bias: discourses of others consistent with the in-group are always chosen for in-group expression in order to maintain the group face. Defending self-image and seeking approval of others must be carried out in relations based on the perception of the specific linguistic and non-linguistic context, cultural values, and ideology of others.

Message desirability was determined by voters’ party affiliations and the candidate under attack. An analysis on the responses from 829 randomly-sampled participants revealed that when participants saw their own candidates attacked, they reported they were not very influenced, but they said others would be. This third-person differential disappeared when they saw an attack on the candidate they disliked. Although the third-person effect did not have influence on the intentions to discuss negative presidential election news with others, a significant relationship existed between banning negative presidential election news and third-person perception level. In addition, the third-person differential was positively associated with the likelihood to vote and negatively associated with the likelihood to change voting decisions, which expands third-person behavioral domains beyond censorship issues.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=54&CA_ID=427,11,2010,Communication & Society

In Hong Kong, a major source of public concern comes from the conflict between press claims of service to public interest and readers’ perception of the contrary. This research measures local press performance in terms of practice and functions by employing six bipolar dimensional scales: 1) informing-entertaining, 2) factual-interpretive, 3) local-cosmopolitan, 4) focused-diversified, 5) watchdog-boosterism, and 6) advocacy-professionalism. A large-scale content analysis of all 14 newspapers currently in circulation in Hong Kong was conducted and 27,797 news stories were content analyzed. Findings show that: 1) local newspapers differ in topics covered, approaches and styles in reporting, 2) presence of subjective wordings in news headlines is common in all newspapers, and 3) the general belief that news helps to inform the public and monitor power is not clearly evident in the analysis.

"Exploring Agenda Diversity in Local, National, and Foreign News on Hong Kong Television","Wan Ying LIN, Francis L. F.

Whether various news outlets in a society set the same or different agendas would have important empirical and normative implications. This paper thus uses agenda diversity as the conceptual focus to examine the characteristics of television news in Hong Kong. The constructs differentiate between internal and external diversity, as well as daily level and aggregate level diversity. They then compares agenda diversity of local, national and foreign news on three television stations. The results show that when compared to national and local news, foreign news has higher degrees of daily agenda diversity on Hong Kong television. The degree of diversity in foreign news reporting, however, is reduced to a larger extent when the daily agendas are aggregated. As a result, foreign news has lower degrees of agenda diversity at the aggregate level.

Linkage politics in Chinese TV foreign news: A Study of Xinwen Lianbo of CCTV,ZHOU Baohua,"linkage politics, foreign news, Chinese television, CCTV, Xinwen Lianbo","News is classified as domestic or foreign by whether news events occur inside or beyond national boundaries. The two types of news are often studied separately, and researchers seldom explore how domestic and foreign news are related to each other. This paper applies the concept of “linkage politics” to explore the interconnection between the inside and the outside within the context of foreign news production in post-reform China. Based on a content analysis of CCTV newscasts, this paper argues that the party-state power harnesses foreign news for domestic purposes by a number of operational strategies, such as self-prioritization, setting foreign news as comparison, and minimization of “sensitive” news. These strategies are aimed at legitimizing the existing political institution and facilitating internal cohesion. The findings will be discussed in relation to the context of China’s social as well as media reform, which is characterized by a form of marketized authoritarianism.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=52&CA_ID=412,13,2010,Communication & Society

Broadcasting Foreign TV News Between Control and Plurality: The Case of Singapore,XU Xiaoge,"foreign TV news, news flow, topics, broadcast enhancements","Television news in Singapore has been largely redundant due to government’s multilingualism and nation building efforts as well as its heavy control. But with increasing globalization and diversification of its population, have such duplication and redundancy been changed at least in foreign TV news coverage? Through a comparative content analysis of foreign TV news coverage by an English-language channel and a Chinese-language channel over one constructed month, this study examined foreign TV news flow, topics and enhancements. The results show that both channels provide more or less the same amount of foreign TV news while differing in terms of which country or region the stories originated from. When it comes to topics covered by both channels, they do not differ too much from each other. What sets them apart, however, is their emphasis. English-language channels emphasizes coverage of sports while Chinese-language channels emphasize reports of internal politics in a foreign country. The examination of broadcast enhancements shows that the Chinese channel tends to use far more pictures and texts than its English counterpart. The results show that as long as they do not touch on sensitive topics such as politics, religions, racial or cultural issues, different language channels can differ in news flow direction, topical emphasis and broadcast enhancements.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=52&CA_ID=409,13,2010,Communication & Society
Banal Global Imagination: Multi-nation Stories and International Organizations in Television Foreign News,Francis L. F. LEE,"banal global imagination, multi-nation stories, international organization, foreign news, comparative analysis","The process of globalization has led to increasing interconnectedness between different parts of the worlds. But to what extent and in what ways does television foreign news reflect this reality of globalization? This article employs the concept of “banal global imagination” as an entry point to tackle the question. The emphasis is on whether and how globalization has become the basic assumption behind news contents. More concretely, this study examines multi-nation stories and international organizations in television foreign news. An analysis of television news of 16 countries shows that the percentage of multi-nation stories and international organization stories remains low. It shows that globalization has yet to become a basic assumption behind much of news contents. At the same time, there is no relationship between country characteristics and the extent of multi-nation/international organization stories in television news. In contrast, at the level of television station, we find that television stations with more foreign correspondents, stations less reliant on advertising revenue, and stations in more diverse media systems are more likely to cover more multi-nation stories and international organization stories. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=52&CA_ID=408,13,2010,Communication & Society

The Rhetorical Construction of “the Will of Heaven”: The Method of Heavenification in the Yizhuan,Xiaosui XIAO,"analogue method, heavenification, rhetorical construction, religious communication, The Book of Changes","A perplexing but ignored question concerning the pervasion of divination and fortune-telling in Chinese societies is how the diviners are able to convince people that they have actual access to the secret of Heaven. Their success is explained in this essay by examining how the diviners strategically make use of a procedure that appears to be in accordance with the course of Heaven, called “heavenification,” (擬天手法) to build apparent connections with Heaven. Heavenification is a complex process of rhetoric. There are, in theory, infinite ways in which Heaven and human beings can be compared. What specific parallels should be drawn for the benefit of the diviners to establish communication with Heaven and, more importantly, to persuade other people to accept this communication is not an easy decision. The diviners have to take into consideration not only their contemporaries’ understanding of the concept of Heaven but also their expectation of what the will of Heaven might appear to be at the time. The book of changes, or Zhouyi (《周易》), accepted for thousands of years as the key to the mystery of transformation, is a classic example of this rhetorical construction. This essay analyzes the method of heavenification used in Yizhuan, the Commentaries appended to Zhouyi. The analysis shows that the commentators have systematically interpreted Zhouyi and established a legendary status for it as a book “containing the measure of heaven and earth,” thus legitimizing its position in predicting and explaining the will of Heaven in China.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=50&CA_ID=401,14,2010,Communication & Society

Sounding the Image: Between Visuality and Orality,"Helen GRACE, Shing AU-YEUNG",,"This article and the accompanying image set are part of an on-going study of camera phone photography in Hong Kong. The case study discussed here outlines an everyday and relatively casual image-making practice by a camera phone user who is a professional illustrator. Camera phone photos, due to their hyper-production and seemingly ephemeral nature, are often regarded as insignificant in themselves, and their aesthetic/affective features are often overlooked. Previous camera phone studies have focused on the human-computer interaction (HCI) aspect, but not on the user-created content itself. Our case studies, on the other hand, adopt a micro-level close reading and ethnographical perspective, focusing on the users’ image-making practices and the meaning of the images in themselves. In this article, through an in-depth interview with the user, we uncovered the circumstances of the images’ production, registering additional information from an oral account of the images, including the user’s feelings and sentiments, the rhythm of life, and the use of a common aesthetic framework, based around colloquial expressions such as mouh liuh, dāk yi and leng. Because the meaning of such images cannot be read from an objective observation of the images or from formal considerations alone, our research problematizes the notion of the universal communicability of visual language. We also find that users apply deliberate and sober aesthetic choices and judgments in taking camera phone photos by interacting with mechanic capabilities in a closely collaborative manner. At the same time, the presence of photographic themes such as light, shadows and reflections can be seen as a connection to very early photographic practices, refreshed within the contemporary regime of the technical image. The research suggests that visuality cannot be separated from orality in understanding everyday image practices within a generalized aesthetic sense we are calling general aesthesia.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=50&CA_ID=398,14,2010,Communication & Society

Information is an important and useful reference to eliminate uncertainties arising from technological risks. The government, as an authoritative source of information in risk governance, has a predominance of defining risk in the society. In the communicative process, however, the government either greatly depends on technological experts’ opinions or makes its own decisions arbitrarily. The voices of lay people are often excluded. The public is suspicious of risk information as interpreted by the government. In order to shorten the perceptional gap between the government and the public, a great, transparent, and participatory mechanism in risk communication in society is needed.

Sociologists coined the term “risk society” to capture the endless risks faced by human beings.

Social risk consciousness, however, is not essentially tied with the accountability of social institutions, owing to discursive contestation in the public discourse.

This paper attempts to show how Chinese society defines the relationship between AIDS and the general public through representing the disease in mass media. News discourse is especially effective in this aspect. The discussion on AIDS in China can be generalized as having three levels of discourse: the government’s view that sets the commonly held values, news discourse, and the public opinions. News discourse, as the main primary information source to ordinary people, can be influential to the government’s policies on AIDS. This paper summarizes the process of news reporting shifting from keeping pace with the overall feeling of the nation to questioning it. Considering AIDS as something that affects national development, news discourse is supposed to have influenced the government policies on AIDS.

Finally, 15 Taiwanese females with aesthetic surgery experience were recruited and voluntarily participated in this study. Their average age was 32.1 (SD = 11.6). The findings show that participants tend to obtain information about aesthetic surgery from friends and the internet, followed by medical practitioners (e.g., physicians and nurses). Participants indicate that friends tend to enthusiastically share their experience with them and therefore become one of their credible sources. Additionally, some participants obtain information in relation to aesthetic surgery via the internet because the internet is accessible, interactive, and the like. As to medical practitioners, they are ranked as important information sources among participants, but they are also regarded as one of the less credible sources among various channels. In their minds, participants feel that medical practitioners with expertise over-emphasize the efficacy of aesthetic surgery in order to earn more money.

We also retrieved articles from the foreign press in China, major British and American newspapers, and Chinese official documents and publications.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=47&CA_ID=377,17,2011,Communication & Society

Local Audiences in the Age of Global Communication,Georgette WANG,"media globalization, transnational television, audience studies, cultural proximity, cultural imperialism","The literature on media and globalization has in the past been dominated by two groups of studies: those that focus on the hegemony of transnational media, and those that emphasize the determining influence of cultural discount and cultural proximity in audience preferences. The former emphasize the growing dominance of Hollywood products, in these studies, audiences are seen as scattered, local and passive. The latter, on the other hand, focus on the origin of a program as the key determinant of audience preference. When media products no longer flow “from the West to the rest,” it is time for us to ask: indeed, to what extent do we know about the audience in this age of media globalization?",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=46&CA_ID=374,18,2011,Communication & Society

Embarrassment of the 3S Girls towards Marriage in Contemporary Urban China: A Case Study of the TV Series Senior Girl Must Marry,Lei WANG,"3S girls, spouse-choosing scale, marriage squeeze","This paper makes a scientific social analysis of the contemporary 3S (single, seventies, and stuck) girls in Chinese urban areas in terms of their embarrassment about and dilemma with marriage, by means of a case study of the TV series Senior Girl Must Marry, which has been hotly broadcasted in mainland China. We focus on these two questions: first, what is the cause of the 3S girls’ dilemma with marriage, and second, what is the gap between the TV script and China’s social reality? This research aims at finding the root reason why these excellent 3S girls in China have so much trouble finding a good marriage by analyzing the TV series. Based on sociology’s “spousechoosing scale theory” and “social exchange theory,” together with text analysis and a survey of the Chinese TV audience, this paper probes into the history of the traditional marriage pattern that has existed in China for the last 2,000 years, in which the man usually occupies a superior and advantageous position over the woman, from the perspective of social culture. This long-existing marriage pattern has led to differences between men and women in standards of choosing spouses. This paper argues that this “imbalance of marriage structure” should be attributed to the inequality between men and women in choosing spouses. The phenomenon of “3S girls” ultimately reflects the patriarchal concept and the inequality of men and women in China. Therefore, traditional marriage and spouse-choosing patterns must be changed before the problem of 3S girls can be solved. That is to say, the concept that males are superior to and enjoy a higher status than females must be changed, and at the same time the social division of labor, which confines Chinese women to the household, must also be changed. In this way, Chinese women will enjoy higher economic and political status and thus become equal in choosing spouses.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=45&CA_ID=363,19,2012,Communication & Society

Recognizing that innovation is impossible without researcher’s commitment to creativity, he also talks about how innovation can be brought into each stage of the research process, ranging from the formulation of research questions to report writing. To Chan, comparison is the keystone of social science research. He explains how a researcher can benefit from a comparative perspective and how comparative communication has been coming of age.

The Politics of Recognition and Discourse Order in Social Movement: Media Interpretation of the “Walking” Event in Xiamen,Yueqin HUANG,"social movement, recognition politics, dicourse order, ideology, media text","Social movements in contemporary China are unconventional and marginal political struggles with possibilities and spaces for multiple interpretations in discourse practice. This paper uses the Xiamen’s “walking” event as a case study. From the perspective of theory of political recognition, we discuss the discourse order and politics of representation in this environmental risk movement. Study shows that conflicts and diversities appeared in local media regarding the positions, discourses, and ideologies on the construction of the “walking” event. The local media in Xiamen, in assuming its advocacy role, belittles its objectives and significance. The network media is meant to open up an alternative space tit for tat. Some non-local and market-oriented media used strategic narratives and local imagination of “civil society” to dispel the negative political labels of official discourse and recreate the subject image of public participants and the meaning of the “walking” event. This challenges the dominant ideology and temporarily creates a new order of discourse. This paper points out that Xiamen’s “walking” event and the official discourse are a synthesis of power relations of “bad recognition” and “bad distribution.” The discourse practice of public participants and non-local media is a political struggle for recognition. Its core lies in the struggle for legitimacy, the recognition of civil rights, and equal social participation.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=44&CA_ID=355,20,2012,Communication & Society

Toward a Chi/Qi Theory of Communication: An East-West Dialogue,"Jensen CHUNG, May HO","chi, shih, chi communication theory, dialectics, energy flow","The theory of “chi communication” is an emerging theory built on an old Chinese philosophy. It is based on the concept of yin-yang dualism stemming from principles of I-Ching (also spelled as Yi Jing), The Book of Change. This paper advances the theory by putting forward eight basic principles of chi theory and making eight corresponding assumptions. To explore what the new theory can contribute to communication studies, this study compares the theory with three relevant Western communication theories. Employing Lao Tze’s tenet in Dao De Jing, chi is defined as perceived vital energy resulting from the interplay between opposite yin and yang attributes. The chi of communication is the perceived vitality resulting from interplays between opposites in communication elements. The characteristics of yin and yang in messages constitute a shih, propensity or a strategic advantage. Communication can facilitate the shih by adjusting the distance between yin and yang to generate either a drastic chi or a mild chi depending on the communication purpose.

Shanghai’s Public Screen Culture: Local and Coeval,Chris BERRY,"screens, Shanghai, public culture, globalization, walking words","Electronic moving image screens of varying sizes have proliferated in public space all over the world during the past decade and more. The same technology is potentially available to be installed anywhere. So, are there any local patterns to the uptake of this technology, or are they just part of the generic city? This essay explores public screen culture in Shanghai to argue that local specificity does manifest itself in a variety of ways. First, different patterns emerge according to the type of place in which the screens are installed and the singularity of the site itself. For example, the primary function of screens in transport hubs such as the Shanghai South Railway Station is to direct flows of people through the space, screens in the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum mediate the visitor’s experience of the exhibits, and in the Wujiaochang retail hub they not only advertise products and stores but also act as part of a “lightscape” of enchantment that helps to attract visitors. In each case, the individual circumstances of the site and those who frequent it create further local specificity. Second, Shanghai is also marked by very heavy usage of tickertape-style “walking word” (走字) screens and other text-based electronicscreens at the entrances to shops, residential quarters (小區), and even buses. Such screens are relatively rare in London or Cairo. This prevalence can be related to a much longer culture of using characters (字) as a way of marking liminal spaces between inside and outside. Such practices go back to the dynastic era but, in the People’s Republic, they also include the more recent blackboard culture. While these antecedents create a genealogy, the changeover to electronic text-based screens is also part of a larger cultural transformation with the emergence of the market economy in the People’s Republic and an associated aspirational culture. Taken as a whole, the essay concludes by arguing that these two types of local specificity open up the question of whether they manifest not so much “glocal” adaptation of an established Western or metropolitan usage but rather coeval development of the usage of new media under conditions of rapid global uptake.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=43&CA_ID=349,21,2012,Communication & Society

"Urban Screens, Networked Cultures, and Participatory Public Space",Scott MCQUIRE,"urban screens, public space, media theory, geomedia, participation","As contemporary cities become environments supporting increasing media density, it is important to reexamine our understanding of the dynamics of public space. The transformation of media into geo-media, characterized by ubiquitous networks coupled to context-sensitive information, means that urban space is now subject to new geometries of power and opened to new forms of agency. Large-scale public screens are both one of the most visible signs of this trajectory, and a strategic site for its analysis. While the urban screenscape has often inspired futuristic cinematic scenarios, such as the dystopic city of Blade Runner (1982), the forms of spectatorship and social practice incubated by urban screens in fact differ significantly from those associated with cinema. Moreover, in a digital networked culture, urban screens have gained the potential to move beyond “ambient television” to play a more proactive role in initiating new collective interactions in public space. Drawing on the approaches and projects developed around several different sites for urban screens, this paper will examine the potential for urban screens to facilitate new modes of participation in the public spaces of networked cultures.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=43&CA_ID=346,21,2012,Communication & Society
"The Stoa, Large Screens, and Aesthetic Cosmopolitanism",Nikos PAPASTERGIADIS,"public space, cosmopolitanism, contemporary art, dialogue","The stoa and the large screen are taken in this essay as ancient and contemporary topoi for cosmopolitan encounters. Cosmopolitanism is the product of an idea of the world and an ideal form of global citizenship. Everyone who is committed to it recalls the phrase first used by Socrates and then adopted as a motif by the Cynics and the Stoics: “I am a citizen of the world.” Indeed, the etymology of the word and its theory appear to be in wondrous symmetry. Throughout history, cosmopolitanism has continuously surfaced as a concept that addresses the meaning of the subject at both the core of being and the widest spheres of belonging. It can be traced back to the mythological fascination with the abyss of the void and the infinite cosmos, as well as the recurring in the philosophical debates about the relationship between individual freedom and universal rights. I will argue that the need to give form—to make a world—out of these extremities is a persistent feature of critical imagination and that its contemporary manifestations are more clearly grasped through the concept of aesthetic cosmopolitanism. This general claim about aesthetic cosmopolitanism is grounded in the observation of the current tendencies to generate a dialogue between global issues and local experiences in contemporary art, and is subsequently developed through a reframing of the debates over the function of the imagination within aesthetics and politics. At the heart of this essay are key examples of artistic practices that explore the issues of belonging, hospitality and cosmopolitanism.

Most people explained this as Google’s bypassing Chinese regulators for uncensored simplified Chinese search results. However, from the perspective of media and communication geographies, this event implies a specific function for the geopolitical location of Hong Kong in that a new media enterprise can use it to resolve a business crisis. This paper concerns the issue of interactions between geopolitical places and media. From the approach of media and communication geographies, this issue is related to a wide range of “spatial turns” or “geographic turns” in media and communication studies. The paper first provides a brief introduction and review of the newly developed subject of media and communication geographies, as well as the labor division between geographers and researchers in media and communication studies. Next, the paper indicates that geopolitical areas within the boundaries of a country are regarded as a type of place for media research about how the state government can make use of national media for the governance of sensitive geopolitical areas in reality.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=43&CA_ID=344,21,2012,Communication & Society

"Institutional Capital, Non-institutional Capital and Media coverage of Social Issues: Taking Four Environmental Events for Examples","Qian-Fang, XIA Guang-Feng, YUAN Ke CHEN","institutional social capital, non-institutional social capital, conflict issues, media coverage, opportunities in cracks","Four environmental events were investigated with regard to the logic mechanism of social issues’ media coverage from the perspective of Social Capital Theory. We divide social capital into “institutional social capital” and “non-institutional social capital” in accordance with China’s own experiences. In general, institutional capital, which dominates the obstruction of conflict issues’ exposure, plays a pivotal role in media coverage. However, institutional capital is also able to prevent risks for media reports by using the so-called higher authorities’ pressure from the administrative level, and the official discourse in a legality sense, etc., and possibly assists the issues breaking through regional limitations and molding public opinion, which will finally lead to the settling down of events. On the other hand, non-institutional capital operates through unstructured relationship networks in social space, and is based on disruption within the regime, the release of social space, and the professionalism orientation of the media, etc. In the absence of institutional capital, if noninstitutional capital public by the possessed was powerful enough, and their strategies could effectively link to institutional capital, they would be able to gain media exposure. This explains the expediency and fragmentation of the Chinese journalistic professionalism to a large extent.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=42&CA_ID=342,22,2012,Communication & Society

Using the Dialogue Theory of Public Relations (DTPR) as a framework, this study explores the extent to which social media is employed by corporate organizations during crisis events. The three research questions presented for examination are: (1) How do the corporate organizations communicate with the public on official websites and social media?, (2) Does the use of social media fit the suggestions of the DTPR?, and, (3) What are the relationships between social media use and industrial category, crisis type, and crisis response speed? Data were collected in two stages. Firstly, information about crisis events was collected by observing the three most-read online news sites in Taiwan. The collection period was from April 1, 2010 to September 30, 2010, on a daily basis. Secondly, after crisis events were discovered in news coverage, corporate responses were observed on official websites and social media.

An Internet-based study was conducted in Taiwan between December 24, 2009 and January 31, 2010. 662 respondents completed the questionnaire on the Internet. The results showed that optimistic bias existed amongst the sample. Optimistic bias and self-efficacy significantly and negatively predicted intentions to receive the H1N1 vaccine, while social trust significantly and positively predicted such intentions. This study suggests that the Taiwanese government needs to reduce the phenomenon of optimistic bias and unrealistic self-efficacy, reinforce social trust, and foster effective communication of information about health, in order to improve intentions to receive the H1N1 vaccine. In particular, this study finds that social trust is one of the most important determinants of intentions to receive the H1N1 vaccine. Social trust is not easy to establish, but it is easy to lose. In order to establish social trust, government and public health professionals need to pay more attention to health risk communication. A work team, taking care of public education about health risks, must engage in health and risk communication, and develop effective health and risk communication campaigns as an epidemic breaks out. By doing so, people will get a chance to understand more about epidemics, and misunderstandings will be eliminated among medical and public health professionals, as well as lay people.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=42&CA_ID=339,22,2012,Communication & Society
Should I Stay or should I Go? A Study of Relationships of Human Capital and Social Learning with Intentions to Leave in Public Relations,Yi-Ning Katherine CHEN Abstract,"human capital, intent to leave, professional attributes, public relations practitioners, social learning theory","This study investigated 150 public relations practitioners to examine the relationships among human capital, job attributes, career commitment, and intentions to leave the profession in Taiwan. The findings indicate that people with more education are less likely to leave the profession for compensation, growth and advancement, social status, or a friendly work place. Years worked in the profession negatively predict leaving for growth and advancement or a friendly work place. Working hours per week positively predict leaving for more flexible working hours. People who place a high value on their influence at work are less likely to leave for compensation, but more likely to leave for growth and advancement. Work-life balance negatively predicts leaving for compensation and status. However, people who value job prestige are more likely to leave for compensation and status. Career commitment negatively predicts leaving the profession for compensation, status, or a friendly workplace. People with stronger commitment also have less intention to leave. Taken together, social learning on job variables better predicts reasons to leave and intentions to leave than do human capital variables.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=42&CA_ID=338,22,2012,Communication & Society

Chinese academic journals operate within the orbit of the danwei system. The autonomy of the publishing field is undermined both by exogenous and endogenous factors. On the one hand, journals are vulnerable to economic and political concerns. Theoretical propaganda and selfcensorship in the editorial room ensure political correctness, while rent-seeking activities establish a “web of subsidies” for underfunded journals. On the other hand, the danwei affiliation and the monopolization of editorial power create various opportunities for the operation of social guanxi and lead to a multi-layer particularism.

Combining a close reading of the popular drama and vast numbers of online commentaries and paying particular attention to the articulation between the text and the sociopolitical context, this paper argues that Snail House provides ample evidence of how corruption has been redefined and reframed by collective imaginations of “the world of officialdom” (guangchang) and neoliberal thinking and rationality.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=48&CA_ID=384,23,2013,Communication & Society
Comparing Media System,"Daniel HALLIN, Joseph M. CHAN",,"Daniel Hallin, the coauthor of Comparing Media Systems: Three Models of Media and Politics, in response to a question on the generalizability of the models identified in the book, maintains they are not intended to be universal. Rather, they are abstracted from specific contexts in various European and American countries. For him, the key to comparative study is contextualization. He advises comparative communication researchers to treat the concepts in the book as reference points and to formulate frameworks based on the context they are studying. On the choice between small-N and large-N studies in comparative studies, Hallin observes that the state of comparative communication research has not reached the point where fruitful statistical studies can be done. On the contrary, the small-N case study approach can generate the deep understanding of media systems that the field badly needs. When asked how the Chinese media system may fit the models he has identified in his book, Hallin argues that China should be conceptualized on its own because of its special logic. However, he argues that the comparative dimensions he used in his analysis—the structure of media markets, the role of the State, the forms of “political parallelism” and journalistic professionalism— may have their equivalents in China and elsewhere, and they should be analytically relevant. To Hallin, the days are over when anyone could study a single national media system in isolation, comparative communication research has come of age in this globalizing world.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=336,24,2013,Communication & Society
"Social Transformation, Media Interactions, and the Historical Development of Audience Participation Radio Talk Shows in Hong Kong","Francis L. F. LEE, Gary TANG","radio talk shows, social change, media interactions, public opinion, historical analysis","In Hong Kong, audience participation radio talk shows on public affairs have existed for decades. Historically, such shows have played different social and political roles in the city. This article reviews the historical development of audience participation radio talk shows. More importantly, it constructs a “multilevel interaction model” as a theoretical framework to analyze the relationships between macro-level socio-political change and the development of a specific media type. The model considers the relationships and interactions between the following: 1) media and social political structures, 2) media and other social and political actors, 3) different types of media, and 4) different media outlets of the same type. Our analysis shows that audience participation shows emerged as an institution for official-citizen communication. They then mutated into a public forum in the 1980s, and then became a watchdog medium with significant monitoring and critical functions in the late 1990s. After 2004, the criticalness of audience participation talk shows declined. The more prominent radio shows often serve as platforms for government officials’ “accountability performance.” We also contend that, at different stages, the transformation of audience participation radio talk shows can begin at different levels. Sometimes transformation begins with macro-level changes, but it can also be driven by more micro-level dynamics.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=335,24,2013,Communication & Society

The results show that the mobility of Hong Kong newspaper journalists is accelerating and many of them move to work in a more stable industry.

Exploring Local Media Systems in China: An Important Political Resource for Urban Contention,"Fanxu ZENG, Guangsheng HUANG","local media system, urban contention, journalist network, arenas of public opinion","In China, the media in different regions have formed different local media systems sharing different media cultures and news operation standards. These local media systems have become a very important political resource for urban contention and have shaped the latter. Previous literature about the relationship between media and social protests ignore the local media system as an important variable. Using case studies, content analysis, and in-depth interviews as research methods, this paper draws upon the theory of social network to describe the special news production mechanism in Guangzhou during urban contention. The research finds that in a well-developed local media system, different local media organizations share similar media cultures and news operation standards, which urge them to compete with and learn from each other, and to actively mobilize their social connections with media organizations and journalists nationwide and worldwide to report on the local protests. By doing so, the local media system has successfully made local urban contention a hot issue in the different arenas of public opinion including local, national, and international, thus avoiding the local government’s propaganda censorship. One argument put forward in this paper is that the local media systems have become a very important political resource for urban contention in China, which influences the outcomes of urban contention. Also, in the process of interacting with urban contention, the local media systems enhance their publicness and autonomy from local control.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=41&CA_ID=332,24,2013,Communication & Society

From Backstage to Frontstage: The Visualization of Journalism in the New Media Environment,Baohua ZHOU,"frontstage, backstage, new media, visualization, news production, blog, microblog","Inspired by Erving Goffman's classic concepts of “backstage” and “frontstage” as well as Joshua Meyrowitz's “medium theory”, this paper analyzes the increasing visualization of journalism in the new media environment. It argues that the rise of new media, especially social media, exposes journalism – including the news production process, “liquid” news texts, news discourses, organizational practices, and journalists themselves – to unprecedented public scrutiny. It discusses the technological, political, social, cultural, and economic mechanisms behind the visualization process and the implications for journalistic professionalism, journalistic authority, and journalistic aspirations. On the one hand, the visualization of journalism challenges some basic norms of journalistic professionalism and journalistic authority, on the other hand, it helps to construct journalistic authority and facilitates the development of journalistic professionalism since it reconfigures the relationship between journalism and political control. It also reconfigures the relationship between professional journalists and their audience (amateur journalists). In this sense, it constitutes a platform for the audience to access media knowledge and engage in media production, and for journalists to imagine their professional fame. The visualization of journalism from “backstage” and “frontstage” is thus a process of redefining news, news work, and journalistic paradigms, a process which opens a new space for the study of journalism.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=40&CA_ID=327,25,2013,Communication & Society
Weibo Communication and the Epistemic Authority of Chinese Journalism: A Case Study of the 2011 Wenzhou High-speed Train Incident,Jingrong TONG,"the epistemic authority of journalism, Weibo communication, China, Wenzhou High-speed Incident, objectivity","Journalism needs to develop and maintain an epistemic authority in interpreting reality and deciding what information should be transmitted to readers. In doing so, journalism defends its legitimacy. This paper is drawn from an analysis of Weibo messages and newspaper coverage of the Wenzhou High-speed Train Incident in 2011. Qualitative interviews with journalists offer some supplementary explanations regarding what was found in the analysis. This paper has two aims. The first is to discuss both whether and to what extent Weibo messages about this incident have explained “what happened/is happening” in reality. The second is to assess how Chinese journalism has endeavored to defend its epistemic authority through constructing a narrative of reality. This study reveals that Weibo communication has advantages in releasing initial information about the incident and in facilitating netizens' efforts to hold the government accountable. As a result, Weibo communication has influenced newspaper agendas to a certain degree. However, a fuller interpretation of reality is still offered by newspapers. Weibo messages are merely treated as one type of news source. According to their respective reporting paradigms and news values, the two newspapers analyzed in this study have selected and incorporated Weibo messages into their conventional news reporting. They have adopted different strategies in establishing an image of being able to provide credible and objective narratives of reality. These provide evidence of defending the epistemic authority of journalism. The whole process suggests that journalists constantly reflect on their own work and the concept of news and make adjustments accordingly.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=40&CA_ID=326,25,2013,Communication & Society

However, the paper argues that because the news should present its content as clearly as possible, the hypermedia format in online news could bring the value of news into crisis since the meaning of hypermedia online news is often uncertain. How can this problem be resolved? Should we give up on the possibility of writing news within the format of hypermedia? In this paper, Bakhtin's theory of dialogism is introduced as a way to solve this problem. It was Julia Kristeva who used Bakhtin's theory of dialogism as an example to establish the importance of intertextuality in the realm of literary theory. However, this paper contends that the concept of intertextuality inherent in Bakhtin's dialogism is diffident to that of Kristeva. The function of intertextuality in Bakhtin's dialogism could bring the intertextual content into recognized meaning by the audience. From this perspective, the format of hypermedia could be applied to the writing of multimedia news.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=40&CA_ID=323,25,2013,Communication & Society
"Group Events, Conventional Practice of News Media and Interest Articulation of Vulnerable Groups",Chao-Qun WANG,"group events, vulnerable groups, interest articulation, news media","In China's current transitional society with a high frequency of group events and the inadequacy of vulnerable groups' interest-articulation channels, does the news media support such vulnerable groups' interest articulation? What are the differences between different types of media representation? This paper examines the five following representative newspapers in China: the People's Daily, the Nanfang Daily, the China Youth Daily, the Southern Metropolis Daily, and the New Beijing Daily. The paper analyzes the content of these newspapers' reporting on group events in China from 2008 to 2010. The study found that Chinese newspapers provide only a very limited space and amount of opportunities for vulnerable groups to express themselves. Some newspaper media outlets have, however, tried to expose the social problems evidenced in group events, documented settlement problems, and adhered to the strict standards of news professionalism. In doing so, they have produced some positive results. Compared to those weakly market-oriented party newspapers, those professionalism-oriented party newspapers and the highly market-oriented city newspapers can provide more opportunities and larger space for vulnerable groups to articulate their interest.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=40&CA_ID=322,25,2013,Communication & Society

According to the SCCT, three factors shape the threat to an organization's reputation: initial crisis responsibility, crisis history, and the organization's prior relational reputation. The SCCT also states that when deciding what communication strategies to use in repairing an organization's image, the amount of crisis responsibility needs to be determined in order to design a suitable set of strategies for the crisis. This study examined how the two factors—same type of crisis history and paired communication strategies—affected an organization's reputation.

The Logic of Connective Action: Digital Media and the Personalization of Contentious Politics,"W. Lance BENNETT, Alexandra SEGERBERG Translators: Anbin SHI, Yunkang YANG","connective action, collective action, contentious politics, digital media","From Arab Spring and Los Indignado in Spain, to Occupy Wall Street (and beyond), large-scale, sustained protests are using digital media in ways that go beyond sending and receiving messages. Some of these formations contain relatively small roles for formal brick and mortar organizations. Others involve well-established advocacy organizations, in hybrid relation with other organizations, using technology that enable personalized public engagement. Both stand in the contrast to the more familiar organizationally managed and brokered action conventionally associated with social movement and issue advocacy. This article examines the organizational dynamics that emerge when communication becomes a prominent part of organizational structure. It argues that understanding such variations in large-scale action networks requires distinguishing at least two logics that may be in play: The familiar logic of “collective action” associated with high levels of organizational resources and the formation of collective identities, and the less familiar logic of “connective action” based on personalized content sharing across media networks. In the former, introducing digital media do not change the core dynamics of the action. In the case of the latter, they do. Building on these distinctions, the article presents three ideal types of large-scale action networks that are becoming prominent in the contentious politics of the contemporary era.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=39&CA_ID=315,26,2013,Communication & Society

He explores how our understanding of “the myth of the mediated centre” will change as the analysis is extended beyond the Western contexts of UK and USA and to places such as China. Couldry also touches on the concept of “voice” which he elaborated in a book of his, treating it as a value cherished by all human beings to express themselves and represent the world.

The author adopts the doublearticulation theory developed by Roger Silverstone, David Morley and Eric Hirsch, and argues that online news consumption is a kind of social and cultural practice that includes two dimensions—text/symbol and technology/ material—that are intertwined. Empirical data show that, via different practices, online news consumers, in addition to news information reception, tend to integrate news consumption and their everyday life activities and experiences. Five types of online news consumption practices are identified: habitual consumption, innovative consumption, social interactive consumption, information-searching consumption and information-wandering consumption.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=312,27,2014,Communication & Society

This research explores the differential knowledge production in the Chinese micro blogosphere through a case study of Sina Weibo users’ discussion about nuclear power during Japan’s nuclear crisis in 2011. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of related Weibo messages reveal a knowledge production gap even in this relatively open social network with its low barrier of knowledge production. While knowledge production on the Weibo platform is more grassroots-oriented, traditionally dominant social groups are playing a more significant role in the knowledge production process. They not only produce knowledge in a more active and rational way, but they also generate greater social influence in the micro blogosphere.

Electronic Symbolic Actors in Networked Society: Reconstructing “Audience” Subjectivity as Envisioned in the Case of Taiwan,"Lin-Mei HUANG, Mary SHEN, Kai-Ming TSAO","electronic symbolic actors, symbolic action, agent referents, Kuokuang petrochemical development projects, Facebook of National Youth Union for Anti‐Kuokuang petrochemical development projects.","Following the rise of a networked society with ubiquitous personal media, the long-held boundary between senders and receivers is increasingly blurred. As a result, “audience” as a concept increasingly loses its explanatory power, especially when social interactions that are taking place or are initiated/ intensified on the web actually affect the social world off the web. Therefore, this research aims to reconstruct audience subjectivity in a networked communication environment. In the first part, the concept of “electronic symbolic actors” is discussed, with the audience treated as willing participants and active actors, rather than passive receivers/consumers, even if they are different from senders/producers by degrees of activeness. A theoretical framework is then presented, with the subjectivity of participants examined through three aspects: the nature of symbolic actors, the nature of his/her action, and criteria of action assessment. The second part is an empirical study of Taiwan's Kuokuang Petrochemical development projects, now nullified due to web-based environmental activists. As a preliminary study based on the framework of “electronic symbolic actors,” only the nature of actors is explored, with the sit-in protests from April 21–22, 2011, initiated by the National Youth Union for Anti-Petrochemical Development Projects, as the research focus. The data for analysis were collected from the Union's Facebook pages from April 15 to May 7, 2011. Based on a total of 263 posts and 521 comments, the usage of agent referents was checked systematically in order to study how self–other relationships and group consciousness were perceived by participants, who, in their online symbolic actions, supposedly looked for selfidentity and community belonging, with various degrees of activeness due to different choices of value priority. In conclusion, the authors assert the nature of the actors examined in the case study was in accord with what was expected.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=310,27,2014,Communication & Society
The Politics of Watching History: Chinese Audiences,George Dawei GUO,"contemporary Chinese television historical drama, Mainland Chinese audiences, audience research, cultural competences, classic-ness","Since the mid-1990s, a wave of dramatic serials featuring the legendary figures of China's bygone dynasties has emerged on Chinese primetime television. The commercialization of mass media and the rise of media consumerism in China since the early 1990s have fostered the emergence of these historical dramas. Set during the dynasty era, these television serials have been at the forefront in articulating political and legal principles based on the Confucian-influenced traditional Chinese culture. Although media scholars have interpreted the popularity of these historical dramas as a revival of Confucianism, virtually no empirical research has been done to explore how Chinese audiences relate their viewing experiences to the revival of Confucianism according to their own social and cultural conditions. This article presents a qualitative audience study of how the historical dramas are understood and socially and culturally valued in contemporary China, considering personal, social, historical, and cultural issues that relate to viewers' engagement with this television genre. Between late September 2007 and early April 2008, the author carried out his fieldwork audience research in two urban Chinese settings: Beijing and Changsha. Ten focus groups were conducted involving more than 50 respondents from young adult and middle-aged audience groups. The author identifies two text-based interpretive frameworks— fact/fiction and “classic-ness”—that were adopted by the respondents across all the focus groups in their understanding and evaluation of the historical programs. In conclusion, the author argues that the relationship between the historical drama genre and its audiences represents imaginative conflicts and ideological clashes in the treatment of the state as a totalitarian entity in China’s television culture sphere.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=309,27,2014,Communication & Society

A total of 3,500 college students sampled from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taipei were surveyed on why and how they use their mobile phones to stay informed. The results show that the respondents' common motivations for mobile phone use included “being connected with friends and relatives,” “maintaining relationships,” “entertainment and relaxation,” and “sharing opinions.” Another motivation evaluated was “getting news and information.” Even though the “getting news and information” motivation was not rated highly, it was a strong and significant predictor of mobile news seeking. Two of the other motivations (namely “maintaining relationships” and “sharing opinions”) also predicted using mobile phones to seek news. Among the four samples, the motivation of “entertainment and relaxation” was found to be a significant predictor of seeking mobile news both in Shanghai and Hong Kong, whereas the motivation of “maintaining relationships” was only a significant predictor in the Hong Kong sample. The study ends with a discussion of how the role of the versatile smart phone affects the relationship between the motivations for mobile phone use and the behavior of seeking mobile news.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=38&CA_ID=307,27,2014,Communication & Society

Cultural Communication and Chinese Modernity in the Late Qing and Republican China Periods,Xiaosui XIAO,,"Late Qing and Republican China represent two important, yet largely overlooked, periods in the Chinese history of communication. These periods witnessed a large number of communication events, at various scales, that emerged to propagate the idea of modernity. Mainstream scholarship has tended to study these two periods from an elitist perspective by focusing on great political and cultural events such as the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s–1890s, the Reform Movement of the 1890s–1900s, and the New Culture Movement of 1915–1925 and by concentrating on leading figures such as Zhang Zhidong, Liang Qichao, Tan Sitong, Yan Fu, Chen Duxiu, and Hu Shi. Consequently, such studies have been blinded to the other side of modernist practice exemplified by popular journalists, fiction writers, movie makers, and many others.

Unlike the negative connotations of triviality, self-indulgence, and even puerile pursuits that the term tends to carry today, wenyi at the time promised a sophisticated, worldly experience. My paper will map the trajectory of wenyi and clarify its importance, including its shifting meanings driven by literary and political forces, and, more crucially, place it in a fluid cultural environment of literary enlightenment and social reform. By means of content analysis of hundreds of film advertisements printed in Shenbao, we discover that wenyi’s cultural currency was firmly in place in promoting film consumption.

This paper focuses on the study of the Shanghai Lithography Association, analyzing its function of management and supervision of the modern Shanghai lithography industry and endeavoring to reflect the complexity of the production and pervasive influence of modern knowledge. The book guild had played the role of the “gatekeeper” for the production and spread of knowledge in traditional China, however, the change in modern society required it to shift from its original role to that of a “pathfinder.” The modern lithography of Shanghai came into being as a result of the introduction of Western technologies, yet its organization, i.e., the Shanghai Lithography Association (shuyegongsuo), bore a strong resemblance to that of the traditional guilds. It could neither follow the original track of “gatekeeper” nor become the “pathfinder” that would lead the change in the industry, and therefore it was in an awkward and difficult situation. The dilemma of the Shanghai Lithography Association vividly reflects the contradictions and difficulties that the traditional guild was entangled in during the process of transformation brought about by modernization. Though the whole industry was established upon the new technology of lithography introduced from the West, due to its limited capability and size, the Shanghai Lithograph Association still retained the traditional guild’s concept of restricting competition for the purpose of stabilizing the industry. Conservative in its function, it could not play much of a role in the development of the industry, and therefore was phased out. This paper argues that the modern transformation of traditional industry cannot rely solely upon the introduction of new technologies, but also calls for the joint innovation of the whole system of the industry.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=36&CA_ID=298,29,2014,Communication & Society
Toward the Opposite Side of Vulgarity: The Birth of Cinema as a “Healthful Entertainment” and the Shanghai Y.M.C.A.,Yoshino SUGAWARA,"Shanghai Y.M.C.A., movie exhibition, healthful entertainment, industrial movie, Lantern slide","This article explores the new movie milieu created by the Shanghai Y. M.C.A. in the early twentieth century in Shanghai that was associated with the modernization of movie going. After cinema came to Shanghai at the end of the nineteenth century, it was mainly exhibited at commercial amusement sites, most of which were notorious for the lack of public morals. The movie milieu which emerged as a part of the commercial amusement culture in Shanghai succeeded that of traditional theatergoing. Watching a movie was not the exclusive and ultimate purpose for moviegoers during that era, they usually enjoyed eating, drinking, and chatting with friends while a movie was exhibited. Moreover, immorality and vulgarity were always associated with movie exhibition venues in Shanghai. However, during the 1910s, Shanghai Y.M.C.A.’s non-commercial movie exhibitions contributed to the improvement of the cinema’s social standing as well as the discovery of movies’ educational values. The Y.M.C.A. exhibited movies as “wholesome and healthful entertainment,” which means that the movie screenings at the Y.M.C.A. were completely devoid of the vulgarity of Shanghai’s other commercial movie exhibitions. These movie exhibitions at the Y.M.C.A. can be roughly categorized into the following two types: (1) as entertainment during recreation events and (2) as visual aids for lectures. In the former instance, movies were projected at various meetings for the sake of civilized and modern leisure. Although the genres of the films screened at these events ranged from documentary to detective series, based on their policy for movie selection, it was obvious that the association considered movies a modern, healthful form of entertainment that cultivated young people. The purpose of utilizing movies in the latter instance emphasized the educational value of movies. The association had an explicit policy both for improving public health and popularizing scientific knowledge and industrial techniques through the lectures held in various occasions. In order to attract wider audiences, the primary concern for the Y.M.C.A. to develop their lecture events was the effective use of lantern slides and then movies. In order to achieve this purpose, the association established the new section that specialized in publishing visual aids for the lectures. The director of the section, W.W. Peter, later contributed to the Commercial Press, a representative publisher that produced a number of movies in the early era, by producing one of their first documentary films. Both of these types of movie exhibitions helped to prove that cinema had great usefulness, especially for social education in China. Such exibitions also allowed many young new elites in China, who considered the Y.M.C.A. as a place to develop their social skills and create human networks, to be absorbed in cinema. The movie exhibitions sponsored by the Y.M.C.A. can thus be said to have led to the awakening of China’s new movie exhibition culture, which flourished during the next decade.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=36&CA_ID=299,29,2014,Communication & Society
From “the World” to “Nation-State”: The “Voice” and Speech Culture in the Language Movement of Late Qing,Hua HUANG,"he World, nation-state, voice, phonocentrism, communication situation","The Phoneticization Movement and speech culture were launched during the Late Qing period. Voices repressed by Hanzi and Hanwen gradually came to the surface of history. This research explores why people paid attention to the voice in the late Qing Dynasty, including what kind of social metaphors were hidden behind the prosperity of speech culture, and how phonocentrism became involved in the process of building the “nation-state.” This research reveals that during the transition from the “world” to the “nation-state,” communication changed in three dimensions and voice participated in the reconstruction of the information boundary. The rise of speech culture was, to some extent, an imitation of the Japanese experience. More importantly, it conformed to the “kuai” consciousness. Phonocentrism led to the cleavage between the modern written language and the classical language, therefore, the construction of the “nation-state” was lacking in reliable contact with the tradition, and the construction of “Xinmin” served the interests of different political groups.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=36&CA_ID=300,29,2014,Communication & Society

Thus, studying China's national image as reported by international media becomes particularly important. For a long time, China's image has been no more than lucid. Opinion polling is a special form of international news reporting that provides rich and objective information for us to examine a country's national image. We analyzed the content of international media coverage of public opinion polls about China from 1979 to 2009. Results show that news coverage of polls about China increased over the past 30 years. Our analysis also finds that the topics and tones of news coverage of polls about China changed over this period. Media from different areas tended to focus on different aspects of polls about China and employed different tones in reporting polls about China. Media from Hong Kong and Macau and the Western media were more interested in China's internal issues than media in other areas. Media from Hong Kong and Macau were also more likely to employ favorable tones toward China than media from other areas. In addition, media from Hong Kong and Macau were more likely to include methodological information of polls in the coverage of poll stories about China than media from other areas.

Transnational Information Politics: The Interaction between Local Contentions and International Media,Vincent Guangsheng HUANG,"globalization, contentious politics in Mainland China, transnational information politics, international media, resources mobilization","In the globalization era, the interaction between local grassroots protests and international media has given rise to the “transnational information politics”. Having exerted great pressure on domestic political control, transnational information politics has posted challenge to the authoritarian rule in many countries. Previous research tends to treat the international media as scarce resources that local grassroots activists desperately need. However, it seems that in some cases the grassroots activists tend to refuse to speak out their voices in the international media space. Why are some activists eager to get access to the international media and some are not? Drawing on the theoretical perspective of resources mobilization, this research describes and then examines this interaction processes by comparing two protest cases from China. By contextualizing the role of international media in different protest cases, the author proposes theoretical advances by introducing the concepts of “dynamic political context” to understand the complex role international media play in local grassroots protests. The author argues that as important protest resources, the usefulness and constraints of international media varied with the dynamic political context. This paper concludes that the dynamic political context ultimately shapes the ways in which local grassroots activists and international media interact, and determines the degree to which local grassroots activism can evolve into transnational information politics.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=35&CA_ID=288,30,2014,Communication & Society

The causes of obesity have been associated with a variety of genetic, systemic, and individual behaviors. This study attempts to determine the ways in which the media frame the causes of obesity and whether the causes of obesity differ between adults and children. We conducted a content analysis of the coverage of obesity in The New York Times from 1985 to 2011. The results suggested that obesity among adults was much more likely than in children to be attributed to individual behaviors, genetic and biological reasons, and unhealthy food intake. Consistent with this finding, clinical and pharmaceutical solutions, as well as lifestyle changes were often cited as solutions to the problem of obesity among adults. In contrast, obesity among children was predominantly attributed to systemic causes, such as the marketing of unhealthy foods and impediments to exercising at home and in school. Hence, the prescribed solutions to the problem of obesity in children are mainly school-related.

The research focuses on understanding the problem in the context of a particular time and space, specifically, the living habits of residents in two communities. The review of anthropological studies in the literature on health communication in communities yielded rich ethnographic details about their cultural practices and behaviors. We conducted a systematic observation of the communication between the two communities in order to determine the extent to which health information was conveyed. We attempted to link the larger issues of socioeconomic factors with the accessibility, affordability, and availability of health communication. The research findings contribute to previous observations and data in the literature by clarifying the structural components of the communication mechanism through which living habits and behavioral patterns are related to health communication among different groups of people. Specifically, the study investigated the relationships among folklore, traditional, and modern medicine, as expressed by the representative samples of two communities.

The first phase of this study is to develop a short film with fear appeal. The script and production of the film was based on three rounds of focus groups that identified the physical and psychological dimensions of fears relevant to the MSM group. The second phase of this study is to launch this fear packed film online and a post-viewing questionnaire was conducted among MSM to gauge the effectiveness of fear, in the context of the health belief model. The results show that the film is very effective in inducing cognitive, emotive and behavioral changes. Among 50 MSM viewers, many felt scared (66%), worried (64%), panicky (56%) and anxious (52%) after viewing the film. Cognitively, 92% of viewers believed that they had gained knowledge of toward syphilis and genital warts. Behaviorally, 78% of viewers would be more likely to use condom use consistently (78%), take up HIV antibody testing (60%), and maintain a single sexual partner (56%). Comparing with the results obtained by the baseline questionnaire, percentages with increased perceived severity and, perceived susceptibility were respectively 36%, and 58%. The correlation analysis show that fear arousal is associated with more likelihood to feel scared of having the disease, perceived susceptibility and severity of contracting STDs, gaining knowledge towards STDs and consistently using condoms during anal sex. Regression analysis further shows that feeling scared is a strong predictor with direct effect on using condoms during anal sex consistently and testing for HIV. Overall, the linkages among perceived susceptibility, perceived severity and behaviors variables are non-existent, posing a challenge to the health belief model using fear appeal—maybe a strong fear is simply an overwhelmingly irrational force that can impact behaviors directly.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=34&CA_ID=278,31,2015,Communication & Society

A quantitative content analysis was conducted on four mainstream and four alternative news media in Taiwan, respectively, from August 9, 2009 to the end of 2011, generating a total of 1,953 articles. In addition to exploring the energy types and quoted sources of the alternative energy-related issues and how they varied by media, the study analyzed the news frames and compared the differences among various alternative forms of energy. The study then went further to examine how the news media represented the mechanisms that could contribute to the public engagement in alternative energy-related issues and how they varied by media and energy type, respectively. Overall, great attention has been paid to issues related to alternative energy. Nevertheless, the news coverage was lacking in elements that could increase public engagement in the issues, especially the mainstream media. News coverage of non-nuclear forms of alternative energy was also lower in elements of public engagement than those of nuclear energy. As news related to non-nuclear forms of alternative energy was mostly framed in a positive and promotional fashion, the intention to increase its relevance to the audience might weaken the sense of public engagement in choosing between various forms of alternative energy.

The aim of the study is to illustrate the logic and complexity of the error correction mechanism in the Chinese media. The empirical analysis of the content of corrections and apologies in some media showed the fooling results. First, the mainstream media in China were found to do more text correction and passive correction, offer fewer explanations of errors, and have a greater tendency to evade crucial points. Second, the objects of apology were governments rather than audiences. Third, unlike professional journalism in the US, correction and apology behavior in the Chinese media is often not only immoral and illegal but also politically motivated. Governments are usually the strongest sources of pressure. Under governmental pressure and market influence, the correction and apology behavior of the Chinese media differs between the private and public. Public correction and apology is optional and ritualistic. Private correction and apology, even internal reflection, is normal behavior.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=255,33,2015,Communication & Society
Ethical Reflection and Decisions in Digital Convergence: The Use of New Media Materials by Taiwanese TV Journalists,Huei-Ling LIU,"digital convergence, professional ethics, privacy, fact-checking, strategic ritual","New ethical issues have been raised in the era of digital convergence. How do journalists perceive these ethical issues and make appropriate decisions based on them? Bourdieu's field theory is applied to explore the relations and interactions with individual journalists and news organizations when they are faced with ethical dilemmas. This qualitative study interviews 17 Taiwanese TV journalists to gather data on the following issues: First, the heavy reliance on new media materials in TV news productions causes ethical controversy, the most serious issues being the lack of fact-checking and intrusion into personal privacy. Second, in many cases, even though journalists perceive the seriousness of the ethical controversy, they rationalize their behavior in pursuit of higher ratings and profit. Third, journalists are rarely proactive in protecting the privacy of people who are involved in news, and in many cases, they do not fact check thoroughly. This study also revisits the ""strategic ritual"" initiated by Tuchman and finds that the use of new media materials has led to new strategic rituals in the newsroom, which has gradually influenced the habitus of journalism in Taiwan.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=254,33,2015,Communication & Society
Justification of Deceptive Practices: Journalists' Attitudes towards Controversial Reporting Practices in Mainland China,"Jianyou HUANG, Zhi'an ZHANG","controversial reporting practices, journalists, journalism ethics","This study examines journalists' attitudes towards controversial reporting practices, changes, and influencing factors in mainland China. Based on a survey of 2,109 journalists from five press groups (newspapers) and 28 media organizations, this study found that the attitudes of Mainland Chinese journalists changed significantly: Their acceptance of controversial reporting practices increased substantially. In particular, deceptive practices, such as paying for confidential information (""checkbook"" journalism), claiming to be somebody else, using actors to re-create of news events, and using hidden microphones or cameras were highly accepted by the respondents (85.5%), Among these practices, paying for confidential information and claiming to be somebody else were the most prominent. More than 90 percent of journalists believed these practices were acceptable. Surprisingly, these two practices were reported as the most unacceptable by American journalists, which underlines the difference between journalistic practices in China the US. In addition, false reporting practices, including modifying news photos, being paid by sources, publishing without verification, and altering or fabricating information were relatively difficult for journalists to accept. Nonetheless, the degree of acceptance was 17.7%. ""Aggressive reporting practices"" appeared to be the most controversial one with an acceptance rate of 44.6%. These practices include being employed in a firm or organization to gain inside information, badgering an unwilling informant to get a story, using confidential documents without authorization, and using personal documents, such as letters and photographs, without permission. Moreover, the respondents appeared to be more tolerant of these practices than they were in the past. This finding may be significantly correlated with the weakening of constraints, such as on media organization, social institutions, social relation, social systems, and individual and market operations during social and media transitions. In other words, the weaker the effects of these factors on journalists, the more they are inclined to accept controversial reporting practices. These results indicate that the media in Mainland China may face the great risk of moving toward decay. The data analysis also showed that demographic variables, media category, and journalists' attitudes towards controversial reporting practices were significantly correlated. In particular, older journalists and woman were more reluctant to accept controversial reporting practices. It is noteworthy that, compared with the print media, journalists in online media were more tolerant of reporting practices that falsify news events.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=256,33,2015,Communication & Society
Ethical Gaps in Journalism Education: How Journalism Students Perceive Journalistic Ethics and Media Performance,Herng SU,"media ethics, professionalism, relativism, idealism, Taiwan","This study focuses on student's ethical ideologies and their recognition of ethics in journalism. The subjects of the research reported in this paper were 1,666 university students majoring in journalism or communication-related fields in Taiwan. The study found that in general the subjects in journalism and communication departments were not satisfied with media ethics or their performance. The results indicated that universal standards, or relativism, were associated with ethical ideologies and perceived importance of journalism ethics. However, in this context, a course in journalism ethics was not a significant predictor of agreement with ethical principles in the media. Ethical ideologies (idealism and relativism) were associated with the students' own ethical principles and norms of journalism ethics. The experience of internship in a newsroom was associated with the perceived justifiability of using questionable newsgathering methods. The study also explores key aspects of the construct of media ethics with the goal of laying the groundwork for future empirical investigations of the issues raised here.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=257,33,2015,Communication & Society
A Study of the Journalistic Qualities and Ethical Dilemmas of Institutional Citizen Journalism: Four Citizen Websites of Taiwan's News Organizations,Yuling LIN,"institutional citizen journalism, objectivity, transparency, open ethics, professional ethics","This study adopts a content analysis to examine four differently operated citizen websites of news organizations in Taiwan. The aim of the study is to understand the journalistic quality and ethical issues of institutional citizen journalism. The findings showed that while quality is influenced by the resources and qualifications of citizen journalists in institutional citizen journalism, it is also affected by the operations of an organization. Based on a profit model, the analysis showed that citizen websites provided a higher proportion of advertisements and activity messages as well as the lack of author information and interactive responses. Based on a non-profit model, the analysis showed that citizen websites are more likely to feature a greater diversity of topics and narratives, details about author information, and interactive responses. The results of this study raised two important ethical issues: First, citizen platforms of news organizations neglect the importance of a mechanism for participatory transparency. Second, citizen websites do not clearly distinguish advertisements and news, especially in profit-citizen platforms.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=258,33,2015,Communication & Society
"Ethics in a Multimedia Age: An Examination of News Exposure, Media Trust, and Personal Ethics in Taiwan",Meng-Yen HSU and Herng SU,"media ethics, multimedia environment, ethics, idealism, relativism, survey","Media ethics is a subdivision of applied ethics. It deals with ethical principles and standards that are specific to the media. In a multimedia environment, the changing media landscape enables communication technologies to engage in discussions of media ethics. Based on the theoretical concepts of ethical relativism and ethical universalism, the study aims to examine the extent to which news exposure and media trust are predictors of ethical perceptions. The research is also designed to explore five research questions: 1) What is the public understanding of media ethics? 2) How does new media exposure relate to perceptions of media ethics? 3) What factors influence attitudes towards ethical media content? 4) What factors influence attitudes toward contentious information gathering methods? 5) How do different ethical perspectives guide ethical decision making. A multi-stage systematic sampling technique was used to perform computer-assisted telephone interviews with 1,025 Taiwanese adults aged 20 and above in September 2010. The responses indicated that remaining neutral and objective were the two most important professional moral values among the related issues. When the participants were asked to rate the news sources they trusted the most, more than 50 percent chose the television news over other news sources. Most responses indicated that newspapers were the second most trusted source of news. The results showed no significant relation between the respondents' attitudes toward the ethics of media content, media exposure, and media trust. The heavy use of online news use was positively related to media trust and willingness to accept questionable information-gathering methods. To conclude, the article discusses how media developments encourage the transition from traditional journalism ethics to ""new media ethics,"" in which ethics is the concern of all citizens. The limitations of the study are discussed, and recommendations for future studies on media ethics are provided.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=31&CA_ID=259,33,2015,Communication & Society

Influencing Factors of Chinese Mainland Newspaper Journalists,"Lihong ZENG, Yan WU","Work autonomy, journalists, cognition of the media's role, skills of internet use","According to newspaper journalists in mainland China, this thesis is part of the largest survey research in the last 15 years. The thesis' aim is to investigate mainland newspaper journalists' work autonomy and its influencing factors in the new media environment. Through literature review, it is found that in most of the previous studies, journalists chose the structural functionalism paradigm view and ignored the investigation of journalists' individual characteristics.Breaking through the limitations of traditional methodology and using quantitative study methods, this study is designed to explore how journalists' individual characteristic variables affect their work autonomy. The following are the main research problems of this study: What is the overall situation of Chinese mainland newspaper journalists' work autonomy under the new media environment? Can the Chinese mainland newspaper journalists' cognition of media role and skills of internet use predict journalists' work autonomy? Through questionnaires and statistical analysis, this study has two conclusions: First, there is a decline of mainland journalists' overall evaluation of work autonomy in the new media environment, second, on the basis of controlling the demographic variables, Chinese mainland newspaper journalists' cognition of the media's role and skills of internet use both have prominent impacts on their work autonomy.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=27&CA_ID=223,34,2015,Communication & Society
"The Internet and Friendship Networks:Replacement, Augmentation, and Stimulation",Chen-Chao TAO,"friendship formation, network size, social interaction, social media, strong ties","The advent of the Internet affects friendship networks. There are three different hypotheses regarding this. The displacement hypothesis argues that new friends who meet online will replace existing friends in the real world. The augmentation hypothesis contends that new friends who meet online will expand the size of their friendship networks. The stimulation hypothesis proposes that the Internet enhances the strength of existing friends and enlarges strong-tie networks. Using the nationally representative sample in the 2012 Taiwan Communication Survey, this study investigates whether different hypotheses apply to different Internet applications. The results show that the Internet actually increases, not decreases, social interactions with existing friends, but these social interactions neither create strong ties for new friends who meet online nor translate existing weak ties into strong ties, especially for social media. It is concluded that friendship networks influence the social use of the Internet.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=27&CA_ID=224,34,2015,Communication & Society

In its news coverage, Xinhua Agency has featured information about the family life and personal experience of Jinping Xi and his wife Liyuan Peng. Contrary to the established frames used in covering First Ladies in Western countries, the frames used by the Chinese media covering Liyuan Peng are mainly two-fold: in a supportive role and as a spokesperson. An analysis of the first frame portrays Xi and Peng as tending to cooperate with each other for image improvement while the spokesperson frame shows the media's inclination toward associating the personal image of Jinping Xi and LiyuanPeng with the national image.

Does the Great Firewall Really Isolate the Chinese?Integrating Access Blockage with Cultural Factors to Explain Web User Behavior,"Harsh TANEJA, Angela Xiao WU","access blockage, audience duplication, censorship, cultural proximity, culturally defined markets, Internet, filtering, globalization, media choice","The dominant understanding of Internet censorship posits that blocking access to foreign-based websites creates isolated communities of Internet users. We question this discourse for its assumption that if given access people would use all websites. We develop a conceptual framework that integrates access blockage with social structures to explain web users’ choices, and argue that users visit websites they find culturally proximate and access blockage matters only when such sites are blocked. We examine the case of China, where online blockage is notoriously comprehensive, and compare Chinese web usage patterns with those elsewhere. Analyzing audience traffic among the 1,000 most visited websites, we find that websites cluster according to language and geography. Chinese websites constitute one cluster, which resembles other such geo-linguistic clusters in terms of both its composition and degree of isolation.Our sociological investigation reveals a greater role of cultural proximity than access blockage in explaining online behaviors.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=29&CA_ID=239,35,2016,Communication & Society

Two competing discourses were found in The Women magazine: the mainstream discourse of the ideal Chinese woman, and the alternative discourse of liberal feminism. The former discourse aimed at formulating the dominant discourse of the ideal Chinese women, asserting that Chinese females should pursue the goal of being good wives and loving mothers, including career women. The latter discourse called for human rights and gender equality by re-interpreting history, challenging Confucianism, and arguing that women should be able to develop freely and fully outside the family. Based on the results of the analysis, the study concludes that the conflict between these two competing female discourses represents the dilemmas and difficulties involved in being a Taiwanese woman at that time.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=29&CA_ID=240,35,2016,Communication & Society

This study compares two sets of survey data that were collected from J-school students in mainland China and Hong Kong in 2008 and 2014 in order to investigate how journalists-to-be from different socio-political contexts perceive the role of their future profession. The comparison showed that the differences between the perceptions of students in mainland China and Hong Kong regarding journalistic roles and the courses offered in J-schools have narrowed during the past six years. By measuring students' perceptions of the role of journalists in a society, this study adds the role of consonance to those of interpreter, adversarial, populist mobilizer, disseminator, and provider of culture and entertainment. While both groups of students regarded the latter five journalistic roles as more important than the role of consonance, in 2014, the Hong Kong students rated the role of consonance significantly lower than the mainland China students did. Furthermore, students' personal media usage patterns and individual attitudes affected their perceptions of journalistic roles. The findings showed that in both groups of students, perceptions of the journalistic role of consonance, the degree of patriotism, and the nationalist aims of journalism all declined from 2008 to 2014.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=30&CA_ID=248,36,2016,Communication & Society

The purpose of the study is to examine the relationships between media multitasking, social well-being, and social capital. An in-class survey of 654 college students conducted in the spring of 2012 in five universities in Taipei, Taiwan examined the relationships between social well-being, social capital, peer pressure, social success, and media use—including watching videos, playing video games, listening to music, reading/homework, e-mailing/posting on social media sites, texting/instant messaging, and talking on phones/video chatting—and face-to-face communication. Regression analyses indicated that while social well-being was not associated with media multitasking, certain dimensions of social capital were positively associated with it. Peer acceptance was also positively correlated with media multitasking. Face-to-face communication was associated with positive social well-being, social capital, peer acceptance, and social success. The level of media multitasking was positively predicted by time spent on video and video games and negatively predicted by time spent on reading/homework. Our study hypothesizes possible causes for these relationships, calls for research designs to address causality, and outlines possible implications of such findings for the well-being, peer acceptance and social capital of younger adolescents.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=33&CA_ID=274,37,2016,Communication & Society
User Labor and the Subjectivity Construction Oriented to Consumerism in Corporate Marketing in Chinese Social Media: Taking Durex’s Official Account on Sina Weibo as an Example,Yanning HUANG,"social media, Weibo, digital labor, the subjectivity construction oriented to consumerism, over-exploitation","By taking the Durex Official Account on Sina Weibo as an example, this essay aims to combine a political economy of communications approach with a cultural studies approach to uncover the phenomena of user labor and its articulation with the subjectivity construction oriented to consumerism in corporate marketing in Chinese social media. Combining content analysis with in-depth interviews, the essay argues that user labor has the dual characteristics of ""free to give"" and ""free to be exploited"": due to the convenience provided by technologies, when social media users create meanings for themselves in the field of media consumption, they also tend to valorize to different extent for the platform providers and the corporate accounts. On the other hand, the single economic claims and the complex mediascapes in contemporary China have been forming and shaping the subjectivity construction that is oriented toward consumerism. Furthermore, this subjectivity construction constitutes an important impetus for the phenomenon of digital labor among Chinese social media users, such that it has, as it were, become a compulsory action in their everyday life.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=33&CA_ID=277,37,2016,Communication & Society
What Does the Contemporary “Wan-Lu-Shen” Sell? The Analysis of Social Support Provided by the Medicine-Selling Programs on Cable TV,"Hung-yi LU, Wei-chu HSU","medicine-selling program, cable TV, social support, communicative marketing strategies","This study, conducted from September 2012 to May 2014, attempts to explore what kind of social support was provided by medicine-selling programs on cable TV in Taiwan, what channels were adopted to impart social support to audiences, and what kind of influence social support has on medicine selling. Field observation and one-on-one interviews were adopted to collect data. The researchers interviewed the manager, programmers, hosts/hostesses, audience members, and the health officer. The result of this study shows that the hosts/hostesses of the medicine-selling programs understand what the audience needs. Social support is an important issue, and thus the hosts/hostesses attempt to maintain close ties with the audience by way of various activities, such as fortune-telling, travelling, and singing. The hosts/hostesses are concerned with the audience members and interact warmly with them. Under such circumstances, the audience members become fans of the hosts/hostesses and buy the products sold by medicine-selling programs.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=33&CA_ID=280,37,2016,Communication & Society
Dialect Program and the Local Media Politics of Mainland China in the New Era: The Case of “Baixiao Talking Show”,Meixi ZHUANG,"Wenzhou dialect, ideology of TV program, market, local media","Using the dialect program ""Baixiao Talking Show"" (BTS) as a case study, the paper aims to analyze how the Chinese dialect programs strive to create an apolitical local public space at a time when the state's power and the market logic prevail. To understand the cultural politics of the dialect program BTS, this paper asks three questions. Firstly, how did BTS rise to power in the local media market? Secondly, what is the ideology of BTS? Thirdly, what kind of public sphere has been created by BTS? By using the research methods of semi-structured interviews and textual analysis, this research found that BTS does not establish a ""localism vis-a-vis nationalism"" relationship with the party-state hegemony, nor is it a transbelt between the center and the local. The paper concludes that the orchestration of state deregulation, returning localism, ongoing marketization, and local media development together give rise to the popularity of dialect programs in contemporary China.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=33&CA_ID=281,37,2016,Communication & Society

The Hostile Media Effects: A Founding Scholar Looks Back and Looks Forward,"Mark LEPPER, Ran WEI",,"Social psychologist Dr. Mark Lepper is the Albert Ray Lang Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. The seminal study he co-authored with his Stanford colleagues—“The hostile media phenomenon: Biased perception and perceptions of media bias in coverage of the Beirut Massacre” (Vallone, Ross, & Lepper,1985)—paved the way for a steady stream of subsequent media research in hostile media effects. Trained at Yale University in the tradition of Hovland’s persuasion work and mentored by presidential campaign consultant Robert Ableson, Dr. Lepper’s lifelong research focuses on motivation (intrinsic vs. extrinsic) and cognitive processes. His empirical research on attributional biases and inferential errors led to the theorization of hostile media effects (HME) phenomena. With a total of 328 cites in SSCI journal articles, HME has grown into a mainstream media effects theory. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the seminal 1985 study, Richard Perloff (2015) of Cleveland State University wrote a Milestone Essay in Mass Communication & Society, which returned HME to the spotlight. Riding on this momentum, the original researcher Mark Lepper looked back in this interview, to trace the theory’s deep intellectual roots, to speculate on its application in non-Western cultures such as China, as well as on future directions for research.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=66&CA_ID=525,38,2016,Communication & Society

The research results showed that the news media communicated different characteristics of the disaster news. The more that the audiences perceived these characteristics, the more they reported a downward social comparison.

A telephone survey of 368 citizens aged above 20 years and living in five major cities in Taiwan was conducted to collect data about their perceptions of public and private companies or firms with which they had any kind of relationship. The results indicated that organizations that interacted with targeted publics used information power, legitimate power, reward power, and coercive power. Only information power, reward power, and coercive power affected the outcomes of relationships with the respondents in this study.

The Influence of Different Guanxi between Gift Giver and Recipient and Appeal Mode on Gift Advertising Persuasion,"Xiaoxue DONG, Shengdong LIN, Qionglin WU","gift-giving ads, guanxi, appeal mode, motivation","Gift giving plays a vital role in building, maintaining, and deepening interpersonal relationships in China, which has created a huge gift market. According to the differential mode of association, guanxi includes emotional relations, instrumental relations, and mixed relations. Three kinds of appeal modes are used in Chinese TV commercials: giver appeal, recipient appeal, and giver-recipient appeal. Experiments are conducted to examine the effects of different forms of guanxi and appeal modes on gift advertising persuasion. Experiment 1 adopts a between-subjects design and uses undergraduates as subjects. The findings showed that the type of guanxi had a significant effect on advertising evaluation, brand evaluation, and purchase intension. Ads that targeted parents and friends were much better than those targeting bosses or superiors. Experiment 2 adopts a between-and within-subject mixed design and uses adults as subjects. The findings showed that both the guanxi type and the appeal mode had significant effects on advertising persuasion. Furthermore, both independent variables had significant or marginally significant interactions. The appeal mode with the presence of both sides was the best in evoking emotions. Compared to instrumental motivation, the both-sides appeal was much better than the one-side appeal in motivating emotional responses to the ads.

The Effects of Crisis-Communication Strategy and Forms of Crisis Response: Crisis Type as a Contingent Factor,Yi-Hui Christine HUANG,"crisis communicative strategy, form of crisis response, relational outcomes, crisis type","From the perspective of crisis communication, this paper aims to determine how the type of crisis influences the relationship between crisis communicative strategies (CCS) and forms of crisis responses and how that relationship affects organization-public relationships (OPR). Three types of crisis on a continuum of perceived crisis responsibility are examined: external-unintentional crises (e.g. natural crises), external-intentional crises (e.g. malevolence), and internal management-related crises. Public affairs and public relations managers were solicited from Taiwan's top 500 companies to participate in a survey. The results indicated that the more that perceived responsibility is involved in crises, the less explanatory power of crisis communicative strategies. In contrast, the more perceived crisis responsibility, the more predictive power of the form of crisis response.

News Media as the Public Monitor in a Large-scale Protest Campaign: The Case of Hong Kong’s Umbrella Movement,Francis L. F. LEE,"public monitor, self-censorship, social movement, news media, Umbrella Movement","This article articulates the notion of“partially censored public monitor”to explicate the role and influence of the mainstream news media during largescale protest campaigns. The mainstream media are agents of social control. In Hong Kong, political transformation also led to the problem of media self-censorship. But on the other hand, factors such as the internal diversity of the media system and journalistic professionalism have stopped the media from becoming mere servants of the powerful. This article uses a notorious incident of police violence during the Umbrella Movement as a case study. The analysis shows that public trust in the police immediately declined after the news of the incident broke out. This illustrates the public monitor function of the media. But at the same time, many mainstream news media did try to undermine the significance of the incident, and there is indeed a positive relationship between trust in police and mainstream media consumption at the individual level. On the whole, this article explicates how the mainstream media's public monitor function can be exercised even under the condition of partial censorship.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=66&CA_ID=530,38,2016,Communication & Society

"The Evolution of Hakka Symbolic Code ngang giang (""stiff neck""): A Longitudinal Analysis of Newspapers in Taiwan","Huei-Ling LAI, Chao-Lin LIU","symbolic code, iconographic reference, metaphor/metonymy, semiotic innovation, socio-cultural frames","This study investigates the innovative development of a symbolic code ngang giang (""stiff neck"") into an iconographic reference, profiling its meaning representation and diffusion in media discourse. Employing text-analysis tools, the study retrieves 3,265 tokens from the four major newspapers in Taiwan, Knowledge Management Winner, Udndata, Liberty Times Net, and Apple Daily. The data are analyzed regarding their longitudinal distribution, theme distribution, and cross distribution across four dimensions. The main findings are as follows. First, the meaning of ngang giang, which used to have a negative connotation, has turned into a symbolic code with a positive connotation due to a historical event contingent on the socio-political development in Taiwan. Even since, denoting Hakka character as perseverance, it has become a Hakka symbolic code stereotypically employed to depict Hakka-related matters—whether human and non-human—strongly indicating an ideological effect in media discourse toward Hakka groups. Its frequency highly correlates with major political events in Taiwan, with high peaks occurring 2 or 3 years before presidential elections. Second, its semiotic innovation continues to develop, extending from a prototypical Hakka frame to a Hakka non-human frame, a non-Hakka frame, and on to a non-Hakka nonhuman frame through mechanisms of denotational extensions, metonymy, and metaphor. With new ways of representing various themes ranging from international affairs, publicities in entertainment or sports, and technology to stock and money currency, ngangiang emerges as an iconographic reference representing a simplistic image with familiar judgment and values and carrying linguistic, semantic, affective, and pragmatic forces of the discourse situation reported in the news. This study demonstrates research integrating computational and corpus methods for linguistic analysis of news discourse. The findings profile the importance of placing semiotic innovation in its social, cultural, political, and historical contexts, highlighting the intertwining complexities between media discourse, communication, and society.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=67&CA_ID=532,39,2017,Communication & Society

Increasing public understanding of science through scientific popularization has become particularly important today. The development of new communication technology has resulted in a new scientific popularization movement across the Taiwan Strait. This study takes Guokr.com (Mainland China) and PanSci.tw (Taiwan) as examples and uses content analysis to compare the different features of the two science communication websites. It also explores the effects of these features on the science communication process. The results show that articles posted on the two websites differ significantly in terms of science themes, headline vividness, article vividness, interactivity, and credibility. The science themes on both websites are diverse. While both emphasize medicine and humanities, Guokr.com is more concerned about biology, medicine, and earth science, while PanSci.tw is more concerned about physics, information science, and mathematics. The differences reflect the dissimilar development of subjects in the two societies. Moreover, articles and headlines on PanSci.tw are more vivid, whereas authors on Guokr.com are more interactive. Compared to those on Guokr.com, articles on PanSci.tw also place greater emphasis on diverse opinions from various sources. The findings reflect the management models of the two websites as well as the different kinds of progress of their respective civil societies.

Reconsidering the Measures of Social Capital in Modern China and Examining Its Relationships with Different Communication Channels,"Yalong JIANG, Bolin CAO","social capital, communication channels, China","Chinese scholars often conceptualize social capital as personal social networks, which include kinsfolk, friends, and acquaintances, while non-Chinese scholars define social capital as organizational participation. In view of the social transformation in contemporary China, we propose in this article that social capital in the context of contemporary China should both include traditional guanxi and organizational social capital. Relying on the rational choice theory, we argue that the usage of communication channels is likely associated with the accumulation of social capital. Data were retrieved from a Chinese general social survey in 2006, and the results revealed that the organizational social capital that Chinese people possessed was generally far lower than the social capital in their traditional guanxi social network. Different communication channels were all significantly associated with both Chinese people's guanxi and organizational social capital, but with different directions and valences. Compared with online communication channels, the usage of offline channels can contribute to accumulating more guanxi social network. On the other hand, communicating online can lead to greater accumulation of organizational social capital than communicating offline. The implications of this study are discussed.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=67&CA_ID=535,39,2017,Communication & Society

We see the emergence of @PD as the party's response to the rise of new forms of media, and recognize its potential impact on the traditional party propaganda system. This study aimed to explore whether such news platforms represent the adaptation of a new communication model, and if so, how. We also sought to interpret the observations within the context of party adaption. By analyzing @PD's coverage of two important issues, we found that @PD makes strategic adjustments to both their coverage paradigm and rhetoric modes, as well as discourse connotation, revealing a new communication model that can solve the internal conflict that arises from serving the people and the party at the same time. With this communication model—utilized in conjunction with more traditional modes of party communication—the party is thus able to establish a two-tiered communication system aimed at re-establishing its hegemony in a new media realm. This adaption of party media can be seen as enhancing the resilience of the Chinese authoritarian regime.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=67&CA_ID=536,39,2017,Communication & Society

On the Disciplinary Legitimacy of Public Relations in Mainland China: A Comparative Perspective,Yi-Hui Christine HUANG,"public relations, discipline legitimacy, public relations education, public relations industry, comparative study","A tug of war to establish public relations (PR) as a legitimate academic discipline has occurred in both the United States and Mainland China. Scholars in the American and Chinese PR discipline have encountered similar challenges in the early stage of discipline development. The current status as a result of development in the two contexts, however, presents a surprising contrast. Against this background, the present study aims to investigate the issue of legitimacy underlying the PR discipline. In particular, the author builds an analytical framework by incorporating the dimensions of PR education, industry practice, and academic research. With the mirror of the PR discipline development in the Western academic context, the positioning of the Chinese PR discipline is discussed. A dual-case study approach is adopted to compare and contrast the different development of the PR discipline in the United States and Mainland China. This study proposes that the collective academic community in the Chinese PR discipline and the underdeveloped intellectual associations and research publishing platforms have led the Chinese PR discipline to lag behind. More importantly, the lack of improvement in the discipline's research ability remains the deepest reason limiting the legitimate claim for the Chinese PR discipline. The findings indicate that the Chinese PR discipline research tends to reflect (1) a narrow scope of research, (2) features a lack of method triangulation (qualitative methods were mostly used as the only method), (3) is practically oriented and non-empirical without theoretical advancement, (4) lacks primary data and appropriate citation of references, and (5) shows a lack of diverse publishing channels.

Communication Technology and New Media Events,"Jack Linchuan QIU, Joseph Man CHAN, Zhifei MAO",,"This special issue of Communication and Society consists of six articles that examine the ongoing social, technological, political, and cultural dynamics in China's Internet-facilitated media events. Following the 2009 special issue of Communication and Society on ""new media events"" (Issue 9), this current issue continues to interrogate questions of power, online discourse, and structures of feeling / emotions, but under new technological conditions (e.g., mobile Internet) and new institutional settings (e.g., Beijing's centralized efforts of Internet control). It breaks new grounds by deploying digital methods (e.g., data mining of Weibo), broadening the empirical scope of analysis (e.g., connecting new and old media), and developing key concepts tailored to the Chinese contexts (e.g., yuqing or public opinion under the auspices of government control) but with global relevance (e.g., ""agenda diversity""). Among the 12 authors who wrote these 6 articles, 5 were graduate students currently studying in mainland China or the USA. This is an important indicator about the vitality of this research field with notable emerging scholarship. Most important, technological improvement cannot be equated with sociopolitical and institutional progress.

Yuqing: A Native Chinese Concept and Its Practice,"Yong HU, Qiuxin CHEN","public opinion, yuqing, yuqing monitoring system, social control","With the emergence and popularization of the Internet, China has slowly developed a public sphere of ""Internet public opinion"" in parallel with and counterbalancing the so-called ""mainstream public opinion."" However, in the highly centralized Chinese society, this alternative force has provoked the Party to tighten its control over speech by invent ingenious methods of micro social management. This increased control has led to the emergence of yuqing studies and a thriving yuqing industry of intelligence, surveillance, and policing agencies that monitor the ""sentiments"" of online public opinion. The monstrous yuqing monitoring system has transformed from gathering intelligence and analyzing ""social conditions and public opinion"" to manipulating and fabricating public opinion on the Internet. The yuqing system has ""successfully"" constructed an orderly and harmonious cyberspace in which positive ""public opinions"" are expressed. However, in doing so, it has brushed aside and buried real online public opinions about issues and conflicts between and among regions, social classes, religions, ethnicities, the state, and society. The operations of the yuqing monitoring system reflect the paradox of China's Internet management regime: there is more information available to average Internet users but less authenticity in the sentiments expressed. The change in lexicon and practice from yulun to yuqing is a result of the change in China's information governance and social management. By using yuqing, the Party-State intends to keep pace with the times to promote good governance at all levels. However, yuqing has been used to quell dissent, not express fundamental changes based on the ""sentiments"" of the masses. The monitoring of yuqing has become an organized mechanism of social control. It serves the needs of the Party and government to contain and even eliminate public opinion.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=68&CA_ID=541,40,2017,Communication & Society
Killing Emotions Softly: The Civilizing Process of Online Emotional Mobilization,Guobin YANG,"emotional mobilization, civility, Internet event, new media event, Internet censorship","Since 2013, contention-oriented Internet events have been increasingly transformed into consensus-oriented new media events in the Chinese cyberspace. The direct cause of this transformation is the obstruction of online emotional mobilization. The main emotions expressed in online mobilization, such as sympathy, anger, and playfulness, have been increasingly labeled and attacked as negative, irrational, and uncivil. The key condition surrounding the demobilization of online emotions is a set of new policies that are centered on the concepts of civility and civilization as well as the new social environment in which these policies are implemented. The practice of regulating the Internet in the name of civility constitutes a civilizing process. This process has undermined emotional mobilization online, leading to the weakening of contentious online activism in China in the past few years.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=68&CA_ID=542,40,2017,Communication & Society
New Media Event in Collective Memory (2002–2014): A Perspective on Sentiment Analysis,"Zhijin ZHONG, Shujin LIN, Xueyan LIU, Yaqin YANG","collective memory, emotion, new media event","New media events have become an important topic of research that explores the influence of the Internet on Chinese society. This quantitative study applies the collective memory theory, the emotion theory, and the discourse opportunity theory to examine new media events. The users of social media are also the writers of collective memory, and the discourse on social media could be seen as comprising the text of collective memory. When people discuss a specific new media event, they express their own emotions, which they share with their social networks online. We built a new media event database including 262 important new media events from 2002 to 2014, and we coded the types and outcomes of the events. We then collected data from Sina Weibo using the keywords of the events on Python. We used LIWC, a software that is widely implemented in sentiment analyses, to obtain interesting findings. First, the more that a specific event was reported by conventional media, the more it was discussed on social media. Second, different types of new media events produced different impressions and emotions in the collective memory. Specifically, events that were characterized by citizen advocacy and nationalism were the most likely to elicit positive emotions. Accidents, disasters, and events related to food and drug safety were the most frequently mentioned. Events that were related to crime and social security were the most likely to provoke negative emotions, especially anger and anxiety. Accidents and natural disasters elicited the most sadness in the collective memory. However, new media events caused by structural contradictions or the injustice of the society were not discussed frequently, which was an unexpected finding. The results suggest that people care more about the events that are close to their daily lives than events that reflect social problems. The results also indicated that topics about social structure or social institutions are politically risky, which reduced the amount of related discourse on social media. Furthermore, the outcomes of new media events were also related to emotions in the collective memory. When the events caused the death of people or changed the policies or decisions of the government, they raised feelings of anger in the collective memory, while the fall of officials reduced such feelings. Anxiety existed in the collective memory of events caused death or imprisonment. The events that increase social support elicited sadness in the collective memory although the outcome was positive.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=68&CA_ID=543,40,2017,Communication & Society
Exploring Agenda Diversity in New Media Events: A Comparative Study of 12 Newspapers across China,"Baohua ZHOU, Shuning LU","new media event, agenda diversity, journalistic paradigm, China","Mainstream journalism has reacted to the proliferation of new media events in China. The current study focuses on agenda diversity as a core concept in the systematic analysis of the content of the news coverage of new media events (N = 2,534) reported in 12 Chinese newspapers. The findings revealed that new media events, which are sometimes regarded as controversial and sensitive issues in China, were largely incorporated into the news coverage by mainstream newspapers. However, the manner in which the newspapers covered such events was limited, unstable, and fragmented, depending on the newspapers' socio-geographic locations and journalistic paradigms. In terms of internal diversity, newspapers in eastern China covered more diverse new media events than those in western and central China covered. Moreover, the internal diversity of new media events covered by the party media lagged behind those covered by market-oriented media. Furthermore, the discrepancy of internal diversity between party and market-oriented newspapers in the same locality was much greater in central or western China than in eastern China. The analysis of external diversity revealed a fragmented pattern, more than four-fifths of all 1,488 new media events were reported by only one newspaper. The newspapers in western and central China showed higher external diversity than those in eastern China. Market-oriented newspapers were more likely to converge in terms of their coverage of new media events, issues, and types than party newspapers were.

Feeling Other’s Pain: Subaltern,Guangfeng YUAN,"compassion, pain, deliberative democracy, left-behind children, public sphere, subaltern","The problem of ""left-behind"" children has been an important issue in contemporary China. This group's pain aroused a ""moral shock"" and public compassion in some public events. Two case studies are used to examine the representation of this subaltern group's pain in mass media and the public expression of compassion in cyberspace from the perspective of deliberative democracy theory. Mass media represent the pain of left-behind children through the language of agency, and they play an important role in making their pain a public issue. The public compassion aroused by subaltern pain has been an important motivation for public expression, which is structured by emotions such as sorrow, anger, satire, shame, and powerlessness. Netizens use both official and cultural discourses to express compassion. These findings are valuable because they contribute to considering the moral and emotional dimensions in the formation of the public sphere. Subalterns' pain is rarely expressed in the public sphere because of the inequality of political power, which inevitably leads to compassion fatigue.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=68&CA_ID=546,40,2017,Communication & Society
Chinese Communication Journals in the Digital Age: Development and Challenges,"Moderators: Joseph M. CHAN, Yu HUANG",,"This is a roundtable attended by editors of the major communication journals published in the Chinese societies of mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. The first set of topics pertains to the organization and operation of the journals, including their positioning, review system, status of submissions, criteria for acceptance, setup of special issues, and the impact of citation statistics on the journals. Most journals have already adopted the double-blind review method. The journals differ in how they combine academic and practical pursuits and whether they follow their governments' policy concerns. The inclusion of journals in citation databanks is the trend to come. It serves to enhance a journal's competitiveness as a venue for quality articles. The second set of topics relates to the challenges facing the journals, the trend of studies, and the changing roles of journals in the digital age. One common problem facing the journals is the difficulty in the solicitation of reviewers. There is no question that digital media studies have become an overwhelming subject for communication researchers. Many editors agree that conceptual and theoretical contribution of such studies remain to be articulated. They are also concerned about how the journals can ride on the digital tide to improve themselves in terms of openness, timeliness and accessibility.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=547,41,2017,Communication & Society
Communication Personalness and Mobilization: Are Social Media More Effective Than Personal Contacts and Mass Media?,Chen-Chao TAO,"communication personalness, political consumerism, social conformity hypothesis, strong-tie hypothesis, weak-tie hypothesis","Personal networks and media are viewed as the most influential channels for social movement mobilization. Interestingly, social media play both roles, but whether they achieve the same effect of mobilization is unknown. Regarding personal networks, research has shown that being asked by acquaintances through personal contact (i.e., face-to-face and telephone) is the key determinant of social movement participation. This study used a Web survey to investigate the relationship between the channel of mobilization and participation in the context of political consumerism in Taiwan. The results showed that being asked through personal contact was still the most effective predictor of social movement participation. The results showed that mass media had no effects. Social media also failed to influence social movement participation. Although personal networks in social media are large, few members actually mobilize others to participate in social movements because they fear public disclosure of their personal political stance, and most users have weak ties. These factors lead to the ineffectiveness of appealing through personal networks on social media.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=548,41,2017,Communication & Society
Heteroglossia in Social Media during the Hong Kong Umbrella Movement: Exploring Multi-language Tweets,"Yu-Chung CHENG, Pai-Lin CHEN","social media, Umbrella Movement, Twitter, multi-language, social movement, civil disobedience","In 2014, the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong arose from the protests of student activists against the implementation of the new electoral system, which evolved into civil disobedience. Similar to the Sunflower Movement in Taiwan a few months earlier, the Chinese factor influenced the Umbrella Movement, which drew the attention of Taiwanese and Chinese communities overseas. Through the coverage by Western media, global citizens became aware of the Umbrella Movement, which Time Magazine deemed the most important global event of 2014. We analyzed 1.6 million tweets about the Umbrella Movement, which were posted on the social media platform Twitter between August and December 2014. We aimed to compare the discussions of this movement by Twitter users in different language communities in order to characterize the differences in the modes of communication among the Hong Kong community, the English-speaking community, and the Chinese community. This study yielded two main findings. First, the foci of attention to the Umbrella Movement in the foreign (English-speaking) community occurred mainly at the beginning and the end of the protest. Most English-speaking users participated by retweeting the posts in international media. In contrast, the local community's participation was continuous. Furthermore, many local users created original content, such as personal comments, hyperlinks, and photographs, which were indicated the participants' autonomy in this networked movement. Second, multi-language users acted as bridges in the social networks. Because these users were connected to people in different countries, the posts on their personal networks were disseminated worldwide through social media.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=549,41,2017,Communication & Society

In this research, we investigated the content of microblog posts. Among the different characteristics of microblogs, we focused on emotional content in order to shed light on how they contribute to causing microblog messages to go viral. In study 1, we investigated the relationship between microblog emotionality and information diffusion. In study 2, we explored the psychological mechanism by which microblog emotionality influences information diffusion. Finally, in study 3 we further examined the moderator between microblog emotionality and information diffusion. Our findings showed that the larger the proportion of emotional words in a microblog post text, the more often it was retweeted. Affective involvement (the state of arousal) mediated the relationship between microblog emotionality and information diffusion. In addition, cognitive involvement (self-relevance of the message) moderated the relationship between emotionality and information diffusion. Specifically, highly self-relevant messages with high emotionality were the most likely to be retweeted.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=550,41,2017,Communication & Society
What Technological Controversies Do You Sing? The Implications for Democratization of the Science Knowledge Communicated by Taiwan’s Anti-Nuke Movement Singers,Chun-Ju HUANG,"technological controversy, boundary object, anti-nuke movement, science knowledge democratization","In recent decades, an increasing number of cultural workers and artists have joined social movements centered on technological controversies to inspire the participants' enthusiasm. Cultural performance not only motivates the public's concern about social events but also plays the role of a ""boundary object"" to improve the public's discussions about related issues. These phenomena are investigated in a case study of the anti-nuke movement in Taiwan. The data were collected in-depth interviews with singers, participant observations, lyrics, and video archives. The process by which the singers participated in the movement was analyzed, and the democratized science knowledge they possessed was categorized. The categories of democratized science knowledge included political skepticism, risk probability, life philosophy, reflections about technological development, and division of labor. The results showed that the reasons that the singers participated in the movement included long-term concerns about the social movement, the stimulation of the context of the event, and friendship networks. These results indicate that if the cultural performance in a social movement centered on technological controversy involved predictable knowledge, negotiable knowledge, and expandable knowledge, the democratization of science knowledge would be enhanced and socially robust knowledge could be constructed in a proactive and positive manner.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=551,41,2017,Communication & Society

The purpose of the study is to analyze the link between gendered power and tourism by exploring the representations of female travelers in mass media, tourist guidebooks, and the life experiences of female travelers. In the 1980s, female travelers in Taiwan were represented as passive tourists with fragile bodies. As a female space, travel was portrayed as risky and fraught with sexual temptation. However, the discourse has changed. For female travelers, the space of tourism has become a source of knowledge, enjoyment, and confidence. Women relate their own experiences of travel. The heteroglossia of Taiwanese women's travel discourses constitutes a terrain of identity construction in the medial discourses of gender and tourism.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=552,41,2017,Communication & Society

The purpose of the study is to expand the perspective of communication in order to present a comprehensive description. In the presence of universal values of culture and interactions between different cultures, the interality of intercultural dialog is developed in the process of intercultural communication. In this regard, the essence of intercultural communication can be deemed a process of achieving interality through cultural dialog, negotiation, and adjustment between different cultures. The formation of intercultural dialog is a complex process of isomorphism and acculturation, which is characterized by unique mechanisms of construction and perfection. Such dialog plays a key role in enhancing the effectiveness of intercultural communication. In this study, the processes, mechanisms, features, and influencing factors of its construction and perfection are briefly analyzed. The practical manifestation of this concept is exemplified by the interality of intercultural dialog in the ""rest zone"" in office buildings of multinational corporations.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=69&CA_ID=553,41,2017,Communication & Society

One sample selected in this study is the official press conference script released by President Ma Ying-jeou, which is compared with the response letter the student movement group later released, the other is the propaganda and press conference script released by the MOEA, which is intended to refute the discourse made by the opponents against the Cross-Strait Agreement on Trade in Services (CSATS). Through the approaches of simple word frequency analysis and the critical discourse analysis suggested by Ruth Wodak, this research examine the self-reference, calls for identity, the construction of the other, the ideologies manipulation, frame setting and other operations from relevant texts. The findings show a sharp contrast between President Ma Yingjeou and the student movement group's discursive strategies, both statements having no intention to engage in dialogue but choosing to reach out to the general public. However, as far as their discursive strategies are concerned, President Ma Ying-jeou stressed the ""Taiwan must not be marginalized"" discourse from the perspective of globalization, while the student movement group emphasized the discursive strategy of ""decision-making is inside the black box"" from the perspective of democratic procedure, as for the MOEA's discursive strategy, the focus lied in refuting the discourse of the opponents against CSATS, attempting to prove their claims being mere lies. Despite the MOEA's attempt to cite factual proof to argue the claims of the opponents against CSATS being absurd mistakes, within the framing strategy, the replication of the framework of the opponents against CSATS diluted the potency of the persuasion the MOEA had originally anticipated.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=70&CA_ID=556,42,2017,Communication & Society

In particular, the credibility upon which its claims to legitimacy and authority rest has suffered. Credibility has long been regarded as an important concept in normative journalism theories, and it plays a central role in regulating media behavior and ethics. Based on a comprehensive study of six print media organizations and 92 in-depth interviews with journalists and media managers, conducted between 2016 and 2017, this research finds that credibility is today used as a marketing tool helping newspaper groups survive the current economic crisis. Rather than being a normative tool regulating ethics, media credibility has become more of an economic tool serving market ends. Chinese media organizations tend to exploit the market potential of media credibility in three main ways: the reconfiguration of organizational structures, the expansion of “side businesses”, and a redefinition of journalistic roles. The paper demonstrates that the wide adoption of these strategies has profound implications for the reshaping of media ecology, and raises important issues regarding the transformation of media and journalism in the new era.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=71&CA_ID=569,43,2018,Communication & Society

The results were as follows: (1) response content was more important than response form, media selection, and spokesperson level, (2) the crisis managers preferred the justification strategy, (3) regarding response, timeliness was the key sub-factor in victim and accident crises. However, activeness was the most important sub-factor in preventable crises, (4) Taiwan’s crisis managers stated that television was the key media channel that should be adopted, (5) the type of crisis had moderating effects on the factor ratings of crisis communication strategies and on the sub-factors of both response forms and media selection. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings for crisis communication are discussed.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=72&CA_ID=574,44,2018,Communication & Society
Online Community in the “Floating Life”: An Anthropological Study of the Use of Social Media among the New Generation of Chinese Rural Migrants,Xinyuan WANG,"social media, social network, online community, floating population, modernity","Based on a 15-month (2013–2014) ethnographical study that was conducted in a small factory town in Zhejiang province, China, this project explores the daily use of social media among the new generation of Chinese rural migrants as well as the social effects of social media and the social transformations in contemporary China. Drawing from field work conducted both offline and online, this paper focuses on the construction of community in the floating life of Chinese rural migrants and the ways new social relations and communication patterns develop using social media. In their ""floating life"" of rural-to-urban migration, rural migrants face crises in terms of interpersonal relations and the sense of belonging. The findings showed that by using social media, these migrants created a relatively stable and ideal social life. Their online community had become an essential part—a new ""dwelling place""—of the migrants’ lives. The social media use among the new generation of rural migrants is a new interpretation of ""networked individualism.""",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=72&CA_ID=575,44,2018,Communication & Society

The research not only explored residents’ attitudes toward community-based intervention but also investigated the effectiveness of the intervention “Chatting in front of the Temple” on health promotion among residents in these rural communities. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, attempts were made to conduct community-based health promotion interventions from the perspective of cultural sensitivity. Health promotion practitioners in 16 communities in Chia- Yi Country and entertainment education strategies were employed to motivate residents to engage in health promotion behavior. When the “Chatting in front of the Temple” activity started, community residents sang karaoke, ate dinner, and danced before sitting in front of the temple to learn about health promotion. The health promotion practitioners in the activity also developed some interesting materials (e.g., animation, pictures, and videos) to pique the residents’ interest. In the second phase of the research, a qualitative study using face-to-face interviews with 19 community residents who participated in the “Chatting in front of the Temple” activity was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based health promotion interventions. The findings of the study showed that the participants regarded the plaza of the temple an effective location for health practitioners to impart messages related to health promotion to community residents. The residents preferred easy-to-understand information regarding health promotion through entertainment-based activities. The residents emphasized that the “Chatting in front of the Temple” intervention reflected the government’s increasing recognition of the significant role of culture as a factor that is associated with health behaviors.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=72&CA_ID=576,44,2018,Communication & Society
Teaching and Researching Communication in Mainland China,"Leonard L. CHU, Yan WANG",,"This exchange summarizes decades of Leonard L. Chu's reflections on teaching and researching communication in Mainland China. Chu, who is a veteran educator of journalism and communication, is professor emeritus at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. Chu's family background epitomizes many in contemporary China. Known for his grasp of comparative media systems, international communication, and media in Mainland China, Chu has taught at universities in Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan for 40 years. His numerous publications on education in Chinese media and journalism have influenced many young communication scholars in the pan-Chinese region. In 2012, Chu's contributions to this field won him the fourth Master Hsing Yun Journalism and Communication Education Award. For the Chinese Communication Society's annual convention in 2016, Chu organized a panel entitled Teaching Mainland China Media at Overseas Universities. At the panel, he ruled out the possibility of a universally applicable model for course organizers although he revealed that he used a socio-historical approach. Quoting communication doyen Wilbur Schramm and pioneer psychologist Lewin Kurt, Chu stated that he is convinced of the practical benefits of theory. Indeed, he said that he encourages his students to apply theory in organizing the myriad of information about China's media, which is scattered among various academic disciplines.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=73&CA_ID=577,45,2018,Communication & Society
Power and Information Paradox: A State Perspective on Studying Chinese Media,Fen LIN,"information empowerment, information paradox, power, state–media relations, authoritarian regime","“Information empowerment” has been a key part of investigating media transition in authoritarian regimes. Although the market and communication technology open the door to an abundant and diverse range of information, these two factors are not adequate to explain the “information paradox” that has occurred during the Chinese media transition. Marketization and technology allow for relatively more journalistic autonomy, but they have also brought new forms of journalistic conservatism. Meanwhile, the authoritarian state has tightened its control over mass media when its power is challenged by the increasing availability of information. Therefore, this article takes a state perspective to explain how China is handling the challenges of the information age. Modifying the “information conflicts” model proposed by Lin (2012), I investigate the multiple dimensions of power and update the typology of state–media dynamics. I argue that marketization results in a greater diversity of information, but it also differentiating different types of information, which facilitates the power transition in state–media relations. As a result, media controls in China have shifted from a single-to a multi-dimensional structure that offers temporary institutional resilience against the challenges of the information era.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=73&CA_ID=578,45,2018,Communication & Society

They are also likely to outperform conventional media because of their instant communication of a vast variety of voices. Considering the fundamental differences between social media and conventional media, this paper seeks to answer the following questions regarding Taiwan’s Ting Hsin tainted oil crisis in 2014: Did the coverage of the 2014 Ting Hsin tainted oil crisis vary according to its duration in traditional media and social media? What sources and topics were reported in traditional media and social media? Were different tones conveyed in the traditional media and social media that covered the crisis? We conducted a content analysis of 1,480 news articles collected from four major newspapers in Taiwan and 203 posts collected from six Facebook fan pages. Our findings indicate that the amount of converge on social media and conventional media indeed varied over time. Moreover, social media and conventional media tended to utilize different types of information sources and stress disparate topics. Significantly, when the coverage referred to the Taiwanese government as well as the food suppliers, conspicuous discrepancies in tone were conveyed by the social media and the conventional media.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=73&CA_ID=579,45,2018,Communication & Society

The hierarchical arrangement of these concepts has significant effects on the rules of exchange and the willingness to help. The actions of acquaintances are characterized by a long-term orientation, whereas those of strangers are characterized by a short-term orientation. In most cases, the outcomes of the rationality of guanxi and the individual’s reasoning are very different.

The Politics of Naming: Some Reflections on the Construction of Chinese Marriage Immigrants and Nationalism in Taiwan’s Media,Yun-Er ZHU,"Chinese marriage immigrants, corpus-based qualitative content analysis, nationalism, frame analysis","Chinese marriage immigrants to Taiwan from Mainland China are targets of Taiwanese nationalism. In news reports, these immigrants are referred to under four different names—Mainland spouses, Chinese spouses, Mainland brides, and Chinese brides—each of which represents different social norms and dreams of segmentation or integration. In this study, we analyze news reports about Chinese marriage immigrants in four major newspapers from 2003 to 2014. The innovative method of corpus-based qualitative content analysis is applied, which integrates natural language processing techniques into traditional content analysis. The objective is to determine the distinctive naming strategies adopted by media organizations. The results show that the discourse structures of Mainland Chinese brides are more constrained and less sophisticated compared with those of their “Mainland Chinese spouses.” Moreover, this discourse centers on national defense strategies. In addition, the term “crime frames” is used frequently news about brides, stigmatizing them as “evil brides.” In contrast, news about “Mainland spouses” is significantly influenced by “social integration and social welfare frames” and constructs them as “model spouses,” which are further revealed to be part of governmental propaganda plans. “Model spouses” and “evil brides” are opposite but complementary sides of nationalism, disciplining Chinese marriage immigrants to be self-sacrificing, submissive, and loyal.

The mechanism of the internal relations between these three variables was also investigated. The results revealed that the relation between cognitive social capital and self-rated health was positive, whereas no significant relation was found between structural social capital and self-rated health. The effects of Internet usage on social capital were mixed. Briefly, Internet learning, Internet working, Internet socializing, and Internet commercial activities had positive effects on social capital, while Internet entertainment reduced social capital. For urban participants, both the mediating and moderating mechanisms of the relationship between social capital, Internet usage, and self-rated health existed. For rural participants, the moderating mechanism was observed.

Media Credibility in the Public Mind: A Critique,Zhongshi GUO,"Media credibility, Hong Kong newspaper, political participation, dormant perceptions, trust","This study contests the three main assumptions that precede traditional studies of public perceptions of media credibility: (1) universally shared meaning of credibility, (2) audience rational evaluation of media performance using credibility as a core criterion, and (3) perceived credibility as a necessary condition for political participation. In building the case against the centrality of perceived media credibility in political communication scholarship, this critique also draws academic attention to the possibility that much of the findings in existing literature may be a methodological artifact because respondents have been primed to narrow their assessment of media within a set of normative and socially desirable measures. To address some of these issues, we conducted a face-to-face depth interview on 24 Hong Kong newspaper readers. We found that when unprimed, (1) credibility has minimum salience or is dormant in the public mind, (2) interviewees were quick to elicit post hoc rationalization strategies to achieve balance and reduce dissonance created by the gap between the paper they read most often and the paper they deem to be the most credible, (3) people seldom rely fully on rational routes of reasoning to assess media.

No Landscape on the Road: Communication in City Mobile Spaces,Donglei BIAN,"transportation, city, mobile space, communication","This article provides a critical examination of the effects of mobile technology on urban communication. In this article, it is argued that the modern transportation system, which was invented in the 19th century, is an autonomous technology. The logic of “rapid flow” has changed the nature of the city and created a mobile space where special interactions occur. Roads, overpasses, and tunnels constitute the city’s appearance, but permanent accommodation is difficult. In context, mobile space is populated by strangers, which leads to “avoid communication” relationships. Remarkably, with the emergence of mobile phones, although being “present without interaction” has become acceptable, the negative relationships in mobile space are exacerbated. Hence, there is no landscape on the road. Ruled by mobile technology, it is impossible to avoid the effects of mobile technology. Users try to move faster, stay at home, or create an alternative space. However, because of the decreasing opportunities to stay, walk, and chat in public spaces, people are not optimistic about the positive aspects of public life.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=78&CA_ID=595,47,2019,Communication & Society

The data were collected from an online survey and in-depth interviews. The results showed that LINE is currently the most commonly used technology for long-distance family communication in Taiwan. However, the choice of technologies for parent-child communication may vary depending upon the purpose, content, location, and occasion of contacts. The findings also showed that structural solidarity (i.e., geographic proximity and number of family members) and normative solidarity (i.e., strength of filial obligations) were found to be strongly related to association solidarity (i.e., frequency of contact).

This study, based on an online ethnography survey of the elderly in Wuhan, Hubei Province and a county in western Hubei, tries to explore what the new possibilities the mobile social media have supplied for the social interaction practices and the social re-embedding of the “the old drifters”. The study finds that the WeChat groups based on “square dance groups” provide the entrance for “the old drifters” to arrive in the cities and to establish new relationships. They gain the warmth of “sisterhood” in the online communities, through the WeChat groups. Besides, their past social relationships broken in their hometowns due to mobility also can be carried by WeChat, gaining a continuous connection and “a mobile sense of place”. They also use eChat during returning to native lands to coordinate the tension among their different states of transfer, temporary residence and dwelling. Differing from the dominant “digital divide” paradigm, this study displays how the elderly mobile population, who is often considered to be a marginal group in political-economic structure and in internet use, utilizes the mediation of new communication technologies to cope with dilemmas and difficulties in social relations.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=78&CA_ID=597,47,2019,Communication & Society

It explores the ways in which technology has both connected drivers in mobile work and embedded them in relationship networks resulting from their work, thus exposing social tension. The analysis of data collected through in-depth interviews and non-participatory observations showed the following three main findings. First, mobile work is temporally flexible. Drivers can choose when and how long to work, and most see working on the car-hailing platform as a transitional phrase. However, because of the interaction between the method by which the car-hailing platform assigns job and the socioeconomic status of the drivers, this this is a pseudo-flexibility. Second, temporally, the distribution of resources and the control of labor are achieved by means of technological development. For drivers, the system and its algorithm have become the new overlord and ultimate arbitrator. They are placed inside the system, and their labor is constantly being monitored, but they also have a high level of trust in and dependence on technology. Third, in terms of relationship structure, mobile device-mediated interactions between platforms and drivers have obscured the rights and responsibilities of both parties. In the process, responsibilities and risks are transferred from the platform to individual drivers. However, the results indicated that drivers have passive attitudes toward the situation, and collective actions are not taken.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=78&CA_ID=598,47,2019,Communication & Society
Social Relations in Mobility: Effects of Mobile Telephony on the Social Capital of Delivery Workers in Shanghai,Yupu ZHANG,"delivery workers in Shanghai, mobile telephony, social capital, rural-urban migration, mobility","The dual roles of delivery workers as “rural-urban migrants” and “mobile workers” affect their mobile social practice. Mobile telephony exposes them to the constant use of mobile telephony in coordinating with “mobility,” which is called the process of “online compliance.” Long working hours also contribute to their frequent use of mobile telephony in daily routines. Survey data self-reported by 302 delivery workers in Shanghai, China indicated that the use of social-oriented mobile telephony and work-oriented mobile telephony use is significantly positively correlated with bonding social capital. However, no correlation was found between these two types of telephony and bridging social capital. The results also showed a strong association between the need for family affiliation and the motivations for maintaining rural social relationships and initiating urban social relationships. The need for urban affiliation was strongly associated with the motivation for initiating urban social relationships. The results also showed that both motivations were significantly correlated to mobile telephony use. However, no correlation was found between communication skills and social capital. The workers’ affiliation with family and their hometowns were strengthened by using mobile telephony. Delivery workers also developed social capital through media interactions in their mobile work. However, it had a negligible impact on the accumulation of social capital, which means that delivery workers are too busy to take a further step in the transformation of their social relationships by using mobile telephony.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=78&CA_ID=599,47,2019,Communication & Society

The findings come from 69 in-depth interviews with journalists, journalists’ self-reports, and relevant state policy materials, drawing on Abbott’s jurisdictional conflicts theory and ecological perspective. Chinese journalists are not homogeneous. It is a profession including different “segments” divided by technological and political logics. The state employs partition management toward different “emerging groups” of journalists appeared in the technological transformation. This study focuses on three major segments: journalists in traditional media, journalists in internet giants, and their counterparts in news startups brought by the development of mobile communication technologies. No doubt technology made nature cracks among journalists, but collaboration and migration among three tribes may bring professionalism to different technological platforms. However, the partition management from the state, via three channels: licensure, media affiliation, and economic support, has shaped different strategies taking by different journalist segments in jurisdictional conflicts, further deepening the gaps across different segments.

The “State-Media” Relationship in China within the De-Western Context: The State’s Function’s Disconnection and Connection on Watchdog Journalism,Bing WANG,"de-Western context, the function of the state, watchdog journalism, state expression, social expression","In the Western context, the media freedom and media’s watchdog function reveals the binary opposition relationship between the state and the media, and firmly oppose the intervention of the state. In an authoritarian regime such as China, although the state is regarded as the dominant controlling force of the media, it is actively promoting the development of critical reports. The state undertakes the function of promoters and supporters of critical reports. Therefore, the relationship between the “state” and the media is not a simple opposition, which presents a more complex and tortuous relationship. This study aims to explore how the function of China’s “state” in the context of the West goes to the critical report. In this study, it is found that the relationship between the state and the media, which is reflected in the critical reports in the Chinese context, is a kind of coordination, promotion and control. Behind this relationship, the function of the state is changing in the process of promoting and controlling critical reports, and the change of this kind of function presents a kind of dynamic process of “rupture and continuity.” The change of the function of the country depends on the change of the attitude of the country in different historical periods, whether the media is preferred “state expression” and “social expression.”",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=79&CA_ID=604,48,2019,Communication & Society

This study tries to describe and analyze this phenomenon. The study examines the news content of one exemplary section, “Net-Eye” of Southern Metropolitan. Through content analysis, the study finds that the news content of “Press-Internet Interaction Section” only shows limited publicness as other Chinese media. The results indicate that the possibility provided by the Internet to increase the publicness of mainland China’s newspaper has been minimal within established power structures.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=79&CA_ID=603,48,2019,Communication & Society
Relationship Maintenance Mode of After Service Failure Recovery: “Stewardship” Perspective,Cheng-Tao LIU,"public relations strategy, service failure, service recovery, stewardship, relationship maintenance","This study adopts stewardship-oriented relationship maintenance mode (Hon & Grunig, 1999, Waters, 2009, 2011) as a theoretical framework in constructing relationship maintenance strategy of after service failure recovery, as well as evaluating the impact of this strategy on relationship outcomes between company and complaining customers. By randomly telephone surveying 239 respondents aged 18 and above, living in Taiwan, having filed complaints and received responses from consuming companies, the results not only found strategic considerations of “reporting,” “reciprocity” and “relationship nurturing” that can be used for constructing relationship maintenance strategy of after service failure recovery, but also further found that “reciprocity” is greater than “relationship nurturing” and “reporting” in generating positive impact on relationship outcome between company and complaining customers.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=79&CA_ID=602,48,2019,Communication & Society

Small is Beautiful? An Exploration of Viable Business Model of Media Organizations under the Lens of Attention Economy: The Case of Guangzhou,Xiaoqin LI,"attention economy, demassification of media, wisdom journalism, wisdom marketing, new media profit model","Market-oriented traditional media that emerged from China’s news reform now faces an industry crisis brought by new media. These traditional media organizations have been exploring ways to innovate and converge with new media. From 2014 to 2017, the author of this research tracked three marketoriented media outlets in Guangzhou: two life-style magazines and a media APP run by a metropolitan newspaper. Combining background document analysis, in-depth interview, and participant observation, this study examines the process of establishing a new media business model aiming at sustainable profitability. It is found that in the process of transition, the macro media system unavoidably plays a restrictive role, while the motivation to innovate and ability to execute on the part of media organization leadership are a key factor. At the micro level, the original content production based on accurate positioning of target users is positively linked to media performance and profitability, and cross-media editorial operation may have an adverse impact. From the perspective of new media attention economy, wisdom journalism and wisdom marketing are equally important in attracting users. It is still too early to say that any new media profit model is mature to established, but this research finds that media convergence is a relatively smooth path for “demassified” small media to achieve profitability. As such, demassfied media operation may become a new growth point or organic supplement in traditional media organizations in their media convergence process.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=80&CA_ID=612,49,2019,Communication & Society

Symbol Carrier and Consensus Mobilization in the Era of Image Communication: A Comprehensive Analysis of Nine Ribbon Actions,"Xiaoan GUO, Shaoting YANG","image communication, symbol carrier, consensus mobilization, ribbon action","In recent years, colored ribbons as symbol carriers have gradually increased in collective actions, appearing constantly as objects, images, languages, and collection texts. Above mentioned phenomenon has been interwoven with various functions, such as the group shaping, visual persuasion, emotional mobilization and etc., which are caused by the connection of ribbon and color. After a comprehensive analysis of the nine ribbon actions, it was found that the metaphors manufactured by the collocation of color and ribbon in collective action not only has cultural conventionality, but also has a certain degree of variability because of the different context, political opportunity structure and cognitive schema. As a tool for visual persuasion and emotional mobilization, ribbons are frequently applied in the field of consensus social movement in China, with characteristics of public welfare, morality and altruistic. Although a small number of ribbon actions are used in the field of social protest, they have certain obvious industrial and regional characteristics. Although this kind of movement can obtain a certain political discourse space to achieve online and offline linkage, the visual symbols used in the ribbon actions cannot directly display scars and pains, which have caused difficulties for the viewers to decode to a certain extent, affecting the depth and breadth of mobilization. Essentially, it is a strategic trade-off among identity restraint, self-protection, and group expression under a specific political opportunity structure.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=80&CA_ID=610,49,2019,Communication & Society

This paper tries to bridge social movement studies and deliberative governance studies by examining the potentials and limits of stakeholder’s discursive contention as deliberative participation from the theoretical perspective of deliberative democracy. Specifically, this paper explores how Wangjiang Four Seniors ( 望江四老), four retired Chinese Communist Party cadres in Wangjiang County, Anhui Province, who had been contending against the Jiangxi Pengze Nuclear Power Project shortly after Fukushima Accident in 2011, acted as an informal social organization in a way preferring peaceful and rational discursive contention other than street protest to address conflicts. With the suspension of the nuclear power project, the four seniors achieved success to a certain extent.

A Visual Frame of Contentious Performance: Chinese Internet Celebrity’s Practical Experience,Zhongxuan LIN,"protests, performance, celebrity, Ye Haiyan, visual","Contentious politics research is of vital importance to understand China during the period of rapid change. The research on contentious performance from a visual approach is an important research route emerging in recent years which attempts to provide a new explanation mechanism for more and more contentious performances in China. This research approach is mainly based on the traditional Western researches on contentious performance, and focuses on how protestors situated in China’s political opportunity structure perform protests with Chinese characteristics through visual means of images and media. This approach has contributed many valuable case studies, but there are still not any systematic, operational and analytical frameworks emerged from these case studies. Based on research methods of ethnographic participant observation and in-depth interviews, this article, therefore, uses Ye Haiyan, a Chinese internet celebrity, as a case study, and focuses on her contentious practices, to illustrate and interpret the practical logics and political implications of contentious performance from a visual perspective.

Negotiation between Popular Criticism and Journalists’ Contention in the Social Media Age: Analyses on Two Media Criticism Actions in Contemporary China,Yanhong LI,"social media, journalistic autonomy, accountability, media criticism","In the digital age, how will the rise of popular media criticism shape the journalism profession? This article puts this problem under the context of the theoretical debate between the normative theory of journalistic autonomy and that of accountability/responsibility, attempting to explore it through an empirical observation. Through a case study of two speech actions on media criticism occurring on the social media platform in mainland China in 2015, the study found that: contrary to the thesis of “positive accountability effect,” the popular media criticism does not necessarily become a positive force to shape the accountability of journalism, although to some extent they acted as media-monitoring citizenship practices. The public significance of these popular media criticism is limited in the two cases. The lack of media literacy and accountability culture in current Chinese society as well as the penetration of commercial power and the explicit and implicit control of the government on the internet all contributes to the limited effect. This article is a critique of the “positive accountability thesis,” however it does not deny the possible positive effect of popular media criticism, but further proposes a thesis that whether the media criticism enabled by the digital media can achieve its positive role in making journalism more accountable depends mainly on the media literacy of citizens on the one hand and the structural features of the public sphere in which it is embedded on the other hand.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=81&CA_ID=619,50,2019,Communication & Society

This paper attempts to investigate how the impact of using social media on the intercultural adaptation process among Chinese mainland students in Taiwan. In-depth interviews of 14 Chinese students in seven universities in Taiwan are conducted. The results show that the term “social media use” can be considered ambiguous and has multiple meanings in cyberspace in mainland China and Taiwan. Since Taiwan and mainland China have been at odds for seven decades, this research reveals that mainland Chinese students in Taiwan quickly noticed the schism and tended to manage their self-disclosure and identity with lots self-awareness.

"The Gaze, Glance and Spectacle of Nostalgia: Multiple Embodied Scopic Regimes in the Landscape Production of Nostalgic Tourism in China",Yan YUAN,"nostalgia, nostalgic tourism, visuality, scopic regimes, embodiment","This article investigates two villages to scrutinise the politics of visuality and the mechanisms employed in the development of “nostalgia tourism” in many Chinese villages since 2014. It goes beyond John Urry’s theory of “tourist gaze” and proposes the concept of “multiple embodied scopic regimes” as the framework to observe and to analyse, in order to depict a more systematic and dynamic picture of landscape production. It discovers that three different embodied scopic regimes are employed in the tourist development: “stop/gaze regime,” “flaneur/glance regime,” and “play/spectacle regime.” Each regime produces a unique fashion of visual pleasure and distinct mode of physical movements, manifested and afforded by different sets of cultural technologies, including the construction of village gates, viewing platforms, tourist trails, as well as the organisation of promotional events and the gamification of the attractions. The overall production of the tourist sites is featured by: (A) the intertwining of certain ways of seeing and moving within each regime, (B) the coexistence of three different regimes in the production of tourist landscape and experience. It is through these two mechanisms that the tourist sites could fulfil three layers of spatiality as a ritual space: arrival, passage, and liminality.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=81&CA_ID=616,50,2019,Communication & Society
Media Interaction in Social Networks: An Empirical Analysis of Sina Weibo,Yun WANG,"social network, news production, Weibo, social network analysis","The emergence of social media brought the sense of crisis about contradictions between new and old media. However, the co-opetition of different media typologies should be examined in an integrated relation network and identity field. This paper employs social network analysis to describe the relative positions of various media Weibo accounts, and explore media interaction relations as a whole. A 5-year time trend shows that the density of interactive network has declined slightly after the previous rise, and the network centralization gradually improved after a trough, which indicates central media’s increasing control. Traditional mainstream media maintain their core power in interactive structure while most new media platforms and self-media are marginalized. In addition, media in different forms do not interact in their own closed circle. The demassification trend unites professional media Weibo together and improves the cooperation of online news production. Based on the perspective of media interactive structure, researches may continue to discuss the content bias, news professionalism and transmedia convergence in online journalism and further respond to social media’s impact on information production.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=81&CA_ID=615,50,2019,Communication & Society

We focus in the current study on the distribution phase while covering some part of the production phase (e.g., coauthorship), based on publications in SSCICommunication journals from 1980 to 2019. Internationalization has become an increasingly popular topic in communication research but been largely conceived as a geopolitical or social class issue. We depart from the tradition by considering internationalized communication publications as a marketplace of ideas, in which nations compete for materialistic gains rather than ideological influence. To test the argument, we first examine whether the market is dominated by a single nation (i.e., monopolistic structure) or by a group of nations (oligopolistic structure) and further assess whether the market leaders collaborate (to form a cooperative oligopoly) or compete (a competitive oligopoly).",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=81&CA_ID=614,50,2019,Communication & Society

The findings show that patients tend to remain silence at the very beginning when they are diagnosed with cancer. Later on, patients decide who will be informed and what will be disclosed. By doing so, patients have their wills to manage privacy related to being a cancer patient. Family caregivers tend to avoid talking issues about “end-of-life” with patients.

A “Connectivity” View on the Localization: The Power Game in the Introduction of the TV Format,Yingjie DAI,"TV formats, introduction, power, global, local","From the power game perspective, and relying on field research methods combined with in-depth interview data, this paper analyzes the dynamic mechanism involved in the introduction of the TV format. The study found that the globe depends on local practice: the copyright party has to adopt global localization to realize the expansion of the market, while producers, platforms, advertisers, and other local forces make full use of globalization to maximize their own interests. Meanwhile, the place is not single or homogeneous, as there are internal conflicts. Furthermore, the introduction of the TV format is divided into three stages—preparation, study and determine, and negotiation—and covers political, economic, cultural, technical, and other forms of power. Political power is the most important consideration, allying with economic, cultural and technological power, and restricting the introduction of the pattern. The results of this study not only reflect the interaction between global and local entities, but also refute the school of cultural imperialism that follows the “lead–obey” binary mode.

Mosh with Patriarchy: The Listening and Identity of the Female Metalheads in Mainland China,Changzhi LIU,"heavy metal, metalhead, gender, identity, style","The gender structure in subculture has begun to receive more attention since the 1980s, while heavy metal music has always been a controversial genre because of its patriarchal ideology. In the context of the globalization of heavy metal, this study attempts to present the listening and identity issues of female metalheads in Mainland China by field research and interview. It argues that those female metalheads are mostly attracted by the emotions, rage, power, and beauty in heavy metal, and therefore find their identity and belonging. However, since they are facing the “dual marginalization” from both daily life and heavy metal scene, they are troubled by “sex and gender” problems all the time, this scene empowers but also limits them. Apart from rediscussing the classic issue of sexualized styles, this study identifies three main female styles in Mainland’s heavy metal scene: masculine style, sexy style, and the swagrebellious style. It reveals the interweaving of both cultural and social competition in the context of urban youth consumer culture and suggests a mixed-liquid identity.

"Design Efficiency in Negative Campaign Advertisements: Issue/Image Appeals, Unflattering Opponent Photographs or Caricatures, and Color Usage","Hsuan-Yi CHOU, Yen-Ting CHIANG","negative campaign advertisements, issue/image appeals, unflattering opponent photographs or caricatures, color usage, construal level theory","In elections in Taiwan and other democracies, the use of negative campaign advertising is on the rise. The strategic use of negative campaign advertising can have great influences on voters’ attitudinal responses towards the competing candidates. Therefore, further research into the impact of a candidate’s selective attacks on an opponent’s positions and image on voters’ attitudinal responses toward the attacker and the attacked opponent is important for both theorists and practitioners. Many negative campaign advertisements frequently use black and white (with very little or no color) in advertisement design and attempt to vilify the opponent using ludicrous, unflattering photographs or caricatures. However, few studies have examined the effects of these different advertisement design elements on voters’ attitudinal responses. Drawing on construal level theory, message match-up, and emotion studies, this study explores how the use of color in attack advertisements (advertisements that were primarily black-and-white versus those that were more colorful) separately moderated the relative effect on voters’ attitudinal responses between the following elements: targeting the opponent candidate’s positions versus image, and using unflattering opponent candidate’s photographs versus caricatures. Two experiments were conducted during the 2016 presidential election in Taiwan. Analytical results revealed that black-and-white advertisements that attacked the opponent’s image (versus his or her stance on an issue) and used unflattering opponent caricatures (versus photographs) were more effective in generating negative voter attitudes and voting intentions towards the opponent, and colorful advertisements that attacked issue stances (versus image) and used unflattering opponent photographs (versus caricatures) were also more effective in generating negative voter attitudes and voting intentions towards the opponent. The findings expand the research scope on negative campaign advertising, broaden the application of construal level theory to political communications, and provide recommendations on designing effective negative campaign advertisements with suitable message content and the effective use of color.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=82&CA_ID=621,51,2020,Communication & Society

It combines computer-assisted methods and a qualitative content analysis to explore the process of North-easterners being constructed in two news-source discourses, namely “in-group” (North-Eastern public accounts) and “others” (non-North-Eastern public accounts). This study employs the theory of “the other” to examine how prejudice by others is constructed on the basis of regional differences in a WeMedia context. This study found that North-Eastern culture shapes in-group discourse systems, personality traits, and everyday behaviors, thereby not only constructing the everyday discourse in North-Eastern WeMedia through regional dialect and culture, but also reinforcing the self-ridiculing stereotypes of others. Although North-Eastern culture continually evokes the in-group’s identity, it also strengthens and mobilizes others’ social memory based on the characteristics of the in-group. When seeking explanations for depression among North-Eastern individuals, others associate a self-denigrating stereotype with North-Easterners, presented in terms of negative occurrences that form a sharp contrast with traditionally positive figures from the past.

In this study, focusing on the problem of identity development, we speculate how matchmaking Apps, the latest development of social media that also stand at the intersection of how we arrange space and link people, may affect gay individuals. On one hand, gay culture constructs its own subculture cyber-base, producing Queer as Folk as its standard discourse. On the other hand, at the intersection of communication technology, social intercourse, and homosexual love, a series of dualities mutually strengthen, probably exacerbating the double personality problem, which is already a typical predicament of gay individuals under strong social pressure and usually blocks the process of identity development toward personality integration, the final stage of gay identity development.

A swift transition from coal to clean energy policy is important to govern the smog problem. In the process of this policy implementation, multiple social groups participated in the discussion and multi-perspective opinions were expressed, finally resulting in important policy adjustment. This study selected four media outlets: People’s Daily, The Paper, China Environment News, and Sina Microblog, in order to analyze the media agenda from 2015 to 2017. Lag-cross correlation analysis was used to test the media agenda interaction during the period of policy adjustment at the end of 2017. The findings indicate that a significant interaction could be observed in these four media outlets, and that in the different stages of the policy process, different inter-media agenda effects could be measured. When environmental policies raise social problems and then become framed as news events, in the process, urban elite media can integrate their agendas and promote their diffusion to bridge public discourse and the official media agenda.

A Virtual Ethnography Study of Vulnerable Rights Activism in the Middle Class,Di XU,"Middle-class rights protection, action practice, group identity, “WUNC”, “soft” protest","This paper, taking the Internet financial rights protection case as an example, adopts the virtual ethnographic research method to examine the middle-class group conducting group rights-defending actions in the online discussion forum. It uses class consciousness and the expanded “WUNC” model as the benchmark. By studying the actors, strategies, and the characteristics of the action, this paper explores the identity and resistance logic of the group. The study concludes that in the process of safeguarding property rights, middle-class groups show a non-violent “soft” protest pattern. The middle-class action groups for rights protection undertake a legal and rational struggle to compete with the government’s power along the maximum boundary permitted by law. In rights-defending actions based on the pursuit of interests, middle-class groups present a strange phenomenon of identity loss and disappearing confrontation in the cognition of action subjects and the selection of action strategies. The action characteristics of its “soft” form of protest highlight the dilemma of resource fragmentation.

Revisiting the Situational Crisis Communication Theory,"W. Timothy COOMBS, Yi-Hui Christine HUANG",,"W. Timothy Coombs is an outstanding communication scholar with a particular focus on crisis communication. His work was instrumental in developing Situational Crisis Communication Theory (SCCT), which is one of the most widely accepted theories in the field of crisis communication. In this interview, Professor Coombs first shares how he applied attribution theory and the concept of perceived responsibility in crisis communication studies. He then argues that the social media era calls for a variety of media forms and content. He stresses the importance of ethical base response for crisis communication in different cultural contexts. He also explicates the research on paracrisis and stresses the importance of cross-disciplinary crisis communication research with other fields (e.g. management theory, behavioral economics, health communication, risk communication). Finally, Professor Coombs points out that there is still much for researchers to contribute to crisis communication studies. He encourages further exploration of crisis response strategy’s operationalization. According to Coombs, researchers should not focus merely on theory but should keep track of the crisis communications profession as well.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=84&CA_ID=639,53,2020,Communication & Society
Adding Flavor to Love: Decoding Domestic Femininities Constructed in Cooking-Related TV Ads,Ping SHAW,"cooking, food, TV advertisements, domestic femininities, discourse analysis","This paper utilizes discourse analysis to examine what kind of domestic discourses are embedded in the content of the cooking-related TV advertisements broadcasted in the postfeminist media culture from the year of 2000 to the present and what kind of strategies the advertisers employ to persuade female consumers. The study finds that the meanings of doing cooking, doing gender and family are interrelated. The dominant domestic discourse is still quite conservative, not only maintaining the boundary between the public sphere and the private sphere and a gender-based division of labor but also emphasizing the emotional character of middle-class families.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=84&CA_ID=638,53,2020,Communication & Society

Public Relations Ethics in the Age of Social Media: Identifying the Ethical Values and Challenges,I-Huei CHENG,"PR ethics, social media, new media","Social media provides newer opportunities for public relations practitioners to communicate and interact with the public. Some uses of social media, however, such as fake blogs, paid blog posts, and fake posts on online forums, are controversial and have received public attention. The ambiguity in the ethical issues involving the use of social media as a public relations tool suggests a need for further investigation for both academia and industry. Given the limited literature on public relations ethics focused on social media, the current study is aimed at exploring the ethical challenges imposed by new media through in-depth interviews with senior public relations managers in Taiwan. It was found that new media has become an important part of public relations practices today and that its high interactivity and rapid speed of information flow bring about a stronger demand for content production and more tasks of ethical considerations, such as information accuracy and disclosure, anonymity, and privacy on the internet. Findings also suggest that public relations managers can play an influential role by making ethical decisions while considering both the core values and a set of situational factors.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=84&CA_ID=636,53,2020,Communication & Society

Based on data from a survey, results indicate that rural residents with a stronger sense of social presence have a higher network of interpersonal communication quality (network of interpersonal participation and perceived communication efficiency) and a network of interpersonal contact intensity (interaction intensity with acquaintances and strangers). In addition, the influence of such quality and intensity plays a positive role via the mediating effect of emotional response. It suggests that perception factors significantly affect users’ interaction behaviors.

A Study of the Privacy Behavior of Taiwan Facebook Users after the Cambridge Analytica Scandal,"Yi-Ning Katherine CHEN, Chia-Ho Ryan WEN","Cambridge Analytica, communication privacy management, Facebook, privacy concerns, privacy strategies","The Facebook–Cambridge Analytica scandal in early 2018 exposed the previously little noticed loopholes in Facebook’s privacy policy and management, discomposing users worldwide. Taking this scandal as a departure point, our research adopts communication privacy management theory (CPM), aiming to delineate the privacy concerns of Taiwanese users on Facebook and their strategies to protect themselves against potential privacy infringements. The findings of our survey of 503 participants recruited via the Election Study Center, National Chengchi University, demonstrated that, first, among all the independent variables (user motives, habitual usage, network size, daily usage time, age, education, marital status, gender, political tendencies, and monthly family income), only daily usage time was negatively associated with privacy concern, while the others were insignificant. Second, our factor analysis revealed that Taiwanese users commonly employed four strategies of privacy protection: deletion of old content, cessation of personal information updates (including mobile device data synchronizations), content visibility restrictions, and unfollowing. Furthermore, no privacy paradox was witnessed because users’ privacy concerns encouraged all four strategies. Finally, some demographic variables effectively predicted the strategies. Sex (males) was inversely related to the cessation of personal information updates, content visibility restrictions, and unfollowing. Contrary to our expectations, support for Taiwan’s mainstream parties (e.g., Kuomintang, the primary opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party, and the New Power Party, a rising political party) was extraneous, yet support for peripheral and relatively radical parties (e.g., the Taiwan Solidarity Union, the Chinese New Party) had a direct bearing on users’ cessation of personal information updates on Facebook.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=85&CA_ID=646,54,2020,Communication & Society
The Mediating Effect of Privacy Worry: An Empirical Analysis of Structural Equation Models Based on the Use of WeChat by College Students,"Jinghong XU, Weipeng HOU","self-efficacy, trust, risk perception, privacy worry, privacy protection","By investigating the use of WeChat at six universities in China, this study aims to explore influencing factors and the relations between them on WeChat users’ privacy worries, reveal the status quo and the restrictive factors in WeChat users’ privacy protection, and examine the mediating effect of privacy worry on privacy protection. Based on empirical data, this study constructed a structural equation model of self-efficacy, risk perception trust, privacy worry, and privacy protection. The study found that college students’ trust in WeChat privacy was negatively correlated with risk perception and positively correlated with self-efficacy, risk perception and self-efficacy were negatively correlated. The risk perception and trust level of college students’ WeChat privacy positively affected their privacy worry, while risk perception, self-efficacy, and trust level positively affected their privacy protection level. In addition, the study also found that privacy worry had a mediating effect on privacy protection when risk perception was used as an independent variable.

With information tools, this research collected relevant posts from 50 fan pages on Facebook in Taiwan for five consecutive days following the occurrence of three targeted events. By examining the link address of the API, the researcher was able to retrieve the original posts to compare the percentage of overlap between the original posts and the curators’ reposts by applying the Chinese word tagger. The author found a 60%–80% overlap between curators’ reposts and the original news reports, and the news format was not a factor in the overlap rate. However, after further analyzing the details of the word tagging between the original news and the reposts, the researcher discovered that the curators tended to use more emotional wording as well as non-official news sources. When referring to news sources, curators tended to point to a person instead of a governmental official’s title.

In the era of social media, once marginalized subaltern groups can enter the public space and participate in shaping it through their own expression. They tend to express themselves through literature, poetry, and cultural products, different from the rational discourse conceived by Habermas. Based on the theoretical framework of the “cultural public sphere” and the case studies of “Xu Lizhi” and “Fan Yusu,” this study discusses how the expression of subaltern groups constructs the cultural public sphere. I argue that “the cultural public sphere” has shaped the self-understanding of subaltern groups and the public’s understanding of these groups. The mechanisms of empathizing and reframing play an essential role in the formation of the cultural public sphere, at the same time, they may become a repulsive force that serves to prevent subaltern discourse from entering the public sphere. The cultural public sphere related to subaltern groups is fragmented, which is rooted in the fragmentation of the social structure.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=85&CA_ID=641,54,2020,Communication & Society

Moreover, the effects of Internet use on political trust have become increasingly related to public support for the legitimacy of the regime. Based on an analysis of data collected from the 2010 China General Social Survey (CGSS), this study attempts to rule out a potential endogeneity bias by employing the techniques of propensity score matching and instrumental variable regression to estimate the effects of Internet use on political trust. The results showed that compared with institutional and cultural factors, the use of Internet has had sufficient explanatory power in shaping individuals’ political trust. Moreover, the results showed that the use of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression underestimated the effects of the Internet.

Constructing the Image of the Great Man in Biographical Films: Representations of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen in Taiwan and Mainland China in the 1980s,Yen-Yuan NI,"Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, biographical films, narrative","This study compares images of the hero or great man in parallel “crossstrait” biographical films about Dr. Sun Yat-Sen produced in 1986. The construction of the image of Dr. Sun has long been a main element in the official discourses of Taiwan and Mainland China. The KMT of Taiwan conferred the title “Father of the Nation” on Dr. Sun, and the Communist Party honored him as a great revolutionary forerunner. Regardless of his historical position and role in the official discourse, Dr. Sun is considered a source of political legitimacy. However, due to changes in cross-strait relations and ideology, the image of Dr. Sun has been transformed in films produced on each side of the Strait. The 1987 debut of a cross-strait film coincided with the 120th anniversary of Dr. Sun’s birth. This biographical film about Dr. Sun’s life was filmed in 1986 when the relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait were still hostile. The official ideologies of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party colored the portrayals of Dr. Sun. Our textual interpretations of these two films demonstrate that the official discourses of the time determined the representations of Dr. Sun, as well as the narrative strategies and expositions used to construct his image and biography. The official ideologies and historical perspectives on either side of the Taiwan Strait affected the images of Dr. Sun in the film.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=86&CA_ID=650,55,2021,Communication & Society

According to the gateway belief model, messages about scientific consensus positively affect the public’s perception of scientific consensus, which then improves their understanding of and support for related public policy. Because of the negative interpretations of expressions posted on the Chinese Internet, this study explores the moderating role of an individual’s psychological reactance in the cognitive impact of scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified (GM) food. An experimental study revealed that consensus messages effectively enhanced consensus perceptions and thus affected scientific beliefs about GM food safety. However, this effect was moderated by individual psychological reactance. Compared with high-psychological reactance groups, consensus messages can affect and effectively improve the scientific beliefs of low-psychological reactance groups. Enhancing the details and vividness of consensus messages and strengthening the credibility and persuasion of consensus messages could dispel or reduce the moderating effects of psychological reactance. Applying persuasive communication to the scientific communication field could help narrow the gap between scientists and the public regarding scientific issues by communicating vivid and credible messages about scientific consensus.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=87&CA_ID=660,56,2021,Communication & Society

In addition, this study investigated how social media, with its networked nature, could mitigate the negative effects of cyberbullying with respect to self-esteem and perceived well-being. By analyzing data collected in the 2017 Taiwan Communication Survey, this study found that the use of instant messaging sites, not SNSs, increased the likelihood of being a victim of cyberbullying. In addition, being cyberbullied was negatively associated with self-esteem and well-being. Self-esteem was found to mediate the relationship between cyberbully victimization and well-being.

Faded Technical Myth—Digital Capital and Female Online Labour in Shadow Education,Jing CHEN,"shadow education, technical myth, online labour, digital capital","The following two research topics were discussed through in-depth interviews and online field investigation of female online teachers in shadow education. First, the work analyzed the group composition, technique use, and labour manners of online teachers. Then, we explored the technical myths of contemporary Chinese online education, as well as the complicated relationship among digital capital, technology platforms, and online labour. The research found that Internet platforms used the long-standing Internet myth of “Internet + shadow education = social justice” to smooth out the imbalance of educational resources. Through taking the social responsibility of realizing class mobility as a slogan, the existing myths of business and culture were used to construct a mixed technical myth. Thus the labour force was absorbed to cater to digital capital and the company obtained policy protection. The technology platform concealed the identities and geographic locations of workers through crossregional labour mobilization. Cheap online labour was packed into high-valueadded one-to-one services to earn profits from labour differences. In the labour process, “dematerialization” and “labour subcontracting” were realized, and labour control was implemented through “digital circular monitoring”. Online workers’ “class-hour conversion,” “spatial degree,” “emotional labour,” and “fuzzy work boundaries” had all become new labour contributions. During the labour process, female online teachers’ original technical myths about the platform faded quickly. This was due to the online labour experience and individual re-judgment of the nature and labour value of the platform, instead of the popularization and use of technology.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=87&CA_ID=658,56,2021,Communication & Society

For example, in 2013, the manager of a cake shop in the US was accused of discrimination because he refused to make wedding cakes for a same-sex couple based on his religious beliefs. Although such events seem to be negligible, they are significant in the struggle for gender equality and human rights. Advocates of gender equality and human rights did not fight for the content or price of the cake but whether the manager had the right to refuse to serve particular customers in the cake shop. This study focused on an event that occurred in October 2016 when the woman’s clothing store Vieso refused the request of male customers to try on wide-leg pants. The researcher tried to understand the audience’s opinions about this event and the ideology that underlay them. To obtain the study samples, we extracted the audience’s comments on this event from Apple Daily and PTT. After duplicate and unrelated comments were deleted, 645 valid comments were obtained, and the researcher conducted content and discourse analyses on them. The results revealed that the audience made two main comments on this event. One was “customers should be treated uniformly, no matter of gender, or it is discrimination.” The other was “stores have the right to decide their own management policies.” A further analysis revealed three main ideologies in the media field: discourse on equal rights, discourse on management discourse, and discourse on differences between males and females.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=87&CA_ID=657,56,2021,Communication & Society

Drawing on the case of T-mall’s error in sales quantity, this study explored the categories, communication effects, and applicable situations of self-mockery. The findings showed that self-mockery, which denotes the admission of mistakes by self-depreciation, is an expression of positive emotion and delivers an emotion-laden message that is congruent with a verbal one in terms of the organization’s intention to take responsibility. Because self-mockery was found to have a distracting effect, this study classified it as a new category in paracrisis response strategies: reframe. The study also found that the self-mocking strategy was appropriate for online audiences when an organization’s mistakes are unintentional, irrelevant for expertise, and victimless.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=87&CA_ID=656,56,2021,Communication & Society
For a Comparative Communication Perspective: Reflections on the Localization and Innovation of Media Studies in Chinese Societies,Joseph M. CHAN,"conceptual innovation, theoretical innovation, comparative communication research, comparative research methods, localization of communication studies, Chinese communication studies","This article seeks to explicate the comparative communication perspective with special reference to conceptual and theoretical innovations. While its epistemological strengths are highlighted, the article also examines what appears to be a “comparative turn” in communication studies. It illustrates the desirability and feasibility of comparative communication studies by drawing on various research projects done in Chinese societies. Communication studies have been criticized for its relative lack of concepts and theories. The best answer to this criticism is to innovate in conceptualization and theorization by adopting the comparative communication perspective. Comparison, a key component of conceptual and theoretical innovation, is applicable to every aspect of the research process, including conceptualization, research question formulation, hypothesizing, theorization, and the articulation of research significance. The perspective assumes that all communication phenomena are results of social contingencies. Comparisons can be formal and explicit. They can also be informal and implicit, meaning that the researchers can think comparatively, engaging in thought experiments, asking how the phenomenon in question may vary as the social context changes over time or space. The comparative perspective requires the contingencies giving rise to a communication phenomenon to be problematized and spelt out. It enables us to have a better understanding of the generalities and specifications of media theories and to have better knowledge of how variables at the systemic level can impinge upon communication behavior at other levels.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=87&CA_ID=655,56,2021,Communication & Society
Thirty Years of Media Effects Research,"Ran WEI, Hai LIANG",,"Professor Ran Wei is an influential and productive scholar in the fields of media effects, communication technology and society, and mobile communication. In this dialogue, he was invited to share his research experience on media effects and information communication technology in the past 30 years. Professor Wei characterized himself as a “transitional scholar” who bridges conventional and new media studies. He started with sharing how his journey in the field of media effects expanded to new media studies, including mobile communication and virtual reality. In response to the criticisms of media effects research in the digital era, he suggested that social scientific researches should go beyond personal and interpersonal levels to adopt the institutional approach to investigate the media effects under different social contexts and cultures. Professor Wei also emphasized the value and pitfalls of the emerging computational methods in current media effects studies. In particular, he introduced how to combine traditional and big data methods in his ongoing collaborative project on Covid-19 mis/disinformation.

“Do We Still Need to Talk About Gender Equality?” Hong Kong Journalists on Gender Awareness,Luwei Rose LÜQIU,"journalists, feminism, phenomenology, journalism, gender equality","In the profession of journalism, gender is paradoxically both presented and denied. On one hand, journalists have been indoctrinated with the view that journalism is a de-gendered profession, and on the other hand, they face the effects of gender throughout their career development. Based on the case study of Hong Kong, a survey and in-depth interviews are conducted among frontline journalists who covered the 2019 protests in Hong Kong to explore differences between gender perspectives and daily reporting in journalists based on phenomenological methods and feminist perspectives. The findings suggest that in the process of phenomenological typification and attitudes toward the gendered system, journalists simultaneously embody and deny gender. The denial of gender leads to lower gender awareness among journalists, thus ignoring the structural gender inequality that exists in newsrooms.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=88&CA_ID=670,57,2021,Communication & Society
Distinguishing Insiders and Outsiders: Alternative Representations of LGBT in the China Daily (1991–2019),Lin JIAO,"China Daily, LGBT, homonationalism, queer modernity, politics of representation","This paper explores the history of the representations of LGBT in the Chinese national English-language newspaper the China Daily, from 1991 to 2019. It divides the representations into four phases: the initial phase (1991–2003), the rapid growth phase (2004–2008), the peak phase (2009–2014) and the silent phase (2015–2019). The findings show that official Chinese media do not constitute a homogeneous entity, in contrast, they produce highly heterogeneous content while targeting domestic and international audiences. As one of the most important media in China that is responsible for international communication, China Daily, has to balance its readers’ interests and its goal of “telling China’s story.” Compared with the People’s Daily (Chinese edition), the China Daily’s representation of the LGBT group is unconventional in its construction of a country that values freedom, openness, and tolerance. This representation has been made possible by changes in domestic and international contexts, LGBT activism in China, and journalist agency, which are justified in de-othering narratives that follow the logic of homonationalism.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=88&CA_ID=669,57,2021,Communication & Society

This study conducted four focus group interviews with 31 participants who interpreted three TV commercials offered by the researcher. Most participants were active in developing their own interpretations of the ads. Their interpretations were socially based on their sports practices and the media critique vocabulary of feminism, which formed their cultural tools and discourse repertoire.

"Mom Loves You: Chinese Mother-Fans, Idol Industry, Gender, and Intimatopia",Meijiadai BAI,"mother-fans, idol, celebrity fan, intimacy, intimatopia","Mother-fans fantasize their idols as if they were their children. With importation of Japanese style idol production line, introduction of Korean Produce 101 formula, and relocation of fandom to Weibo platform, Chinese fans created this new collective identity, based on existing fan identities and subcultures. Outsiders of fan community tend to simplify this identity and stigmatize mother-fans' activities. By conducting in-depth interviews, this study treats fans as subjects with celebrity-adoring experiences and mediated fandom history, and seeks to understand the reasons why fans create this identity, and what it means to them. This paper finds that the mother-fan emerged because of the industry. Fans creatively transform this identity to legitimize their rights to critique the industry, thus protect their critical thinking and position as subjects. Under this umbrella identity, mother-fans passionately and rationally develop their consciousness and thrive in their collective intimatopia of reality and fantasy.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=88&CA_ID=667,57,2021,Communication & Society
"Patriarchy, Networked Misogyny, and Interpreting Feminism in China",Lihua GAN,"Tianyuan feminism, Zhihu, networked misogyny, Chinese patriarchy","Information and communication technology have both contributed to the spread of feminism in China and stimulated hate speech and misogyny. Based on qualitative analyses of the texts of all relevant questions and answers on the Chinese Q&A platform Zhihu, the findings of this study showed a binary interpretation and presentation of Chinese feminism and feminists in maledominated online discussions, namely authentic feminism versus fake feminism. Authentic feminism is thought to focus on individual efforts, equality, and both men’s and women’s rights. As a type of fake feminism, Tianyuan feminism is thought to ask for rights without fulfilling gender responsibilities, as well as over-emphasizing material interests and pursuing women’s privileges. Tianyuan feminists are pictured as unfeminine and subservient to foreigners, especially foreign males. Betrothal gifts, childbirth and care, and surnaming the next generation were the most frequent topics among the relevant questions and answers on Zhihu. There is a huge gap between people’s, especially males’ evaluations of gender equality and the real situation in China. The opposite gender is judged negatively, and Chinese patriarchy is confronted by both deconstruction and reconstruction. Further economic, social, and cultural reforms are necessary to provide both institutional support and make structural changes to promote gender equality.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=88&CA_ID=666,57,2021,Communication & Society
Performative Connectivity and Digital Feminist Action: A Study on the MeToo Movement in China,"Yueqin HUANG, Yao HUANG","digital performative connectivity, MeToo movement, feminism, anti-sexual harassment, problematization","The rise of the MeToo movement in China in 2018 was the result of the spread of the global MeToo movement to mainland China, which inspired a new round of gender struggles against the backdrop of the rise of digital communication technologies and the transformation of collective action. Based on the empirical practice of the Chinese MeToo movement and gender performativity theory, this study focuses on exploring the connections among emotions, meaning, and relationships in women’s MeToo narratives to correct the bias of “connective action” in neglecting human interaction and dynamism. The author develops a new concept of performative connectivity, which includes two dimensions: the dynamic connection of linguistic inter-subjectivity and the technical connection of digital communication. The dynamic connection is the intrinsic motivation for digital feminist action, while digital communication technology is seen as the cultural technology used to organize and expand feminist discourse and practices. The two are overlapping and closely intertwined, thus forming the associated configuration of “digital performative connectivity.”",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=88&CA_ID=665,57,2021,Communication & Society
Whose Love Is AI For? The Networked Body and Multiple Masculinities in Chinese Child-Rearing Robots,"Yan YUAN, Lin ZHU","robot, AI, feminist STS, masculinities, gender studies","What would happen to gender politics if AI technology, which is dominated by male scientists and engineers, entered domestic child rearing, a social domain that is conventionally dominated by women? The rise of childrearing robots in China since 2016 has provided us with a focus for addressing this question. In this study, five brands of robots are used as examples to examine gender bias and gender strategies in this newly emerged technological artifact, following the paradigm of feminist STS and the theoretical approach of masculinity studies. The data were drawn from two sources: media representations of the robots and the functions that they embody. In examining the artifact as a networked body, the findings show that the technology is composed of front, middle, and back platforms, and it performs three different roles, respectively: partner, parent, and expert. In accordance with these roles, the robots demonstrated three masculinities: naughty boy, heroic patriarch, and rational man. Despite their differences, they all showed the male bias of the technology compared with the previously female dominance in its application context. On one hand, the multiplicity of masculinity in the robots breaks the stereotypes about men but, on the other hand, reinforces the gender division of labour in domestic child rearing and the superiority of men. As a technological solution driven by dominant masculinity and fatherhood, it may help to produce a space for rebuilding the relationship between fathers and children, but by defending the authority of fathers and platforms, it also risks the possibility of devaluing mothers’ experiences and interests in domestic child rearing.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=88&CA_ID=664,57,2021,Communication & Society

Based on the uses and gratifications theory, this research aims to investigate the moderators of the effects of adolescents’ motivations for using mobile dating apps on their social risks. In this study, an online survey was disseminated through popular websites among adolescents in April and May 2018. The participants included 512 adolescents aged 15 to 17 years. Among them, 473 had used mobile dating apps at least once in the previous year, and their responses to the questionnaire provided the data used in the analysis. The survey results showed that most of the adolescents in this study did not use mobile dating apps frequently. Killing time, curiosity, and making new friends were the strongest motivations. Among various types of social risks, the adolescents most often disclosed their personal information. Both physical and social needs directly enhanced social risks. However, only physical motivation indirectly influenced social risks through the usage of mobile dating apps. Instructive parental mediation can only decrease the usage of mobile dating apps caused by entertainment motivation.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=89&CA_ID=677,58,2021,Communication & Society
The Fading of an Electronic Monument: Visual Productions of Mao Zedong’s Funeral and Shifting Memory Regimes in Contemporary China,Hongtao LI,"Mao Zedong’s funeral, media events, visual reproduction, visual memory, memory regime","Media events are a “live broadcasting of history,” but not all media events etch themselves into the collective memory and become “electronic monuments.”Mao Zedong died on 9 September 1976. Nine days later, a grand state memorial involving one million people was held in Tiananmen Square, which was broadcast live across the country. This national mourning ceremony, however, gradually faded in the following decades. By conceptualizing the life cycle of the media event as collective remembering, this paper analyzes the (re)production and circulation of images associated with Mao Zedong’s death to explore shifting memory regimes in contemporary China and their effects on the making and fading of an electronic monument. We contend that the memory regime in the 1970s centered on the allegiance to a supreme leader, which shaped the performance of the media event and led to the suppressive erasure of the images of the Gang of Four after they were removed from power. In the reform era, a new dominant memory regime was formed based on the historical achievements of the Communist Party of China and its current concern regarding legitimacy. In the process of rewriting the historical script of the recent past, Hua Guofeng vanished, and the iconic images of “taking oath” and the underlying script of “continuous revolution” also collapsed. Since then, the unprecedented state ceremony has been reconfigured as a historical turning point in recent Chinese history, and a decisive event in the past has also been rewritten as having occurred in a “foreign country.”",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=89&CA_ID=676,58,2021,Communication & Society
Exploring the Media Myth of Cultural and Creative Industries—Using Van Gorp’s Approach to Framing Analysis,Huei-Ling LIU,"cultural and creative industry, framing analysis, frame package, ideology, culture and public sphere","Based on the media’s role in the cultural public sphere, this study explores the hidden social and cultural phenomena of media framing using Van Gorp’s approach to framing analysis to examine news about cultural and creative industries. The results of the analysis of 3,445 news items publicized between 2010 and 2016 showed that through various media framing processes, economic value, as the social mainstream, was embedded in news content, which served to construct cultural and creative industries. This economic value led to the revitalization of culture in Taiwan and provided an effective solution to the bottlenecks encountered in other industries. In the fluctuating emphases on cultural and economic values in news content, the latter were usually privileged. The counter frame of critical reflection existed, but its impact was limited. The findings also suggested that a myth of cultural and creative industries was constructed through the repetition of news disclosures and interactions between the media and social culture, thus preparing the ground for its popularity. The results indicate a lack of pluralistic and rational communication, although media discourses seemed to have strengthened the mainstream ideology. Thus, the role of media as a public mediator in the cultural public sphere has not been satisfactory.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=89&CA_ID=675,58,2021,Communication & Society

It is assumed by many that those who still like watching television are elders, women, and the underclass. The study aims to enable the voices of these marginalized viewers to be heard and, through their eyes, the values of one-way communication of traditional mass media are highlighted. Based on the analysis of data gathered in participatory observations and in-depth interviews, the results did not show significant age, gender, and educational differences in the participants’ involvement in parasocial interaction. The viewers in this study interacted with television based on the appeal of the media content as well as their personal technological devices. Even in interacting with old media, the viewers could make sense of closed texts and complete them with their own interpretive repertoire and affective involvement. Thus, the one-way communication of the old media was perceived as two-way personal interactions.

COVID-19) pandemic has hit America hard. This study examines the perceptual and behavioral effects of up-to-date news about confirmed COVID 19 cases and deaths. Using data collected from an online survey of 1,094 Americans, the role of media use pattern and cultural orientations in shaping Americans’ perception of the pandemic and behavioral responses was explored. Results show that respondents generally believed other Americans were more impacted by the latest news on infections and mortalities. However, the more they paid attention to the news, and the more they were oriented toward collectivist values, the less biased were their perceptions of the impact of such news. Finally, collectivist value orientation and perceived effects of the news on the self are significant predictors of adopting preventive measures, such as masking up and keeping social distance. Taken together, the results show that collectivist value orientation is a key micro-psychometric level predictor of risk perceptions and adoption of preventive actions. This study contributes to the third-person effects theory by offering a cultural explanation of biased perception concerning the impact of pandemic news and behavioral consequences of that biased perception.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=89&CA_ID=672,58,2021,Communication & Society

We examine Spearman’s correlation between the agendas of candidates, media, and the public during the 2020 Taiwan presidential election and also focus on the issue development strategies of the DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen and the Kuomintang candidate Han Guo-yu. This study takes all the data collected by OpView, which was developed by eLand Company for analysis, and selects all public texts from ten topics that were intensely debated by both sides. The study finds that, during any time of the campaign period, the candidates’ agendas are highly related to the voters’ but not necessarily to the media’s. At the beginning of the election cycle, the incumbent advantage allowed Tsai Ing-wen to choose a divergent strategy, however, in the later stage, her agenda merged with Han Guo-yu’s. Highly political issues related to Taiwan’s sovereignty then became the key axis of the election campaign, the media and candidates both concentrated on Hong Kong’s anti-extradition law movement, fake news, and Taiwan’s anti-infiltration bill—topics that far surpassed pension reform, labor reform, and marriage equality. However, Tsai had the advantage of being the incumbent and adopted the strategy of ignoring Han.

Trends Creators and Discoverers in Online Political Discussion: A Study Based on the Golden and LIHKG Forums in Hong Kong,"Zhi-Jin ZHONG, Jin-Lian ZHOU","social roles, public discussion, LIHKG forum, Golden forum","Based on the theory of social roles, this paper claims that users in online forums can be divided into various categories according to the characteristics of their posting behaviors and the interaction network structures of their replies. Utilizing online discussions in the LIHKG and Golden forum during the 2019 Anti-extradition Bill movement in Hong Kong, this study uses the volumes of popular posts that users have created and discovered as indicators to group users into categories. Specifically, users within the two online forums are divided into four categories: (1) the popular topics/trends creators, (2) the popular topics/trends discoverers, (3) the super users (who are both popular topics creators and discoverers), and (4) other common users. Creators, discoverers, and super users are all found to play the role of current leader in online political discussion. Although their proportion was low (1% in Golden, 0.1% in LIHKG), they have contributed high percentages of popular topics in the forums (12.67% in Golden, 31.84% in LIHKG), this finding suggests that the influence of internet users is uneven. Compared with common users, current leaders posted and replied to topics more frequently, and the trends discoverers stirred up heated topics by repeated participation in discussion. Current leaders are also located in the central position of the forum interaction network, with higher connectivity, centrality, and reciprocity. Moreover, the interaction among current leaders presents a “Richmen’s Club” phenomenon (which is more obvious in the Golden forum), meaning that current leaders are more likely to interact with each other rather than communicating with common users. By comparing the different interaction networks of the two forums, this study finds that there is a clustering pattern in the Golden forum, while the LIHKG forum shows decentralized features. The comparison between Golden and LIHKG forums also shows that the Golden forum has evolved into a territory for a minority of users, who can lead the trends of online public discussion through creating and discovering popular topics. In contrast, the LIHKG forum presents as a wild environment where users are more active, the topics are more focused, and the discursive opportunities among users are more dispersed.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=90&CA_ID=691,59,2022,Communication & Society
"Issue Shifting and Attribute Salience: A Study on Agenda Setting among Social Bots, the Public, and the Media","Bei ZHAO, Hongzhong ZHANG","social bots, agenda setting, social media, time-lag, public opinion","In recent years, social bots have participated widely in social media conversations and have become an emerging force in influencing public opinion. By expanding the scale of information and creating the prevalence of false information, have social bots interfered with the trend of the social network agenda? Taking the China-US trade dispute as an example, this study uses the perspective of agenda-setting theory to explore the interactions between social bots, the public, and the media within social networks. First, the study finds that in first-level agenda setting, the social bots’ agenda has a positive impact on the public agenda. However, in second-level agenda setting, the relationship between the social bots and the public is not characterized by a one-way influence, rather, it reveals a complex and dynamic interaction. Specifically, there are three main interactive mechanisms: (1) the social bots’ agenda affects the public agenda, (2) the public agenda affects the social bots’ agenda, (3) the social bots’ agenda and the public agenda influence each other. The media reveals a strong agenda-setting ability in first-level agenda setting, which has an impact on both social bots and the public, however, it shows that the effect of media agenda setting in the second level of substantive attributes is weaker than the effect of social bots and the public. In the negative affective attribute, the media is also affected by social bots. Finally, compared with previous studies, the time lag of social bots in second-level agenda setting is significantly shortened in our study.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=90&CA_ID=690,59,2022,Communication & Society

From an externalist perspective, this study draws on field theory and Google patent data to systematically examine the status, actors, content, and external factors of news technology innovation in mainland China (2010–2019). The results show that the field of news technology innovation has been expanding, and Eastern China enjoys the largest share. News technology innovation involves multiple and diverse actors, with the information technology industry playing a dominant role and government institutions participating as new entrants. Results from topic modeling reveal six sub-fields of news technology innovation: (1) content management systems, (2) outdoor media, (3) computational journalism, (4) news broadcasting, (5) news recommendation systems, and (6) reporting equipment. Regression analyses based on structural topic modeling show that the distribution of the six sub-fields has evolved constantly during the past ten years. Moreover, the study finds that these industrial clusters have unique advantages in certain sub-fields, and there are more news innovations on emerging technologies (e.g., computational journalism and news recommendation systems) in Eastern China than the other regions, which reflects the distinct capital and habitus for innovation held by these industry clusters and regions.

Research on Microblog User Clustering from a Cognitive Perspective,Sheng ZHOU,"microblog user, two-mode network, clustering","Focusing on microblog user attributes and missing content data, a microblog users clustering method based on users’ cognitive differences is proposed. By referencing users’ selections and judgments regarding the information sources they follow and forward, we can identify the typical characteristics of group members, we can also use this information to analyze users’ behaviors and attitudes while they are participating in various kinds of groups. On the basis of users’ perceived dissimilarity regarding microblog topics, a two-mode network comprised of user and media is built. The clustering of users is then realized by cutting the bipartite graph in the network. By applying the spectral clustering method to the hybrid mechanism of two clustering stages (i.e., followed topics and forwarded topics), we can effectively distinguish between user groups with different cognitive attributes, this also enables us to accurately observe the transmission mechanism of information within the community. Taking the Tang Lanlan event as an example, this paper introduces specific operation and evaluation criteria of the microblog user clustering method. Upon thorough consideration of the scale and accuracy of the group division, the results show that the comprehensive property is improved with use of the proposed clustering method. The actual results demonstrate the precision and effectiveness of the proposed method for the purposes of group division, behavior prediction, and public opinion analysis of social platform users.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=90&CA_ID=687,59,2022,Communication & Society

This essay points out that the main challenge of communication research in Hong Kong is the articulation between the macro and micro level analyses, and this is also the place where Hong Kong studies are most likely to contribute to communication research at large.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=90&CA_ID=686,59,2022,Communication & Society
Navigating the SSCI Publication Maze,"Shuhua ZHOU, Louisa HA, Bu ZHONG, Fuyuan SHEN",,"SSCI publishing is vital to the success of a faculty member, as manifested by the saying “publish or perish.” It is also often the standard by which scientific advancement is measured and such productivity partly establishes a university’s reputation. The process of journal publication is complex, and the ability to navigate this maze is an essential skill in higher education and research. This panel gathers four seasoned editors to guide you through this process.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=700,60,2022,Communication & Society
Fluid Social Construction of Justice: Transition of Trial-Based Media Events (2000–2016),"Chun YANG, Fen LIN","media trial, media supervision, social construction of justice, media events, media-court relationship","This study focuses on media events reported in the extensive news coverage of judicial trials in China. From a social constructionist perspective, we examine trial-based media events from 2000 to 2016 to reveal dynamic mechanisms through which the state, public, media, and courts collectively construct perceptions of social justice. Specifically, we elaborate on three steps in the justice construction process: externalization, objectivation, and internalization. We demonstrate how contemporary social conflicts and developments in media and legal institutions shape the transition of justice construction processes in trial-based media events. Over the years, while different mechanisms have existed simultaneously, the dominant construction mechanism has transformed from the tabloid justice construction process in the early 2000s, to sympathetic justice construction, to controversial justice construction, and then to collaborative justice construction in 2013. The social construction framework we propose provides not only a dynamic analytic model for the debate between “trial by media” and “media supervision” in existing studies, but also a new perspective to investigate social transition in China.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=699,60,2022,Communication & Society
Isolated Disasters: News Frames and Disaster Narratives of Six Major Accidents,"Yan YAN, Zikun LIU","accident, disaster narrative, disaster memory, news frame","Natural and human-made disasters are important social events, partially because they threaten lives. People rely on media reports for updated information on the processes, losses, and casualties of disasters. They also rely on media narratives for interpretations of attributions, responsibilities, commemorations, and memories of catastrophes. This study explored the news coverage of six major disasters that were officially commemorated by the state in Chinese mainland. The news frames and narrative patterns in the one-year aftermath of these disasters were examined. The results showed that the news frames of the six disasters were event-driven rerecordings of state actions that indicated an official “disaster relief” template at every important time point. The disaster narratives of specific accidents were influenced by both internal and external factors, such as the nature of the accident, regional culture, and the characteristics of the victims. This “individually interpreted” disaster narrative downplayed the effects on the social order, thereby constructing a disaster strategy that was both effectively newsworthy and politically correct.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=698,60,2022,Communication & Society
The Peach Blossom Spring and The Garden of Eden: Cross-Cultural Readings of Li Ziqi’s Videos,"Feila PU, Shengdong LIN","Li Ziqi, encoding/decoding, culture export, cultural imperialism","This study uses textual analysis to analyze and compare online comments in Chinese and English Li Ziqi’s videos shown on Weibo and YouTube. The findings demonstrated that Chinese audiences decoded videos in ways similar to the encoding of the video producers, such as a “Peach Blossom Spring” interpretation, whereas Western audiences presented a “Garden of Eden” interpretation through negotiated decoding. The frameworks of both interpretations were rooted in their respective cultural traditions. The overseas success of Li Ziqi’s videos was not because of a one-way compulsory cultural export or cultural imperialism. Their successful global image may be attributed to the openness of multiple interpretations. The findings of this study may help scholars respond to the “new cultural imperialism” faced by the cross-cultural communication of Chinese culture, as well as reflect on the expected effects of the international communication of Chinese culture. Harmonious but diverse content readings and communication patterns of mutual appreciation, mutual understanding, and mutual respect between cultures should be the goal of intercultural communication. The deep exploration of ambiguous resources could be an effective way to determine the possibility of cross-cultural communication.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=697,60,2022,Communication & Society
Homophily of User-Generated Content in SocialMedia Usage: User Similarity Analysis Based on Sina Weibo,"Xiang XU, Shifan ZHOU, Jing JIN","social media, Sina Weibo, homophily, standardization, computational communication","Social media contain rich information. Although they have been described as decentralized and diversified subcultures, it has been demonstrated that users continue to strengthen homophily in the process of using social media. Such homophily is not generated by a community of individuals. Instead, it focuses on user-generated content on a large scale by all users. Instead of considering homophily aimed at specific individuals, this study focuses on the promotion of an “average similarity” driven by content gravity in the entire field. The study sample comprised 7,825 users of Sina Weibo and their generated content. The phenomenon was examined on three types of homophily: similarity in content, similarity between individuals, and similarity in imitating top users. By calculating the cosine similarity of the sentence vector and the unweighted pairgroup method with arithmetic (UPGMA), we measured the degree of homogeneity. Three variables involvement, activity, and impact—were obtained to categorize different users. Our results showed a correlation between the above two aspects and demonstrated that the three types of homophily were strengthened significantly by involvement in social media.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=696,60,2022,Communication & Society
From Working-Class Culture to Public Culture: Changing National Memories of the Workers’ Cultural Palace (1949–2015),Miao LU,"Workers’ Cultural Palace, working class, state, memory, culture","For the Chinese working class, the Workers’ Cultural Palace (WCP) is an important “site of memory.” Through a discourse analysis of People’s Daily and related policy documents, this study examined the changing national memories of WCP in different historical periods. In the early stage of the new state, the WCP was the “workers’ school and paradise.” It functioned as a venue for propaganda and revolution during the Cultural Revolution. It was where “cultural politics” and “cultural markets” collided in the 1980s and early 1990s, and it was incorporated into the discourse of the “public cultural service system” as China deepened its reform and opening-up. Through the integration, appropriation, and reconstruction of WCP memories, the Chinese state has gradually shifted from the “working-class culture” to the “public culture” and from the class discourse to the citizen discourse. The discursive dyslexia of class and politics provides a unique vantage point to understand the transformations of both the Chinese society and its working class in the past years.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=695,60,2022,Communication & Society
Communication Practice of the Body in Matchmaking Corner: The Absent and the Present,"Yunjie PANG, Shengdong LIN, Changchun XUAN","social space, the body, absent/present, communication practice, matchmaking corner","In the context of China’s modernization, urbanization, and market economy transformation, its single population has continued to increase. As a result, matchmaking corners with parents as the main participants have become increasingly popular in large- and medium-sized cities in China. The matchmaking corner is not only a physical space where parents try to find a wife or husband for their children but also a social space that comprises rich cultural meaning. Parents are physically present at the matchmaking corner to communicate. From the perspective of social space and body, this study uses the matchmaking corner in Shanghai People’s Park as an example to analyze how the absent body is represented and how the present body interacts with the social space as medium, message, and subject. There were two main findings. First, the absent body (adult children) was represented through the form and content of the advertisements that parents placed at the matchmaking corner. Most children were born in the post-80s era. They were well-educated and worked in state-owned enterprises, foreign enterprises, and companies related to finance, banking, and software, nearly 50% of them had registered permanent residences in Shanghai. There were three times as many females as there were males, and the genders were represented differently. Second, the physically present body (old parents) was a medium that, through their clothing and behavior, conveyed information to others about their family and their children’s personalities. The findings showed that, as a subject, the body was not only the gatekeeper of the children’s dating in determining criteria for their potential wife or husband, with whom to interact and what information to disclose. The body had personal needs, such as developing social contacts and social relations, and maintaining physical and mental health. Communication activities related to these needs enriched the matchmaking corner as a social space with diverse meanings. This study contributes theoretically to the “turn to space” and “turn to the body” in communication research. Its findings also shed light on the social reality of the large single population and the aging trend in China.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=91&CA_ID=694,60,2022,Communication & Society

The Visibility of Media Discourse Opportunities of Social Movements in Hong Kong and Its Influencing Factors (2002–2019),"Zhi-Jin ZHONG, Jin-Jin ZHOU","social movement, discourse opportunity, media attention","Media discourse opportunity is a key factor influencing the development and trend of social movements. Based on the analysis of the duration and the amount of media coverage of social movements in Hong Kong from 2002 to 2019, this study identifies 142 appeals of social movements and classifies them into seven categories: political reformation, human rights and freedom, surveillance on government authority, salary and welfare, environment protection, patriotism, and people’s livelihood. By examining the media attention (i.e., the duration and engagement of media coverage) that each appeal receives, this study constructs an operational definition of discourse opportunity visibility and attempts to explore the structural antecedents of this visibility. This study finds social movements in Hong Kong have been driven by diversified appeals. Movements that aim to improve people’s livelihood occur most frequently, while social movements targeting political reformation are the most influential. At the beginning of the Handover, the discourse opportunity visibility of social movements tended to be stable, however, a turnover (sharp increasing trend) occurred in 2006. This study divides the social movements in Hong Kong from 2002 to 2019 according to the strength of discourse opportunity visibility into four stages: 2002–2006, 2007–2011, 2012–2015, 2016–2019, with stage reflecting the characteristics of specific social and historical environments. Among the social movements over the years, the visibility of discourse opportunities obtained by political appeals is significantly higher than other appeals. The concurrent relationships between media agenda, together with the political and economic structural factors, explain the visibility of media discourse opportunities of these social movements.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=92&CA_ID=706,61,2022,Communication & Society
Returning to the Community: Writing Individual Memories into Collective Memory of the Third Front Units in the Era of Social Media—Taking the Wechat Official Account “STJ” as an Example,"Wenjuan XIN, Na ZHANG","social media, collective memory, individual memory, community, the third-front construction","Social media has sparked changes in the structure of communication power and has led to the democratization of memory by empowering ordinary people and bringing the collective memory into the era of civic writing. These decentralized individual memories have become more powerful as they can now be centrally presented. This study examines the case of a third-front unit in Northwest China to investigate memory mode and logical structure of thirdfront builders in the era of social media. The present study finds that social media allows ordinary third-front builders to meet each other in virtual spaces through space-time reconstruction, giving them the power and opportunity to build history. Through writing, interaction, and emotional resonance, these builders constantly turn personal memories into collective memory, reconstruct the imaginary community in the virtual world, strengthen identity, and rebuild spiritual order. Finally, the study summarizes the logic arising from individual memories toward collective memory while pointing out that reconstructing collective memory is an ontological demand of third-front builders and a destination for their identity imagination.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=92&CA_ID=705,61,2022,Communication & Society
The Impact of Internet News Use on Pro-Environmental Behavior: A Moderated-Mediation Model,Zongya LI,"Internet news, pro-environmental behavior, objective knowledge, subjective knowledge, positive emotion","News media plays a crucial role in educating and guiding the public on environmental issues. Studies on the impact of news use on pro-environmental behavior, however, are quite limited and insufficient. Thus, this study proposed a moderated mediation model in an attempt to explore whether the association between Internet news use and pro-environmental behavior was mediated by knowledge levels and positive emotion. Focusing on the issue of haze pollution in China, the results of a survey of 1,589 respondents in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou indicated that Internet news use, subjective knowledge, and objective knowledge were direct predictors of pro-environmental behavior. This study also suggested that Internet news use could contribute to pro-environmental behavior by increasing both subjective knowledge and objective knowledge. Furthermore, this study also found that the mediation effect of subjective knowledge on the association between Internet news use and pro-environmental behavior became stronger when the level of positive emotion was higher. As a result, the moderated mediation model was supported by the present study.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=92&CA_ID=704,61,2022,Communication & Society
Why Does China’s Story Fail to Touch “the Other”? The Deviations and Limitations of China’s Story in Terms of “Breaking Barriers” and “Going Global”,"Min WANG, Lingyao WANG","story of China, international communication, foreigners in China, “the other,” grounded theory","While the globalization of Chinese media has been on the rise in recent years, the external image of China has not been concurrently updated. This highlights the important role of foreigners in China as “the other” (i.e., the intermediaries of communication) and trans-cultural groups in breaking the barriers to promoting the globalization of China’s story. Through in-depth interviews with 27 foreigners in China from eight major civilizations, this study aims to examine the communication deviations and limitations of China’s story from the perspective of “the other.” By analyzing original interview data through grounded theory, the study finds that first, because of the failure in mass communication of China’s story and the stereotypes prevalent in the overseas imagination of China, the image of China suffers from the obscurity of both the media mirror and the mutilated reality. Second, foreigners in China tend to discover and accept the cultural and economic story of a China with weak political attributes, they can, however, correct this communication deviation through a cognition of facts. However, when the newly acquired facts are entangled with their standpoint judgments and political identity or are incompatible with their original values, they show a tacit or resistant attitude, which deepens their stereotypes about China.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=92&CA_ID=703,61,2022,Communication & Society

In this study, a total of 520 valid questionnaires were obtained utilizing a network questionnaire and snowball sampling. The results show that online media attention is a positive predictor of risk perception and behavioral intention. There was no significant correlation between the attention of TV media, risk perception and behavioral intention. The more trust individuals placed on media, the higher their risk perception and behavioral intention.

New Media Use and Online Social Support Acquisition in Cancer Patients,Ziyi LI,"cancer, online social support, new media use","For cancer patients, social support plays a vital and positive role in treatment. This paper adopts the method of depth interview based on the theory of online social support and focuses on cancer patients’ new media use and their online social support acquisition, concentrating on cancer patients’ virtual online world beyond their real life. It also explores the online social support types these patients acquired through their healing process. The study finds that in the Eastern context, the social support theory, which originated in Western society is different from the categories found in old Western studies: cognitive support, companionship support, and esteem support are the most important social support categories that cancer patients strive to obtain following the diagnosis of their illness. Through new media use, cancer patients acquired diverse and abundant online social support, a finding that differs from old social support category research. Viewing entertainment content, the avoidance of disease information, and running away from online communities are the main ways for cancer patients to obtain online social support through new media use, which is deeply influenced by local socio-cultural context. Both the reconstruction of life status and therapeutic beliefs affected by online social support acquisition are worthy of focusing on via related scholars in communication, medicine, and nursing domains.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=92&CA_ID=701,61,2022,Communication & Society

The research results not only verified that uncertainty affects the reputation of the organization but also showed how uncertainty affects the reputation of the organization. The main findings included the following: 1) fear affects anger through risk perception, 2) risk perception affects responsibility through anger, 3) fear triggers risk perceptions, while anger triggers responsibility perceptions, 4) an organization seeking to repair its image/reputation should focus on public perceptions of risk and responsibility, and 5) cognitive-oriented and emotional-oriented modes exist both simultaneously and alternately. The findings of our study contribute to crisis communication theories and have managerial implications, suggesting that a crisis response strategy based on the target audience’s perceptions of risk could foster public-centered thought about crisis communication.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=93&CA_ID=713,62,2022,Communication & Society
The Interface Between Life and Death: Digital Communication with the Deceased,"Hong JIANG, Anqi HU, Xiaxuan FANG","mourning, social media, digital communication, continuing bonds, relationship immortality","Some people continue to leave messages on the deceased's social media, how should we understand this kind of communication? Based on the perspective of the continuing bonds theory in social psychology and previous case studies of “the last Weibo of the deceased Li Wenliang”, this study used structural topic models and a semantic network analysis in computational communication studies to evaluate, describe and understand digital communication practices with the deceased in the Chinese cultural context. The findings showed that comments on Li Wenliang’s last Weibo post could be divided into two topic groups. Most comments were classified in a continuing bonds topic group, accounting for the larger proportion (about77.58%). People directly engaged in daily intersubjective communications with Li Wenliang’s digital avatar. Digital media integrate the various imaginaries of traditional Chinese cultural concepts of the afterlife, becoming a fuzzy and definite interface. In this case, continuing bonds are shaped by media technology and culture. The greatest motivation for digital continuing bonds was related to continuing life. This study introduced the concept of tertiary rétentions to discuss immortality in the era of digital media, not the immortality of individual souls or data but the immortality of relationships based on digital interactions.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=93&CA_ID=712,62,2022,Communication & Society

Reconstructing a Comfortable Zone Online: User’s Self-Presentation in the Practice of Multiple Accounts—The Case of Alternate Weibo Account,"Yun WANG, Sijia LIU","account, Weibo, self-presentation, public","“User is account” is a common consensus in new media studies. Online participation is anchored by account use, which is the mark of people’s presence in social networks. However, multiple accounts in contemporary online spaces present more challenges for researchers in understanding users’ behavior. Focusing on online accounts as a special media typology, this study explored individual actions in the context of multiple accounts and their influence on online participation by investigating the case of alternate account (xiaohao) in Weibo. Using an alternate account indicates strong private, personal, and autonomous intentions, as well as the distinct characteristic of desocialization. However, the users in this study also used new accounts to extend real social relationships, organize subcultural consumption, and establish connections with strangers. Account practices with different demands accelerate the liquidity of personal impression management, redefine social integration boundaries, and strengthen the production of social relations in daily cultural consumption. Considering the expansion of social networks today, future research should focus on the diverse ways in which people present themselves and establish a new typology of production in digital environments in order to map complex interactions between the private and public in the mediatization of everyday life.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=93&CA_ID=710,62,2022,Communication & Society

Therefore, the ideas will no longer be exclusive to the producer. Otherwise, the platform may not be able to estimate the quality of the show to finalize the agreement. This phenomenon is called the Arrow information paradox, based on this theory. This study analyzed the reasons for the difficulty and countermeasures for protecting the creativity of variety shows in China based on data collected in in-depth interviews. The findings showed that several factors, including the lack of a distinct definition of creativity, the imbalance among transaction parties, the nonstandard trading environment, and the obstacles in proving and paying for safeguarding rights, restricting the protection of variety shows during the planning and proposal stage. To some extent, the influence of the Arrow information paradox can be weakened by adding value to creativity, optimizing ways to separate production and broadcasting, and building rational transaction relationships.",http://www.cschinese.com/issueArticle.asp?P_No=93&CA_ID=709,62,2022,Communication & Society

Data collected from an online survey of 4,094 adult respondents in August 2021 demonstrate that exposure to misinformation on popular social media platforms negatively affected respondents’ misbeliefs of and incorrect knowledge of COVID-19 and anti-vaccine attitudes. Moreover, sharing misinformation was found to mediate the relationship of misinformation exposure and cognition and attitudes. When situating these relationships in the four societies, we found that exposure and sharing were less frequent in societies with free access to digital information but more frequent in societies with restricted accessibility.

Alternative media and cultural action do not merely concern patterns and channels of expressing, nor just how minority groups present themselves. On the contrary, they present different life experiences and circumstances and pursue more equal social status. And thus, research and practices involved in alternative media and cultural action should not be confined to the “media” realm and its patterns of action.

Dialogicity of Form in Li Ang’s Erotic Writing: A Discourse Analysis of Genre and Discursive Strategy,Wang Hsiao-yung,"Bakhtin, genre, Autobiography: A Novel, Li Ang, form of erotic writing,dialogicity","This paper is a discourse analysis of the genre and discursive strategies of Li Ang’s erotic writing in Autobiography: A Novel (1999), it analyzes the dialogicity of form of erotic writing and considers its critical consciousness. Unlike previous discussions which seem to have focused on “sex” or have originated from the viewpoint of feminism on personal observations of the historical and social context, this paper argues that Li attempts to deploy a brand-new form of writing, so as to re-present the questions of sex, gender, and “woman” in this piece of erotic writing. Therefore a brand-new discourse analysis, “the form-ideological approach,” is required for Li’s Autobiography: A Novel. This paper finds that Li aims to question the canons of male historiography in terms of its epistemology, narrativity and historical narration by deploying the specific genre and discursive strategies of erotic writing, that is: (1) the genre of the novelized autobiography(whichisa blending offactand fiction),(2)narratorialmulti-voicedness, and (3) an iterational time-texture. Besides this, Li also emphasizes eroticism so as to dismantle the dogmas and norms of male historiography, thereby constructing an alternative historiography, the so-called “her-stories.” Based on the research findings, this paper concludes that the dialogicity of Li’s erotic writing echoes Bakhtinian descriptions of the language process of democratization. This process is, on the one hand, mobilized by the form of the polyphonic novel, on the other hand, it allows for the deconstruction the gender politics of male historiography while reconstructing the form of writing for the purpose of ideological political struggle.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/31fQWNG7hcZ,1.1,2011,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Liquid Journalism and a New Generation of Reporters in Taiwan: A Narrative Approach Based on Zygmunt Bauman’s Theory of Liquid Modernity,"Hua Wan-lin, Tsang Kuo-jen","liquid modernity, journalism, reporter, news media industry, narrative inquiry","Based on sociologist Zygmunt Bauman’s theory of liquid modernity, this article describes, via narrative inquiries, how the new generation of reporters in Taiwan considers their journalist work and their role in today’s media industry. For many years, Bauman has proposed that society has already transformed from the condition of solid, heavy modernity to a liquid, light one, bringing in drastic changes of the relationship between time and space, capitalists and labor. Furthermore he claims that society has moved away from being producer-oriented, and towards emphasizing the consumer, while there has also been a change in ethos from “knowledge is power” to “speed is power.” In terms of Bauman’s theory, this article found that the nature of the journalism profession in Taiwan has changed as society has transformed the condition of liquid modernity, altering broadly how the new generation of reporters treats the value of their work and their role as journalist.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/2NTIOzKDeFU,1.1,2011,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
The Media Experiment of Indigenous Tribal Communication: The “The Village Head’s Microphone” Project in the Lohok Tribe,Lin Fu-yueh,"tribal communication, indigenous communication, Lohok Tribe, alternative media, communication objectivity","Indigenous peoples in Taiwan have long been disadvantaged, thus their communication rights have not been well-protected. “The Village Head’s Microphone” is an experimental communication project carried out by a group of volunteer indigenous MA students in the Lohok Tribe, Yuli Township, Hualien County. These students used the resources in the computer room of an elementary school to teach 10-14 year old children to use their tribal language while they were producing a radio program which people can listen to on the internet and also broadcast via the tribal public address system. The experiment created an opportunity to put indigenous communication rights into practice and to create new tribal communication possibilities.

Carey, this study argues the limitations of traditional journalism history studies to evaluate the achievements of Taiwanese journalism history studies. Whether in the East or the West, both regard journalism as a social institution whose legitimation depends on the accomplishment of democracy and neglect the journalism’s cultural meanings or other social dimensions. This paper proposes to apply the concepts of paradigm and cultural history to reinterpret the historical transformation of journalism. A paradigm not only means a different worldview, but also a distinct scheme based on a specific social imagination, and it is the variety of social imagination that makes multiple journalistic practice and cultural meanings possible.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/aiGI9Aey3mt,1.2,2011,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
The Identifcation Strategies in Ridiculous Religious Broadcasting Programs: A Rhetorical Perspective,Tsai Hong-pin,"identifcation, terministic screen, the rhetoric of rebirth, cluster criticism, a hero’s journey","The study explores the identification rhetorical strategies and the formation of listener identification in ridiculous religious broadcasting programs. The author utilizes the cluster criticism of Kenneth Burke to find clusters of key words in religious broadcasting programs, and takes Joseph Campbell’s model of a hero’s journey to explain the implications of these clusters. After reading and categorizing the artifacts, six clusters emerged. By analyzing these clusters, the author found them to be a metaphor for the structure of heroic adventures, with the speaker representing the hero or God. In fact, by using this trick, the rhetor transforms listeners into followers. Other important concepts of Burke’s thoughts, including consubstantiality, division, dissociation, naming, terministic screen, and the rhetoric of rebirth, are used to rethink the rhetorical/persuasive/identical meanings of artifacts. By doing so, the author proves that the Eastern religious culture bridges the identification between the rhetor and the listeners, and becomes the driving power in forming a community or identification among the listeners of religious broadcasting programs.

This paper takes Southeast Asian migrant workers and new immigrants in Taiwan as the subject of inquiry. Through the observation on their work condition, media representation, and media access in Taiwan, combined with the dialectical analysis on the contemporary meanings of human rights, communication rights, right to access media, and cultural citizenship, the study aims at scrutinizing how international migrant workers/immigrants are imagined and manifested in Taiwan&apos,s communication policies. Furthermore, the study also seeks important references with the basic principles and practices from migration-related communication policies in other countries.

A Mode Transformation Approach to the Effect of Animated News on News Production and Standards: A Pilot Study of News-in-Motion,Chiang Chin-chih,"speech, written text, animated news, mode, visual","This article argues that some controversy concerning ”News-in-Motion” exists in the transformation from written texts to animation. From the perspective of mode transformation, this article focuses on The Apple Daily website&apos,s ”News-in-Motion” section to explore the effect of animated news on traditional news production and standards. This article suggests that when transforming an article from written to animated form, news producers need to add a significant amount of visual and oral detail which influences news gathering and verification. Moreover, visual and oral representations in animated news may imply ideologies just as with written texts, impacting news perception and audience judgment. This article shows that through the implementation of animation culture and techniques, and by at times narrating a news story from first-person perspective via video maneuvers. ”News-in-Motion” not only challenges traditional objective journalism but also invokes ethical discussion related to truth and compassion.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/BLyk4seVb0p,2.1,2012,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
TV Political Discussion and the Interaction Practice between Media and Politics: An Exploratory Study,Tang Shih-che,"Ming-zui, government, political practice, TV political talk shows","In recent years, the political talk show has become a popular genre of programming in Taiwan. Due to its popularity, a few star-like political analysts have been able to make a career out of frequent TV exposure and have earned the title of ”Ming-zui” for their participation in various programs. The study focuses on the phenomenon of Ming-zui in Taiwan and argues that its emergence as a political phenomenon can be traced back to the unique political-economic context of the electronic media in Taiwan. Behind Ming-zui is an institutionalized political practice which involves the economic requirements of the channels, the habitus of media professionals, and the mode of message transmission of the electronic media. The project argues that the Ming-zui phenomenon has given rise to two key aspects with regards to the way the electronic media interacts with politics: One is the instrumental rationalization of political persuasion as a result of the programs&apos, rating competition, the other involves the way political practices respond to the televised political discussion to accommodate to its prevailing influence of the public opinion.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/ZINdh2LiBpR,2.1,2012,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
"The Aesthetic Horizon and Aesthetic Response of Novel Reading Appreciation: Using the Reading Process of Divine Eagle, Gallant Knight as an Example",Lai Yu-chai,"aesthetic response, reception aesthetics, aesthetic expectation, aesthetic horizon","This study begins with a consideration of reception aesthetics, explaining how an audience interacts with ”Divine Eagle, Gallant Knight” via the aesthetic horizon, and describing the type of aesthetic response elicited. The aesthetic horizon may be defined both narrowly and broadly. The narrow definition of aesthetic horizon refers to the genre knowledge grasped and understood by the audience, whereas the broadly-defined aesthetic horizon involves sensory association and life trajectory, both are keys to summoning the reader to involve in the world of the novel. From the perspective of broadly-defined aesthetic horizon, studies have shown that the interpretative activity of the reader traverses multiple media. Therefore, the interpretation of literature of the younger generation occurs via visual and audio media as a reference to artistic perception can serve as an example of broadly-defined aesthetic expectation. In addition to local literature and history that form the deep basis of the interpretative process of the audience, one&apos,s personal reading history, life experiences, and media contact are factors in constructing the aesthetic horizon.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/cCyeUxJrEoh,2.1,2012,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
The Oldness of New Media,Peters John Durham,,"My central question here is what if anything is revolutionary in “new media” -- a vague term encompassing digital or computer-based media from handhelds to cell phones, from Facebook to Google. Over the past decades, we all have been hearing promises about the revolutionary powers of new technologies. A skeptical reaction that there is nothing new under the sun is well deserved. If it’s all so revolutionary, why are the basic problems still the same -- bills, backaches, nasty political campaigns, poverty, and cruelty? Life and death in our era seem to chug blithely along despite all the Jetsonian promises. And though digital media have made communication much easier and faster, there’s little evidence that they have made it any better. The right software can give us unprecedented means of literary and musical composition, but who can match what Shakespeare or Beethoven did with ink and paper?

Does the Internet Open Up New Opportunities for Investigative Reporting? Examining the Business Models of Non-Profit News Organizations in the United States,Hu Yuan-hui,"public commissioning, non-profit business model, crowd-funding, Internet media, investigative reporting","The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms of investigative reporting newly created by non-profit Internet news enterprises that have emerged in the United States over recent years. The study finds that, following the decline of traditional newspapers, the non-profit business model has indeed become an important force for the investigative reporting genre. However, based on case studies of ProPublica and Spot.Us, which represent two types of investigative reporting Websites—philanthropic support and crowd-funding respectively—the study shows that these non-profit news enterprises are still at the stage of solely devoting their efforts to developing or experimenting with new revenue sources in order to deal with the ever-changing media environment. In addition, non-profit news organizations are at the same time influenced by a variety of policy ideologies. These organizations therefore demonstrate quite different developmental features. Facing a similar situation with the role of investigative reporting being either ignored or reduced, Taiwan&apos,s news industry should be able to take advantage of the experiences of other countries to seriously consider the possibilities for developing a non-profit news organizations business model.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/UkwGFoderjR,2.2,2012,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Conflict Management between Migrant Domestic Workers and Their Employers in Taiwan,Lee Pei-wen,"migrant workers, migrant domestic workers, intercultural communication, conflict management, conflict styles","This research aims to explore the causes of conflict and the conflict styles used by migrant domestic workers and their employers in Taiwan. The findings suggest that the main causes of conflict between these two parties are: migrant domestic workers&apos, failure to meet employers&apos, expectations, migrant domestic workers not getting along with care receivers, employers not accepting migrant domestic workers&apos, requests, ineffective communication, migrant domestic workers&apos, unethical behaviors and misconduct, and employers asking for the performance of unreasonable tasks. The interviewed employers were likely to use competing, collaborating, and compromising styles to manage conflicts. Whereas the migrant domestic workers revealed that they tended to use accommodating, indirect collaborating, and collaborating conflict styles, the employers reported otherwise, suggesting that the migrant domestic workers employed in their households often used avoiding and accommodating conflict management styles.

All of these processes have changed rhetorical forms of communication to provide citizens, in today&apos,s highly developed Internet world, with the possibility of the reappearance of the face-to-face contact pattern of traditional society, and rewriting the communication realm as described in Plato&apos,s &quot,The Republic.&quot, During the long quest to accomplish the realm of &quot,The Republic,&quot, rhetorical study used to grant the &quot,philosopher king&quot, and &quot,political leader&quot, the privileged roles of spokespeople for God, making them authoritative informers rather than rhetors. New Criticism, however, imbues rhetorical theory with new life. Rhetorical critics not only inherit the contemporary wave of criticism, but also pride themselves on being rhetors in a fight against unitary despotic thought, providing society with creative thought and the potential impetus for change. Obviously, New Criticism has saved &quot,positions&quot, for general audiences. It believes that rhetorical criticism awakens introspection, which inspires the potential capabilities of audiences, turns audiences into rhetors, and implements action and dialogue. It is the use of a win-win communication philosophy, created by &quot,an invitational rhetoric,&quot, that could achieve the expectation of the citizen/audience as rhetors.

The media market, increasingly dominated by a few conglomerates, presents a pressing issue for the society. To help address it, this essay focuses on two intertwined questions: How to prevent media consolidation? How to promote media diversity? With concepts of media consolidation and media diversity discussed first, the author takes stock of existing regulations on media concentration as currently exercised in Taiwan and some other countries. He then examines the various practices and regulations pertinent to measuring media concentration. The article concludes by proposing a &quot,compound&quot, approach of media regulation so as to achieve the multiple aims of media consolidation prevention as well as media diversity promotion. It calls for the necessary policy modifications in structural, behavioral and content regulation.

A Comparative Study of the 2003 Anti-Deregulation Movement in US and the 2011-2013 Anti-Media Monopoly Movement in Taiwan,Chang Chin-hwa,"media mergers, the anti-media monopoly movement, media reform movement, the Chinese element","Beginning from September 2011, Taiwan&apos,s anti-Want Want China Times Monopoly movement culminated in September 2012 as a big demonstration event involving nearly 9,000 participants. Across the Pacific Ocean, a similar movement occurred, back in 2003, as US citizens shared similar indignations toward media monopoly, which has become ever more intensified under the trend of digital convergence and globalization. Both movements won popular supports from their respective society, with similar appeals against the collusion between media conglomerates and political elites. Both succeeded in shaping the public discourse of media reform, with various civil groups gauged and coordinated via the Internet, and the complexity of legislative processes well in progress.Given all these similarities between the two, there is nonetheless one particular difference in Taiwan&apos,s movement. That is, the so called &quot,China element&quot, actually underlined all sounds and furies about the Want Want China Times merger controversy.

Following a close study of relevant codes and acts in Communication Law, the author reveals that current regulations are indeed inadequate. With codes and acts merely sporadic, and thresholds set too low, issues arising from cross-media mergers and acquisitions are left unaddressed, therefore difficult to deal with. Whereas the communication law as a whole fails to provide clear and appropriate standards, the Supreme Administrative Court in Taiwan does make clear that, under current legal regime, the National Communication Council has discretion in deciding whether to approve an application for ownership transfer of TV and broadcasting media. This article argues that Taiwan shall adopt a duo-framework to regulate cross-media ownership transfer. With legislation as the first frame, clear and specific rules need be enacted in order, then followed by the administration authority (the NCC) as the second frame, which assures the routine reviewing process with sufficient stability and flexibility.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/CiJeSNcmlOL,3.2,2013,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

How in a specific case, various aspects of public interests are addressed in the political process? Taking as example the famous News Corp/BSkyB merger case, this paper examines how UK&apos,s media merger regulatory regime really works. Having analyzed the political process in this case, the author makes clear that in UK regulations, media mergers are considered as something to do with special public interests, which are not only economic-such as market competition, but also socio-political- such as democratic diversity and social responsibilities.As laid out in the regulatory framework, the News Corp/BskyB merger should go through the public interests test, despites the alliance between Conservative Party and Rupert Murdock. Activists who argued against the case were based more on plurality-related values in the beginning, but then concerned more with values of social responsibilities (&quot,fit and proper&quot,) after the phone hacking scandal broke out.

Regulation on Media Ownership Concentration: Two US Cases and Their Implications,Hung Chen-ling,"public interest, ownership, media concentration, merger, monopoly","For those who support media mergers and ownership transfers in Taiwan, the trend of digital convergence seems inevitable, and the benefits of open market irresistible. Usually with US deregulation experiences as reference, Taiwan government has approved several application cases, ignoring the fact that protecting public interests remains the backbone of US media regulation policies. This article examines two major media merger cases in the US, and analyzes the criteria applied and the procedure followed by the FCC in reviewing them. The author makes clear that the FCC, while lifting restrictions on cross-media ownership, nonetheless establishes a balancing test to secure public interests. On the one hand there are strict regulations to ensure fair competitions among media corporations, while on the other hand civil participations and public debates are required so as to guarantee the transparency of the reviewing procedure. In conclusion, the article pinpoints the deficiencies in Taiwan&apos,s regulations for media mergers and ownership transfers: an obvious shortage of fair-game rules and of credible industry information, no clear criteria and procedure for reviewing application cases, no open public debates with adequate civil participation.

It indicates that for users, social network sites function as a fluid space, where privacy is necessarily context-varying, therefore inevitably different in implications. This tends to be ignored by privacy researchers, however, such that there exists a &apos,privacy paradox&apos, in the bulk of privacy research. Addressing this paradox issue with a user-centered perspective, the author focuses on users&apos, privacy management policies, and finds a &quot,control paradox&quot, among privacy-conscious users regarding who is to blame for privacy violation. The paper then gives a literature review of Facebook privacy research in Taiwan, with methodologies discussed comparatively among relevant studies, local and abroad.

Capital Flow/Competition of Military Pundits on Domestic Political Talkshows: A Discursive Analysis of Talkshow Episodes on Major Military-Law Events in 2011,Tsui Ai-mei,"capital flow, military pundits, political talkshows, the defense ministry, media arena","To compete for survival and prosperity on TV arena, each political talkshow has its own list of star pundits similar in traits as its target audiences. By providing them topics and exposure opportunities, the talkshow creates for these pundits a space of capital flow, which means differently types of capitals become interchangeable. Eventually, all capital exchanges serve but to secure most favorable social positions for acquiring most lucrative economic capitals. In strong contrast, the Defense Ministry tends to rely on symbolic capitals to ensure their professional prestige and authority, so as to win the trust of the people. This paper asks what kinds of conflicts could be expected when these two scenarios clash on military topics, as advantages and disadvantages in capital use from both sides necessarily decide what get interpreted and circulated on TV.

The focus is on how these two parties interpret the disparities. A total of 23 local Taiwanese students and 23 Mainland students were interviewed. The results show that the major differences of social identities experienced by Mainland students were &quot,ethnic identity&quot, and &quot,national and political identity,&quot, a finding quite inconsistent with those of previous research. As to Taiwanese students, the differences were felt more strongly in &quot,student identity,&quot, which involves teamwork values, and &quot,socio-economic and single-child identity.&quot, For Taiwanese students, these two factors had more impact on their intergroup communication.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/p279vGLNHOy,4.1,2014,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Independent Journalists in the Internet Era: Their Survival Strategies and Mutual Assistance Mechanisms,Chen Shun-hsiao,"independent journalists, freelance, independent media, independent journalism","The Internet era brings up new possibilities for Taiwan journalists looking for more professional independence from mainstream media. Based on in-depth interviews with 21 representative cases, this article investigates their survival strategies and mutual assistance mechanisms. The results show that independent journalists tend to survive on a combined mode, with multiple jobs and incomes for maintaining livelihoods. Their sources of incomes include: freelance payments by mainstream media and independent media, royalties from their published books or related products, earnings from activities subsidized by government, non-profit organizations, or from professional services for academic institutes, etc. Independent journalists who used to struggle alone have started to cooperate among themselves with mutual supports. Now they have weReport raising funds for news interviews, Independent Journalists Association offering training programs, and Journalists Union taking care of their insurance needs. They share a relationship of symbiosis with these various forms of organizations. While working outside of mass media, these independent journalists could still cooperate with those who share similar independent spirits, media organizations or journalists alike. Normally, they would freelance to these media, co-produce news with their journalists, and fight together for their common labor rights, hoping to strengthen the ecosystem of independent journalism.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/ilLFExaGz5S,4.2,2014,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Beyond Campus Borders: Transition from Campus-Focused Media to Community-Oriented Media,Hu Yuan-hui,"campus media, community-oriented media, citizen journalism, citizen participation","While journalism today confronts a challenging future under strong impacts, colleges and universities have been one of the new forces shaping the reconstruction of the news industry in the U.S. Intrigued by this developing phenomenon, the author investigates how U.S. colleges and universities play their roles in the process. The results show that many U.S. colleges and universities recognize their important roles in community development, and endeavor to transform their campus media through multiple approaches. Previously student-run and campus-focused, these school media gradually become community-oriented and serving their neighborhoods. In strong contrast, campus media in Taiwan do not seem to share similar transformation. Currently, they still serve mainly as student internship vehicles, even if the local news industry, facing drastic change and under similar impacts, anticipates its share of ecological reconstruction. While there is no shortage of campus media who cover and serve their neighborhoods, they mostly consider themselves as extensions of classroom teachings. Many faculty supervisors of these campus media do recognize the value of ?embracing the community.? Nonetheless, obstacles remain and determination for a transformation is still delayed.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/1yFHUdPVENX,4.2,2014,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Involving digital technology, software, and visual devices in news reporting, it takes a special journalistic storytelling sensibility that would combine both computer software and traditional crafts as seamlessly as possible. Based on participatory observation and in-depth interviews, this paper explores the interactions between graduate students from journalism and those from computer science, hoping to find something inspiring for journalism education in the near future.

Reviewing the Professional Roles of Taiwan Journalists from News Awards Conferred 1974-2013,Chiu Chia-yi,"news awards, journalistic professionalism, changing roles of Taiwan journalist, structural constraints, regulatory mechanisms","News awards are meant to promote journalistic professionalism and advocate cherished values or awareness. In reality, however, this might not always be the case. Based on a close study of the conferring of Taiwan&apos,s mainstream news awards, such as Zeng Xu-bai News Prize, Golden Tripod Prize, Vivian Wu Prize, Excellency for Journalism Prize, during the period of 1974-2013, this essay shows that the Year 2000 marks a watershed which implies changing professional roles for Taiwan journalists. Before 2000, reasons for conferring these awards actually promoted/advocated little, especially if compared with what got consciously conveyed by those awarded individual journalists in their self-portrait narratives and their respective awarded pieces. After 2000, the scenario began to change, as these awards tended to favor nonmainstream, alternative news media and professionals fighting for journalistic ideals and principles in an increasingly difficult environment. The conferring of news awards thus served as tokens of official supports and encouragements. With this contrast, the author explains the classical tensions between structure and agency as experienced by local journalists in their professional practices. Characterized by their respective socialization process, grass-root engagements and on-going self-reflections as conscious agents, individual journalists were inevitably caught in tensions and conflicts between their professional practices and structural constraints. News awards, being extensions of state political powers, symbolize such top-down structural constraints with specific regulatory mechanisms. The author therefore concludes that, until the structure itself changes and its grip loosened, such tensions would not be truly resolved.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/Xy6LnIuopzr,4.2,2014,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Thus, Al Jazeera not only invites viewers to experience the world differently, but also participates in shaping world politics. Being a global establishment comparable to CNN and BBC World, it has become a symbol of daring spirits integrating new media such as satellite TV, internet Website, and blogs. This paper concludes by suggesting a scenario for the Chinese World: Is an equivalent global presence possible at all, strong enough to challenge the Western hegemony in news agenda and news narratives?",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/Izuem1OD2qg,4.2,2014,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Drawing on the perspectives of textual poaching and gender performance, it asks whether transvestitism merely a temporary gender transgression, or a specific tactics aiming to dismantle the compulsory categorization of sex inherent in the gendered socio-culture. Based on semi-structured interviews, the author finds cosplay transvestites have to follow in-group rules which tend to echo mainstream gender values. The imaginary space deriving from transvestitism, however, does play an important role in the process of (male) cosplay transvestites&apos, gender identification, as multiple or flexible gender values could be encouraged and introduced in real life.

"The Consented Free Labor: Game, Obedience, and Amateurs’ Pop Star Dream in Taiwan Talent Search Shows",Jian Miao-ju,"Taiwan talent search shows, free labors, pop star dream, amateurs, dispensable celebrities","Talent search shows have been quite a hit over the past decade in Taiwan. Against a background of industry crisis with both music and television industries facing severe challenges, TV stations set up a new profit model via cross media integration, and function as ?star factories? for aspiring amateurs. Like all reality TV shows with audience participation appeals, these programs attract the willing contribution of amateur contestants, who, with pop star dream to realize, patiently and obediently endure the whole process of ?talent search? game while assiduously investing their time, energy, money, talents and creativity. This paper explains how these amateur aspirants are actually being exploited as acquiescent labors, and then further degraded into the status of dispensable celebrities with a mere 15 minutes of media spotlight. The author argues that, behind the flamboyant stardom suggested by talent search shows, there is the disguised recruitment of free labor for calculative profiteering. Amateur aspirants are actually coaxed into willing cooperation and obedient dedication in the name of self-investment. To conclude, the author points out that, while it is very characteristic of the media industry to engage amateur contestants in such an exploitative relationship, the phenomenon is but a miniature of the highly hierarchical power structure typical of the media entertainment industry.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/bq7SrJOUHDj,5.1,2015,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Analyzing the Commodification Process of Facebook Users and Their Non-Material Labors,"Liu Pei-ci, Wang Wei-ching","Facebook, non-material labors, tracking and monitoring techniques, commodification process, commodification of labor","Facebook adopts real name registration policy. As a result, Facebook users have their online personal information corresponding to their offline real life. The contents they create on the social media website become solid capital for Facebook. Using a political economy approach, this paper analyzes the kind of commercialization process Facebook users and the contents they create have gone through. The authors show that, via tracking and monitoring techniques, Facebook actively accumulates and appropriates its users&apos, personal data and online behaviors for advertising profiteering. The whole process is then rationalized by the digital contracts Facebook requests its users to sign. Thus, users become consumers as well as producers who, engaged in non-material labors while in the meantime being commercialized for sale, eventually consume the advertised products. The authors also warn that the end of user privacy is to be expected, with Facebook&apos,s monitoring operations ever more intensified.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/rkBZ5sHOVyR,5.1,2015,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Fighting for Press Freedom: Korean Journalist Organizations and Their Struggles,"Liu Chang-de, Tian Yu-jhih","Korea, media workers unions, labor movement, politics","This paper introduces various Korean journalist organizations in their struggles for press freedom. Through in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis, it presents these organizations in terms of their respective organizational profiles, priorities, external political and economic connections, and internal relationships with the management. Based on a research framework of ?market-class-society/politics,? the authors explore the roles played and strategies adopted by these organizations in labor movements. Results show that there are significant differences among media union coalitions, journalist groups, public broadcasting unions, commercial broadcasting unions. As professional groups, the Korean Journalist Association is relatively moderate in political stands and strategies, while labor unions are relatively radical, more inclined to cooperate with pro-democracy oppositions. Appealing for ?impartial broadcasting,? media worker unions fight mainly for editorial independence, and have held several strikes against interventions from the conservative government. For their part, the two major public broadcasting unions are split in their fights, having been penetrated by conservativists. Fighting against one another tends to be characteristic of these Korean journalist organizations in recent years.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/zSQO9HkUPmJ,5.1,2015,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

As one of important mobile music devices following car stereo and Walkman, it has brought about great changes and breakthroughs, in terms of mobility, aesthetics and functions. This essay critically explores the trajectory of its mutation and the accompanied impacts, by drawing on media ecologist Paul Levinson&apos,s three-stage metamorphosis of technological media from toy to mirror of reality and then to midwife of art. Accordingly, iPod has a quite transient toy period in its early stage, seen mainly as a new gadget. With the emergence of iPhone, attentions turned more to its real content, marking its mirror period. Then with the advent of iPad, all technological features from the two previous stages were integrated. What remained covert before started to become obvious.

How Alternative Media Survive the Era of Mobile Social Media: A Case Study of Taiwan Lihpao Daily,Chang John,"Taiwan Lihpao Daily, mobile social media, Shih Hsin University, alternative media","Taiwan Lihpao Daily has been functioning as an alternative medium ever since 1988 when it was launched by She-wo Cheng, the founder of Shih Hsin University. Doggedly embracing the journalistic ideals for social reform, it also serves to showcase the university long famous for its emphases on media and communication. Used to focus on print publishing, however, Taiwan Lihpao Daily now faces multiple challenges both inside and outside. Internal constraints are strongly felt, as the sea change caused by ever-innovating communication technologies makes it necessary to reallocate resources for news gatherings and editing. Equally troubling is the fact that its university patron currently undergoes the ordeals of high education policy uncertainty and low birth-rate impacts. This essay examines how this long print-based alternative medium would fight for its own survival in the era of mobile device, smartphone, and social media.

Considered as mouthpieces of colonial empires, however, they haven&apos,t been recognized as part of China&apos,s press worthy of scholarly attentions. Typically with multi-national backgrounds and intensely competing with one another, these English-language newspapers were the kind of media hard to control, which naturally made them valuable outreach resources for the Nanjing KMT government with its international propaganda purposes to serve. Intrigued by this particular role played by these treatyport newspapers, the essay examines first the complicated media environment for their operations. It then explores how the Nanjing KMT government endeavored to regulate and penetrate these newspapers before the outbreak of the full-scale Sino-Japanese War. Characterized by their ambiguity in media identity and the obscurity of their news sources, these treaty-port newspapers somehow influenced those KMT officers who sought to voice through them. Various KMT groups and factions tended to conceal their party links and factional identities in order to secure smooth penetrations. Such penetrations not only greatly expanded the Nanjing KMT government&apos,s information contacts and networks, but also laid the foundation for the covert news policy endorsed by Hollington Tong after the outbreak of the full-scale Sino-Japanese War.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/FDGIWphY1Hk,5.1,2015,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

A majority of these instructors do hold Ph.D. degrees, and mostly related with media and communication, while quite some others are armed with hands-on experiences in media practices.

Higher Education System in Transition and Implications for Doctorate Employments: An Agency Perspective,Liu Chung-po,"employment for PhDs, alternative academics, casualization of academic labor","Studies on doctorate employments rarely pay attentions to Ph.D. students especially in humanities and social sciences. Confronted with ever-changing environments, Ph.D. students must learn to meet the needs of job markets. A good grasp of their job perspectives as students would eventually help solve doctorate employment problems. This paper therefore explores how Ph.D. students in humanities and social sciences normally experience the long course of doctoral study in Taiwan and whether such experiences and trainings sufficiently prepare them for eventual employments. In contrast to old studies that are mainly structure-oriented, the author explores from the perspectives of agency, while significantly based on personal experiences. He argues that Ph.D. programs should help Ph.D. students in a way more directly and efficiently, by providing employment information not just limited within Taiwan, that the government should take seriously the tendency of ?casualization of academic labor? and improve job conditions for Ph.D. degree-holders.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/itbUpqd7jFG,5.2,2015,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

This paper explores how the mismatch issues got reported by different news media. Based on a comparative discourse analysis of ?United Daily News?, ?China Times? and ?Apple Daily?, the author finds that the three newspapers do vary significantly in terms of reporting style, content and ideology. While ?United Daily? and ?China Times? show more editorial controls, ?Apple Daily? tended to be liberal if anti-intellectual, featuring more interviews and testimonials. It therefore allowed the reported persons to apply their narrative tactics which sometimes could eventually create celebrity effects and change the previous social stigma, as exemplified by ?doctor selling chicken-steaks.?

Absence of Diversity Values: Rethinking Internships in Communication Education,Kuang Chung-hsiang,"diversity values, enduring values, media stigmatization, communication education, internships","Why minority groups tend to be stigmatized on media? To explain it fairly and fully, one should not stay limited to the process of news production. Instead, one needs to consider the enduring values held by media professionals as a collective. Drawing on Herbert Gans, this paper asserts that journalists hold dear the ?enduring values? formulated by their cultural experiences and cultivated in their educational process. This suggests that much can be done in communication education for boosting multicultural values and perspectives. By appropriating cultural activism in approach, internship programs can be designed in a way like field study so that students are exposed to the life-worlds of various socio-cultural groups. Thus, cultural diversity can be experienced and understood first-handedly from the angle of minority groups as the reported.

This paper explores this adaptation process, based on a case study of the film [Hugo] from the picture-book ?The Invention of Hugo Cabret?, by focusing on the potentials of picture-books as transmedia narratives. Typically combining graphics and text in its print format, the picture-book is actually rich in intermediality useful for the adaptation. Thus, the text of the picture book, used to fill in where the visual scene might lack, could be actualized by the narrator in the film to enhance the immediacy of the scene as reality. By specifying the role ?intermediality? plays in the process, the author identifies several adaptation mechanisms at work, which suggests what needs to be considered in transmedia narratology.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/tCdX0EBMWF3,5.2,2015,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

This article contends that digital media and the logic of connective action can empower a movement through allowing wider participation, but simultaneously can lead to decentralization of a movement, increasing the difficulty of strategic decision-making by movement leaders. Analyzing data from an onsite survey of protesters, the article shows the extent of participant participation in digital media activities.

From keying to interpretative packaging, the news and views of mass media, especially commercial newspapers and independent media, were important in the process of the movement. Based on field observation and empirical analysis of news discourses, this study contends that the movement had been keyed one way or the other from the beginning that delimited the boundaries of various interpretative packages articulated by both the commercial and independent media for the duration of the movement. From objective to mediated reality, the discursive boundaries in the news media oscillated between nationalism and rooted cosmopolitanism. The common thread is their populist approach to catering to the sentiments of Hong Kong citizens via discursive practices that created a dichotomous or us-versus-them configuration to woo the citizens at large.

Many journalists in Taiwan persecution of suspected communists in the 1950 ~ 1970s is coined as modern witch-hunt. A similar ?witch-hunt? occurred in Taiwan. In 1949, the Chang Kai-Shek regime set back to Taiwan after being defeated by the Communists in Mainland China. In the same time, a large-scale witching hunting to the intellectuals and dissents was conducted around the Island as part of the strategies to keep Chang’s regime. In the following one fourth century, hundreds of journalists were accused of being ?participating subversive political events? and sanctioned by the court martial.

The Development and Challenges of Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News (1945 ~ 1972),Yang Hsiu-chin,"Lee Wan-chu, Hsieh Ran Zhi, Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News","This paper discusses the development and challenges of Taiwan Shin Sheng Daily News (TSSDNEWS, the official newspaper of the Taiwan Provincial Government) from 1945 to 1972. In this period, TSSDNEWS was gradually manipulated by the mainlanders. After the February 28 Incident, the mainlanders came to occupy the key positions in TSSDNEWS. However, TSSDNEWS continued to lose market share. TSSDNEWS lost its superiority because of the press ban, the competition from the Central Daily News (the official newspaper of KMT) and the loss of its monopolistic access to the advertising budget of the Taiwan Provincial Government. Hsieh Ran Zhi, the main operator of TSSDNEWS, lost the support of the Taiwan Provincial Government after Chen Cheng was dismissed as Governor of Taiwan Province. This situation made it more difficult for Hsieh to promote reform. TSSDNEWS followed the business strategy of private newspapers in an attempt to increase its revenue in the 1960s. For Hsieh, journalism educator and promotor of KMT press policy, this was a path full of contradiction and compromise.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/5BGYq98utJS,6.2,2016,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Different Speeds and Relay Networks: Telegraphy and Society in Early Colonial Taiwan,Hsiao Hsu-chih,"different speeds, relay networks, telegraphy, society, media","In colonial Taiwan, the establishment of the postal system, railways, telegraphy, telephone system, newspapers, wireless radio, as well as other mass media built up an information landscape of colonial modernity. Communication technologies in the 19th century were based on electromagnet, and not only could send/receive messages or reach the furthest edges of empire, but could also attract and conflate different social components. These communication technologies thus facilitated the transmission and transport necessary to the working of the postal system, the real-time synchronization of Japanese and Taiwanese news, and the mobilization of information in markets for everything from labor to grain. In terms of time-space convergence, the information flows occurred in an environment of geographical segregation. However, different media needed different relay networks for information transport, even multi-linguistic translation activities. This article will present stories about the uneven transportation speed of messages, technology-inspired desire for social mobilization and ambiguous bilingual translation in that era.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/MNT0oHvOdnk,6.2,2016,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Propaganda and Agitation: Farmers’ and Workers’Movements and Linguistic Experimentation Related to Writing Taiwanese in Sanziji,Chen Shu-jung,"Sanziji, left-wing, workers’ and farmers’ movements, Taiwanese language and writing, written Chinese","Sanziji was a work with a propaganda writing style which emulated that of ancient Chinese three-character style and was widely practiced in writing Taiwanese by Taiwan Red Rescue Association in the 1930s. Sanziji was banned by Japanese colonial government for its connection with communism. By analyzing Sanziji created in the heydays of a literary movement that highlighted countryside, land, and local languages, this paper examines how this Taiwanese writing style as an experimentation for mass mobilization was practiced on the sites of Farmers’ and workers’ movements. This paper investigates the incident of Taiwan Red Rescue Association and the political implications of Sanziji, analyzing the form and content of Sanziji and the regional significance of this three-character style communication. Sanziji embodied a Taiwanese writing which was able to accommodate both Japanese Kanzi and the recently invented terminologies. This writing style, making possible the consistency of literacy/orality, transformed into a mobilizing force that touched people’s hearts in the subaltern class. This paper argues that Sanziji invoked an ancient style to challenge the hierarchy of literacy/orality and turned into an instrument for ideological propaganda and mobilization.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/eCvQIi71LaE,6.2,2016,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

An online survey (N = 1,160) was conducted on the members of Pansci Facebook Fan Page to explore their usage patterns, motivations of use, and participatory behaviors. The results indicated that Pansci use was positively associated with both forms of participation. Additionally, public participation was also affected by users’ motivations. If the users accessed Pansci Facebook Fan Page for the purpose of socializing, their likelihood in engaging in both forms of participation may be increased. However, recreational, selfidentity, and informational motivations were only linked to civic participation.

However, limited research attention has been paid to this topic. This study uses the perspectives of advocacy strategies, the reciprocity principle from public deliberation and message argument quality to analyze the ?Anti- Seal Product? campaign promoted by Environment and Animal Society of Taiwan (EAST). Results show that EAST used cooperation, embarrassment, and information strategies to promote this appeal. Promotional texts from EAST emphasized moral reasoning, evidence and logical consistency, particularly reciprocity and strong arguments, which helped reporters cover the appeal and also helped the public understand and support it. This suggests that to successfully advocate causes citizen groups must invest in research work to gather information and evidence.

Not only “of the People” but also “by the People”: Building Public Advisory Bodies within Public Service Media,Hu Yuan-hui,"public service media, public service broadcasting, public participation, media accountability, Public Television Service (Taiwan)","With significant shifts in the business operation environment, public service media in many countries are also undergoing some changes in their mechanisms of public participation in decision making. Besides recruiting representatives of citizen groups into executive or supervisory boards to allow them direct involvement in decision making, the public service media in some countries in addition establish advisory bodies in order to closely monitor public demand and perception. The findings of this study show that U.K.’s BBC, Republic of Ireland’s RTE, Australia’s ABC, and Korea’s KBS are among the examples. Those public advisory bodies may be different in their structure, functions and methods of operation, but all are legislated bodies. Except for KBS (whose selected members are more elite oriented), others have their membership designed for regional representation. Those bodies therefore play a significant role as a bridge between the public service media and the people they serve. However, the position of a public advisory body can make its role in the public service media’s decision making ambiguous. Sometimes it cannot help but fall into the subtle power relations between them. Furthermore how public service media in the digital age advances its publicness through the advisory body remains open for exploration and examination.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/Gq3nuapt4Rz,6.2,2016,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
How Message Framing and Presentation Affect Pro-Environmental Behavioral Intentions: A Dual- Pathway Model Perspective,Shih Tsung-jen,"perceived efficacy, climate change, collective action, pro-environmental behaviors, dual-pathway model","Whether the negative impact of climate change can be effectively mitigated depends heavily on degree of individual engagement in environmental-friendly behaviors. This study draws on the dual pathway model, which emphasizes the role of negative emotions and different forms of efficacy, to investigate how to facilitate mitigation actions. Through an experiment involving 211 people recruited at a large public university in northern Taiwan, this study found both emotion-focused coping and problem-focused coping to be possible pathways leading to mitigation actions related to climate change. Regarding emotion-focused coping, the findings indicate that framing climate change as a local issue increased its perceived relevance, which, in turn, stimulated negative emotions and behavioral intentions. On the other hand, providing action cues in messages increased knowledge of action strategies, and so triggered different forms of efficacy and behavioral intentions, a case of problem-focused coping. The results also indicate that negative emotions interacted with various forms of efficacy to shape intentions. The effect of negative emotions was stronger for people low in response efficacy and collective efficacy, suggesting the role of efficacy may not be monotonous.

The impacts of drought are obtrusive and link to our everyday experience. This paper adopts the corpus method to investigate how three major Taiwanese newspapers represented drought during Taiwan’s most serious drought of the past decade, occurring from late 2014 to mid-2015. Nine-hundred and forty-one drought reports are collected to create a small corpus for analysis. The findings show that newspapers tend to focus their drought coverage on the supply side, specifically on short term changes in the water levels of major reservoirs and on rainfall. Metaphors of battle and war are frequently used in drought reports, particularly the term ?drought-proofing,? which implies that societies must fight drought, instead of presenting drought as a long term risk to which societies should respond by seeking methods of co-existence or adaptation. Terms such as climate change and risk perception usually appear only in the background of drought reports, making them nearly invisible. The study suggests Taiwanese media should pay more regular attention to the demand side aspect of water management, including water saving practices. Moreover, media reports should treat drought as a normal climate phenomenon rather than an aberration.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/k8PVivzKG5H,7.1,2017,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

This paper respectively adopted a longitudinal approach (1997 ~ 2014) and the cross-sectional approach (during 2014) to explore the relationships between corporate communication on environment related issues and news representation. From 1997 to 2014, media coverage of longitudinal trends showed that energy issues related to corporations peaked in 2008, with the ?Economic Daily? having the most coverage. Regarding the cross-sectional aspect, content analysis was performed on a total of 279 news stories sampled from Taiwanese print media and dealing with the hundred largest enterprises in Taiwan. This study found the theme of ?low carbon and energy saving products? to be the major news topic. The news stories were more focused on traditional energy than other energy types, and corporate people were the predominant sources. The most common news frame was ?commercial green,? namely the description of new energy products and new technology innovation. The results indicate that corporate communication of energy-related issues tended to favor the commercial interests of corporations.

This research combined the theoretical perspectives of environmental justice and science and technology studies (STS) to explore risk assessment and the regulatory controversies related to nuclear waste, and how citizen action challenges official scientific claims and problems of environmental injustice. The case highlights the risk knowledge gap, the interplay of multiple injustices, and the problem of undone science. Different generations of indigenous antinuclear waste activists on Orchid Island have collaborated with expert activists and antinuclear organizations to form hybrid antinuclear alliances. These groups took action to express their demands and challenged official regulatory standards and test methods. The complex interest network of nuclear regulatory and research institutions has weakened the credibility of scientific knowledge production and the release of risk information. Institutional design must empower local indigenous people to play a critical role in knowledge production and nuclear waste governance and health risk assessment to seek a solution that is responsive to the local social and cultural rationales and distributive equity.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/fJ7jsIeEZLm,7.1,2017,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

In these documentaries, three directors used different methods (just like oral history, companion or participant observation) to represent traumatic memories, experiences or narratives of subjects (whether Taiwanese-Japanese-soldiers, South Korean ?Military Comfort Women? or Japanese soldiers) under imperialism. The whole cultural production (from shooting, editing to screening) of documentaries thus became some kind of healing conversation in the psychoanalysis therapy.

The Southern Weekly and Southern Metropolis Daily are both found to have relatively free environments, though engagement in political games with the government authority remains necessary. The group leaders often play a dual role as both regulators and protesters, and advocate news professionalism. The leadership characteristics of those who pursue professionalism in news are as follows: ?Hiring journalists regardless of their educational background, while emphasizing their literary talent,? ?portrayal of liberal ideas, to pursue more space for news freedom,? designing a hierarchical leadership mainly to protect journalists,? and ?employing internal competition mechanisms and flexible reward systems to enhance the journalists&apos, performance.?

With regard to measurement variables, the total revenue of channel agencies would be the best means of representing the relative rankings of agencies within the market, and is the best way to identify the market leader. However, total revenue is a business secret of the channel agents and is unavailable in practice. Therefore, both published advertising prices and TV channel ratings can serve as proxies to reflect the importance of individual channels. Relatively, as measurement methods, the traditional CR_4 and CR_8 measures, which use the datum of only the top four or top eight channel agents, might not only ignore vital information, but also might not reflect the practical situation of market distribution.

The article is intended as an explorative review of Kittler’s works on media theory. The discussion is divided into two parts. The first part situates Kittler in the lineage of Germanistic philosophy of technology since the late nineteenth century, and presents a synopsis of how it came to bear upon the study of cultural technology following the diversification of audio-visual devices in the 1970s. The second part then focuses on Friedrich Kittler’s media theory, explicating how Kittler’s materialistic take on media and culture informs contemporary theorizing about media communication.

The focus is on the character of the computer as technological media and the meanings it represents: computers themselves becoming subjects, as well as being the medium to rule and end all media. When computers develop in this manner, Kittler’s media theory puts emphasis on how computers operate upon humans, and this situation faced by humans. Thus, the second part of the essay discusses the hardware operation and software function of computers, and their relations with humans in Kittler’s media theory, as Kittler demonstrates how computers “determine our situation.” Moreover, the essay deliberates on how the concepts of power and ethics relate to Kittler’s media theory that regards computer as technological media.

Eschatological Prophets in Media History: Friedrich Kittler and Marshall McLuhan on Media Technology,Huang Shun-shing,"Friedrich Kittler, Marshall McLuhan, media history, technological determinism","In the 1960s, media scholar Marshall McLuhan claimed “the medium is the message,” emphasizing the influence of media on civilization. McLuhan understood that media are not simply mechanical objects but profoundly human responses to sensory. Thirty years later, the German media theorist Friedrich Kittler adopted a radical “technological a priori” attitude, and asserted that “media determine our situation.” In Kittler’s archaeology of media, the passage from writing to new “mechanical storage technologies” -- in other words, from the Gutenberg galaxy to the Marconi constellation -- is not simply a mutation in the history of aesthetics but a revolution in the mass media as technologies of power. Beginning with the somewhat similar propositions of these two theorists regarding the historical development of media, this article examines media history, focusing on how McLuhan and Kittler discussed media dominance and the influence of media power. Finally, drawing on critiques of technological determinism, this article discussed and reflected on the significance of McLuhan and Kittler for media theories and research on media history.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/pPRDadUbMNT,7.2,2017,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

In the second part, I set up “generalized symbolic exchange media” as the problematics to present three different positions in contemporary social theory, comparing their distinct answers to questions concerning the theoretical places of culture and mass media. Based on comparison of these three different social theory perspectives, I argue that Niklas Luhmann’s social system theory can be a crucial link to connect social theorists with the media theorist Kittler. In the third part, I separately introduce Kittler’s distinction of “traditional media/technical media” and Luhmann’s distinction of “dissemination media/success media,” and then compare and contrast their media theories to establish a new interpretation of Kittler: as not a follower of Michel Foucault or Marshall McLuhan, but rather as establishing a new path by emphasizing functionality in information circulation. This interpretation links Kittler with Luhmann. In the conclusion, I provide three theoretical reflections to encourage future interdisciplinary enrichment between media theory and social theory, by cross-referencing Kittler’s “technical media” and Luhmann’s “success media.”",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/fWZMC5dGxqB,7.2,2017,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

However, students are more attracted to professional knowledge and practical training. Therefore, mass communications departments face a challenge in designing courses that meet the expectations of both sides and minimize the gap between theory and practicality.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/VBsXh91RjTg,8.1,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
The Impact of the Digital Camera Revolution on the Transformation of the Film Industry,Huang Wen-lung,"film aesthetics, digital photography, film production system, projection system","Since the birth of the first film cameras in the 19th century, these devices have become a favorite of filmmakers.1 However, more recently the development of digital cameras has affected work patterns within film production systems, so this study aimed to explore the innovations that digital cameras bring to film aesthetics, filmmakers, and the organizational and operational impact of the post-production industry, technology and human resources. This research took the form of in-depth interviews, document analysis, and a diameter discussion. The research found that besides creating opportunities for the film industry, digital cameras have also brought numerous problems that need to be overcome. For example high-definition cameras led to agencies pursuing competitive advantage solely in the form of new equipment and talented persons, while neglecting education and training. Although digital cameras bring enormous convenience, it was found that directors, photographers, artistic, lighting, post-production and other technical staff are becoming over-reliant on this technology, and hence lazier in overcoming shortcomings in or on the scene studios. The findings of this study provide a reference for relevant units.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/SGnePvUODzg,8.1,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
From Prosthetic God to Machinic Enslavement: A Materialist Approach to Media,Huang Guan-hua,"prosthetic God, mediation, becoming-media, machinic enslavement","This article begins by examining the image of a prosthetic God first introduced by Freud, this being the human-centric cultural fantasy most appropriate to the new media era. By exploring numerous conceptual shifts alongside tools, media and machines, the essay stresses the importance of mediation in the relationships between human beings and media technologies. I first draw on the materialist approach of McLuhan to review the thesis of extension and the agency of media. The notion of ＂becoming-media＂ is then set out and used to develop the kind of ontological media analysis that emphasizes the co-constitution of media, human beings and their world. Finally, in the age of socalled digital enclosure, I discuss both the psychoanalytical implications of a prosthetic God and the cybernetic concept of machinic enslavement, to reveal how the human-centric relationship between humans and technologies is reversed.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/IusMnYUEdPT,8.1,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Investigating Public Shares on Facebook: A Case Study Involving Posts on the Fan Page “Lazy.News” during the 318 Students’ Movement,Liu Hui-wen,"user-generated content, Facebook, publicly share, information visualization","The study of information flow on platforms characterized by user-generated information is more likely to adopt the ego-centrism model because of the emphasis on users' characters. However, communication activities on social media are related to factors such as platform design, user patterns, and communication culture. Communication activities cannot always be explained by user self-reporting. Accordingly, this study argues that a data-centered explanatory model could be an alternative explanation about how users interact with the unique design of social media platforms and lead to theoretical concepts that are differentiated from those of the mass media era. Through collecting and visualizing ＂publicly shared＂ information, this research finds that the information communication model on Facebook can be portrayed by two indicators: communication depth and width. After detouring from self-report and personal character study, we think that researchers should focus more on the cooperative characters of sharing activities on social media to develop the communication theory of social media.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/KAYTQXBGFja,8.1,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
The Governance and Supervision of Fake News,Ho Jason C. S.,"fake news, governance, supervision","This article discusses the issue of managing ＂fake news＂ from the perspective of public policy on the media. For audiences, no clear boundary exists between fake news and real news, with the difference merely being one of degree. The purpose of such dissemination of misinformation is to mislead the public while realizing political or commercial benefits. Approaches to the management of fake news can be roughly divided into two types, adopted by the United States and the European Union, respectively. The former adopts a passive stance, handing over to the industry for self-regulation, whereas the latter advocates that social media should detect fake news or remove such material when notified, with failure to do this being penalized under law. In Taiwan’s practice of Internet governance, given how highly Taiwan values and respects press freedom, it is believed that a democratic government in a free country should never be involved in the verification of news information. Instead, it is recommended that industry establish fact-checking systems. Lastly, suppression of fake news cannot focus merely on verification of news by third parties. Rather the solution should involve enhancement of ＂press self-discipline,＂ ＂media licensing,＂ and ＂media literacy education.＂",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/ynvRxXCuQHW,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
When False Claims Take Root Do Corrections Matter? A Preliminary Study on Third-Party Fact-Checking Mechanisms,Hu Yuan-hui,"backfire effect, fact-checking, fake news, misinformation, social media","In response to the issue of fake news having recently received wide attention and stimulated intense global concern, several leading online and social media platforms have partnered with third-party fact-checking organizations to flag news content and evaluate its accuracy. However, increasing controversy exists regarding the impact and efficacy of fact-checking and the existence of an associated backfire effect. This study systematically examines the research on information correction and the backfire effect, identifies the possible impacts of fact-checking, and discusses the current practice of third-party fact-checking mechanisms in the U.S. Through analysis of secondary data and textual analysis, this study concludes that the current operating principles of fact-checking and the presentation of the results of such fact-checking in the U.S. correspond partly to the research findings regarding the backfire effect. More research is needed to further evaluate the practice and strategies of fact-checking to enhance the positive impact of information correction.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/2N9WoAprXRb,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Sentiment Analysis of Political Word-of-Mouth on the Internet: The View of Semantic Orientation,"Chao Yu-chuan, Tao Chen-chao","sentiment analysis, pointwise mutual information, semantic association, semantic orientation, valence","Political word-of-mouth burgeons on the internet. Whether its content is reflecting public opinion, or actually attempting to influence public opinion, is still unknown. This study use the lexicon-based sentiment analysis to examine political word-of-mouth of the two candidates of Taipei Mayor in 2014, Sheng-Wen Lian and Wen-Zhe Ke. We first computed pointwise mutual information (PMI, the ratio of joint probability of the co-occurrence of two words to the chance of the co-occurrence of the same words) to estimate the semantic association between candidate names and emotional words. Then semantic orientation, which is the difference between the PMI of an emotional word to the two candidate names, was obtained to classify emotions as either in the Lian group or the Ke group. Finally, an online survey was used to assess whether the pattern appearing in political word-of-mouth matches the cognitive association in people’s mind. The results show that semantic orientation in political word-of-moth and cognitive association in people’s mind are inconsistent. The partisanship and the valence of emotional words moderate the aforementioned relationship. It is concluded that political word-of-mouth on the internet is in fact persuasive text, not opinion.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/C37VqsbjYcu,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Strategies for Upgrading and Transforming the Variety Show Industry From the Perspective of the Value Chain of TV Format Adaptation: A Case Study of The Voice of China,Tsai Pei,"The Voice of China, glocalization, TV format, variety show, value chain","The import and export of TV program formats is important in media globalization. Focusing only on the globalization of TV content risks ignoring the development and potential of TV format globalization. From the perspective of cultural globalization, this study examined the value chain of TV format adaptation, including strategies of purchasing outstanding foreign formats, learning new production techniques, developing localized creativity, and producing high quality local programs. This study provides a possible direction for academic research on the TV program format adaptation value chain as well as practical suggestions for upgrading and transforming Taiwan’s variety show industry. Based on in-depth interviews and secondary data analysis, this case study on The Voice of China identifies the following strategies for media in Taiwan: Research and development departments should be established to cultivate ＂a nose for television formats.＂ Production companies should generate more revenue through sharing the investment in broadcasting. Rather than cutting costs, additional sources of revenue should be cultivated. Besides content localization, the major contribution of program format localization comes from integrating local resources and developing a local industry value chain. The results of this study suggest that variety shows in Taiwan should prioritize cultivation of the program brand, as well as the development of program formats to create a value-added media industry.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/vc9FXQnB6US,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Identity Practices of Mainland Spouses in Taiwan: Some Practical Perspectives,Chen Hong,"social structure, identity, cross-strait marriage, practical paradigm","The study aimed to address the three following problems: 1) the restrictions encountered by mainland Chinese brides in Taiwan with different social capital, 2) the identity practices such brides enacted in their daily lives, 3) the interactions of such brides with structures in complex social contexts. Drawing on illustrative examples from in-depth interviews and participant observation of 17 mainland spouses, the findings revealed that family-of-origin, duration of residence in Taiwan, educational level, and the social status of their Taiwanese spouse, all influenced the practical decisions of such brides. While playing the roles of citizen, woman and foreigner, the respondents showed varied forms of practicing their identity, including ＂struggling against structures,＂ ＂being unaware of structures,＂ and ＂being constrained by structures while simultaneously enabling those structures.＂",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/MxsGYqQ74hl,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Transformational Justice in Taiwanese Radio Broadcasting—A Case Study of the BCC,Chiu Eve,"NCC, BCC, Taiwan Broadcasting Association, transformational justice, party property","The Broadcasting Cooperation of China (BCC), a subsidiary organization of the ruling party, the Kuo Min Tang (KMT), for several decades dominated radio broadcasting in Taiwan. During Taiwan’s martial law period the BCC worked together with three wireless TV stations (TTV, CTV and CTS) to reproduce loyalty to the KMT and Chinese patriotism while simultaneously carrying out a mission of ＂blocking enemy radio waves.＂ This thesis traces how the BCC received extensive land assets originally belonging to the ＂Taiwan Broadcasting Association＂ when these assets were transferred from the Japanese colonial government in 1945. Additionally, this paper presents how the BCC obtained control of numerous radio frequencies and gradually built a broadcasting network covering the whole of Taiwan. This thesis also details how the relevant government departments dealt with the BCC issue following Taiwan’s first democratic transfer of power in 2000. Particularly, the role of the NCC is highlighted, this being the organization responsible for radio frequency distribution and the issue of broadcasting licenses. The historical facts of the BCC having occupied public assets are crystal clear, and certain BCC assets were obtained as ＂improper property＂ of the KMT. With the successful passage into law of ＂The Regulation on the Disposal of Property Improperly Obtained via the Party and its Affiliated Organizations,＂ Taiwanese society is about to embark on its ＂transformational justice＂ project. A full understanding of the detailed circumstances surrounding this issue will help identify an optimal direction for society in reaching a resolution and will improve future prospects for dealing with issues related to the BCC.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/QUhzb7fuCki,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
"Turning Back the Sequence of Time, Returning to Visuality: Exploring the Classical Strand of Visual Rhetoric and its Demonstration",Wang Hsiao-yung,"Bakhtin, classical rhetoric, technical strand, style/elocutio, visual rhetoric","This essay aims to explore and delimit the classical strand of visual rhetoric and its demonstration. First, it attempts to clarify that ＂visuality has always been integral to rhetorical consciousness.＂ This is done by critically reviewing the rhetorical theories and related literatures of the Roman rhetoricians Cicero and Quintilian. This review demonstrates that the so-called ＂five canons of rhetoric,＂ originally derived from verbal and spoken rhetorical tradition, effectively bridge the gap between the philosophical and sophistic strands by reviving the principle of the imitation of the technical strand. To enhance the recognition of visual rhetoric as action-oriented, the author refers to the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin, and specifically his study on novelistic time in stylistics of grammar. This approach can address the specific timeline deployed by rhetors to refuse the absolute past, focus on unfinalized contemporary reality, and look forward to an open future. In conclusion, the author mentions that the dynamics and rhetorical efficacy embodied by visual rhetoric involve encouraging dialogue, inducing identification and breaking abeyance. These might be the lasting and irreplaceable problematization and specificity that exist in visual rhetoric not only in contemporary reality but also in ancient times.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/WdjFIxLy2lq,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

First, we discuss the aspects of a medium, and consider a medium as being 1 an extension of humanity, and 2 functional in the action of signs or semiosis. Second, we examine the case of a video gaming system, and suggest that 1 a video gaming system is a simulation medium that brings virtual reality to life by technical pattern interaction, and 2 people should not only interact with such a system, but should use it to play. Third, we explore the medium type of a motion-controlled gaming system, which we believe is a type of iconic medium that mediates the paradoxical semiotics. Finally, we develop a taxonomic model for mediums and examine the interpretability of that model using a case study of Wii Sports.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/JNHg5Oc87fZ,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
From Media Access to ICT Access: Communicational Practices of Senior Volunteers in Remote Areas in Taiwan,Lo Yen-chieh,"older people, communication rights, media access, ageism, social capital","The importance of access to the mass media and ICT cannot be overstated. However, the communication rights of older people living in remote areas have often been ignored, despite their importance in an aged society. Previous studies have rarely analyzed media access from the perspectives of seniors. The issue of ICT access has been interpreted at best from the perspective of the digital divide, despite the importance of the perspectives of older people. Using qualitative in-depth interviews and focus groups, this study investigates older volunteers in Hualien, analyzing the impediments and opportunities they face in relation to access. The author finds that participants highlighted the two aspects of ageism and incomplete family communication, and moreover that social capital is central in empowering older people and providing them access opportunities. The author suggests that if the government aims to facilitate access to communication technologies for older adults, this goal could be realized faster by eradicating ageism in media content and strengthening the social capital of seniors.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/273HmBAz8bc,8.2,2018,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Challenging Air Pollution: An Explorative Study of Community Action Science and Localized Practices,"Tu Wen-ling, Shih Chia-liang","citizen science, air monitoring, knowledge generation, air governance","In recent years, the air pollution issues have become one of the top concerns for the Taiwanese society. Unsatisfied with the deteriorating air qualities, the local citizen groups have asked the government to disclose the real-time air monitoring data. Some communities in the central and southern Taiwan have launched community action initiative, raising air quality flags in elementary schools, partnering with the experts to develop low-cost air monitoring devices. This paper explores how grass-root groups have participated in knowledge generation by collecting air pollution evidences, integrating their observations and experiences into the scientific practices of air monitoring. The nascent air pollution surveillance efforts explicate how the community groups have produced, interpreted, and applied air monitoring data to challenge the government's regulatory policies. Additionally, the paper discusses the potentials and limitations of the current community air monitoring programs in Taiwan and the required social infrastructure affording technoscience democracy and environmental justice.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/HfBCPYNwcel,9.1,2019,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

The study focused on the process of teaching junior students to explore local community, and to make a documentary about social participation. Students made use of the features of tablets (iPads for example) such as portability, video filming, concept mapping and frieze applications. A documentary were created which concerned about social participation, practice, and creativity. A design research method was used that intended to transfer classrooms from academic work factors to actual learning environments. The methodology encouraged reflective thinking practice among students, teachers, and researchers. The study result designed three teaching steps that could be used separately or assembly to be a whole process.

On the Rhetorical Ecologies of Internet Discourse: Discussion of Sexual Orientation in the Military in Network Communities,"Tsao Kai-ming, Liu Ta-hau","digital rhetoric, rhetorical ecologies, text mining, misidentification, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)","The theory of rhetorical ecology argues that the perceived meanings of circulating texts are in constant flux as they transform and condition the audience. Moreover, the nature of the symbolic action is such that it can be used as a tool for viral spread. The concept of rhetorical situation can thus be replaced with ＂rhetorical ecologies.＂ In this research, the author performs text mining and empirical analysis of the online discourse about homosexuality in the military. The derived terms used by the online discursive public are found to continue to evolve under the influence of existing arguments and connotations, justifying discrimination and deepening polarization. The ecology of the terms used in the online discussion on specific issues appears to be changing and spreading, but the meanings remain in an impasse due to the existing misidentification and the absence of Kairos that facilitate the formation of fitting responses. Hence, with regard to the application of rhetorical ecologies in an online setting, optimism about the co-creation of terms and meanings by the discursive public is insufficient. Instead, a critical look at the ecology of the rhetoric related to certain issues is needed for possible conditioned interpretation and limitation of perception.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/H1NfBPhbtpK,9.1,2019,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Substitution and Time Displacement Effects of Free Newspapers on Paid Newspapers in Hong Kong: A Longitudinal Study,"So Clement Y.

Based on five telephone surveys conducted in 2005, 2008, 2010, 2013 and 2016, it was found that between 2005 and 2016, the readership of free newspapers in Hong Kong increased steadily at the expense of that of paid newspapers. The study results showed that in 2016 respondents spent more days per week and more time per day reading free newspapers relative to paid newspapers, representing a reversal from a decade earlier, when respondents spent more time reading paid newspapers than free ones. The results of the analyses also showed that free newspaper exposure was a significant predictor of both the frequency of buying paid newspapers and of time spent reading paid newspapers. These findings indicate that higher exposure to free newspapers leads to greater substitution and time displacement effects of free newspapers on paid newspapers.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/nZ8j4vIxbOk,9.1,2019,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

I Want to Talk: The May Fourth Movement and China’s Age of Speech Communication,Yu Tzu-hsiang,"May Fourth Movement, public speaking, debate, baihua, Cheng She-Wo","The so called May Fourth Movement refers narrowly to a youth political movement and broadly to an ideological and cultural movement. This thesis applies concepts from Cheng She-Wo's ＂I want to talk＂ to decode the significance of May Fourth in Chinese history. The author first documents Cheng's personal connections with May Fourth, then describes how ＂I want to talk＂ best depicts the changes occurring in culture and communications ecology at the time. Changes evolved into an Age of Speech Communication. This age occurred through the introductions of three forms of communication: public speaking, debate, and baihua (writing in vernacular, modern style). Through these concrete practices of the concept embodied in ＂I want to talk,＂ the author argues that the primary May Fourth goals, namely strengthening China by promoting ＂Mr. Democracy＂ and ＂Mr. Science,＂ were realized by the coming of ＂Mr. Communication.＂ This development of Chinese communication ecology changed China for a century.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/koxCE8Ky0UL,9.2,2019,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
The Convergence of the Forces of Technology and Politics and the Rise of the May Fourth Protest Movement,Jiang Pei,"May Fourth Protest Movement, media and transportation technology, Anfu Clique, Research Clique, warlord politics","In late Qing dynasty and early Republic of China, the introduction of telegraph and printing machine into China and the gradual networking of railroads and other means of transportation drove the emergence of the press industry, and postal service played a crucial role in information communication, hereby laying an indispensable technological foundation for the rise of May Fourth Protest Movement and forcibly promoting the spread of nationalist thoughts in modern China. Without the common psychological cognition formed on the basis of the thoughts of modern nationalism, the development of a nationwide wave of protest was unimaginable, even with the communication of the information on the failure of diplomatic efforts at Paris Peace Conference. During the May Fourth Protest Movement, the Research Clique, Anfu Clique and other political factions added fuel to the flames, while Wu Peifu of Zhili Clique and southwest power took advantage of the students' movement to undermine the image of Beijing government. The involvement of worker and merchant groups in the protest movement was on the one hand spurred by nationalist sentiments, and on the other, pressured by the student group and consideration of their own interests.

Hu Shi's vernacular movement influenced the ways of thinking and writing of all Chinese people, and although the liberalism he advocated came to fruition only after the end of Taiwan's martial law era, it was influential from much earlier times. The magazine Free China, founded in 1949, typifies the ways in which Hu Shi's ideas gained currency. In 1960, Lei Zhen, one of the founders of the magazine, was arrested along with others. Hu Shi responded by urging the American magazine magnate, Henry Luce, to come to their rescue, challenging previous stereotypes around Hu Shi being inactive in such cases. Cheng She-Wo actively used relationships to calm tensions, signed a joint request for a presidential pardon, and often visited the prisoners, all of which represented practical actions.

A content analysis was conducted focused on coverage of this incident by the major national news agencies of the two involved countries, namely Central News Agency (CNA) and Philippines News Agency (PNA), as well as in-depth interviews of the two sides. Findings suggest Taiwan's CNA covered the incident more intensively than the Philippine's PNA, with eight times as many reports, and furthermore that PNA tended to be more rational and objective than its Taiwanese counterpart. As for the media's framing of the incident, both sides mostly employed emotional appeals in their respective news text despite most of the actual news content related to the incident being legal in nature. Due to Taiwan assuming the role of victim in the incident, in addition to pressure from Taiwanese public opinion, CNA had more news domestication than PNA, which catered to a readership from a country seen as the injurer in the dispute. Nationalist sentiments in CNA were also aroused when PNA tried to deal with the incident under the so-called ＂One China Policy,＂ a policy Taiwan has opposed for many years. Ultimately, coverage by the two news agencies eventually evolved toward a basically neutral stance, with clashes related to news coverage being minimized together with a tendency to produce positive reports to maintain the image and interests of their respective home countries.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/k4edmWDPzbt,9.2,2019,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

We contextualize dietary culture according to three aspects: production, circulation, and access. Furthermore, we examine the agency of a group of highly educated chefs who have received their training in France. The main methodology of the study consists of participant observation and in-depth interviews. This study analyzes the motivations of the chefs and their process of accumulating bodily knowledge, culinary techniques, and cultural capital during their transnational movement. Facing competition from transnational pastry brands, many of the pastry chefs involved in the study have decided to build their own brands upon returning to Taiwan. These chefs have used their pastry shops as spaces to perform their unique interpretation of the taste and style of French pastries and maintain direct communication with their customers. In their shops and in the media, the chefs actively create a discourse on authenticity and cultural meanings associated with French pastries. As digital natives, many of the chefs have built their professional networks through social media and appealed to a niche consumer market that identifies with taste and value.

Taking recent food safety issues in Taiwan as an example, this study aims to explore interpretations of risk uncertainty and the need for risk communication among experts and lay people. Two focus group sessions were conducted to create an interactive setting wherein different stakeholders could pursue dialogue and reach consensus. The goal of focus group interviews is to construct risk communication strategies that embody civic participation, and to provide important references for government that can be used in future risk governance and communication. The study asserts that mechanisms of civic participation are essential for achieving consensus in risk communication related to food safety. Additionally, this study suggests that both government and experts must admit the limitations of scientific knowledge regarding food safety, and provide lay people with information needed to evaluate risk uncertainty. This approach will enable the formation of an alliance of different stakeholders to develop a consensus based on social value and trust.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/zCIAw90DGrF,10.1,2020,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Science Communication: Knowledge Dissemination or Public Engagement?,Hans Peter Peters,"science communication, trust in science, public engagement, knowledge dissemination, science in society","This essay discusses models of science communication. It concludes that while public trust in science and the relationship between science and society are important, the core function of science is creation and provision of knowledge and hence this should be prioritized in the public communication of science. The turn from ＂public understanding of science＂ to ＂public engagement with science and technology＂ as an attempt to address the crisis of trust has shifted attention from communication of knowledge towards communication aiming at improving the relation of science and society. In practice, the implementation of the public engagement paradigm often trivialized its original democratic pretensions. Creating enjoyable experiences for members of the public seems to be the primary goal, while the business of science is shielded from substantial public participation and public engagement ＂playgrounds＂ are created instead. With respect to communication related to knowledge, I acknowledge the potential of co-construction of knowledge through discourses that include both scientists and non-scientists but still argue that plain dissemination of knowledge remains an important function of science communication. To avoid the pitfalls of the so-called deficit model I propose ＂non-paternalistic knowledge communication＂ as a model suited to democratic societies. Empirical data about trust in science and scientists' attitudes towards public participation in Taiwan, the United States and Germany illustrates some of the issues regarding trust and participation.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/QcCL68zeRw3,10.1,2020,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

This research also investigates the moderating effects of tie strength. The results show that Facebook check-in affects malicious envy, which leads to negative brand associations. This research also identifies moderating effects of tie strength on a brand. When tie strength is strong, conspicuous check-in does not affect brand equity. When it is weak, check-in leads to positive brand associations via brand quality.

Results of a random sample survey found that respondents perceived others to be more influenced than themselves by election coverage. Moreover, this study shows that both news attention and news elaboration significantly predicted the perceived effects of news on both the self and others.

The first strategy, called the ＂deficit model,＂ aims to resolve disputes by educating the public and filling the knowledge gaps that exist between laypeople and experts. The second strategy, called the ＂deliberation model,＂ recruits stakeholders to discuss specific issues, thus allowing socially-valued collective opinions to be brought into conversations and so influence policy making. However, there is a third model that bridges experts and media to enforce the quality of science news broadcasting. This model was developed by the Science Media Centre (SMC) in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2002. The implementation of this model has successfully confronted long-standing scientific disputes in the UK, with the result that the model was gradually adopted in four other countries around the world. The motto of the UK SMC is ＂The media will DO science better when scientists DO the media better,＂ and the approach encapsulated in this slogan has become an important paradigm that keeps empowering experts and journalists in the communication of science. Inspired by UK SMC, Science Media Center Taiwan was established in 2017, and joined the international SMCs in 2019. After two years of operation, the center implements practices to identify strengths and challenges, and provides valuable insights by routinely identifying communication difficulties between experts and journalists.

This study used the power and subjectivity analysis of Michel Foucault and the hidden transcript analysis of James C. Scott as a theoretical frame, and employed the ＂in-depth interview＂ and ＂document analysis＂ as research methods. The results indicated that the main reason for disappearance of texts or suspension of ID was commentary on sensitive issues during sensitive times. Texts deemed ＂sensitive＂ were typically hidden from viewers and substituted with a message from website administrators reading ＂Http 404 or Not Found.＂ The definition of ＂sensitive keywords＂ is dynamic and lacks any standard. This study also found that netizens used different kinds of resistance strategies, including the ＂delayed release strategy,＂ ＂reporting the facts,＂ ＂metaphorical writings,＂ ＂substituting sensitive words,＂ ＂video,＂ ＂changing digital code,＂ ＂multi-platform,＂ and ＂reincarnation＂ to access fissures affording opportunities for survival.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/cIfmjGwTJs2,10.2,2020,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Hong Kong’s Gaze and Taiwanese Aborigines: Representations of Aborigines in 1960s Hong Kong Cinema,Ni Yen-yuan,"Hong Kong cinema, Taiwanese aborigines, gaze","This study mainly targets two movies involving Taiwanese aborigines that were released in the mid-1960s in Hong Kong, namely, ＂Black Forest＂ released in 1964 and ＂Song of Orchid Island＂ released in 1965. Both these movies explore and reinterpret the image of aborigines. The two movies specifically present the exotic imagination of Hong Kong filmmakers in relation to Taiwanese aborigines and associated image construction. Previous research on representation of Taiwanese aborigines has overlooked the importance of these two movies. This study attempts to bring together the pieces of the puzzle, highlighting Hong Kong's perspectives, and embedding the movie texts in Hong Kong's geopolitics and the context of its film industry. This study found that both movies purposely play down representations of the Taiwanese state, amplify song and dance performances as a type of visual spectacle, and duplicate the special mode of Han Chinese men falling in love with indigenous women.

It was found that news stories focused more on criticisms than on the issue itself. Regardless of subject matter, little was based on evidence and facts. The news discourse was also framed economically, focusing either on development and efficiency or on fairness and distributional justice. Little news discourse was framed environmentally. Economy-related sources were also used frequently. Generally, the news stories meet the criteria examining the mechanisms that could contribute to public understanding of the scientific aspect of the Electricity Act. The study did not find mainstream media systematically different from alternative media in terms of civic engagement elements, but the former revealed more varied perspectives than the latter. Some mainstream media were also found to demonstrate higher levels of positive elements that could increase public engagement in the revision process of the Electricity Act than specific alternative media.

Through the discourse-historical approach of critical discourse analysis, this research examines self-reference, calls for identity, the construction of the other, frame contests, and manipulation of ideologies from relevant texts. It finds that the core discourse revolves around ＂the absolute leadership of the Party,＂ ＂the great rejuvenation of the nation,＂ and ＂the struggle to rebuild the order.＂ The main target audience of Xi's discourse is the Party, with the Chinese people and Taiwan being ＂disappeared.＂ In Xi’s discourse, the most obvious ＂other＂ is the U.S. Xi Jinping has used patriotism, nationalism, people-centered ideology and globalization discourse to shape anti-American sentiment. In his strategy for Hong Kong and Taiwan, Xi has proposed a framework of ＂unity＂ and ＂peace＂ to fight against the 'democratic system.＂ Xi Jinping manipulates spurious relationships and the other three argumentation strategies to distort history and consolidate his regime.

Theories and Practices of Public Relations Ethics on Social Media,Cheng I-Huei,"internet-related public relations, social media, PR ethics, ethics management","Ethics is an important topic in the field of public relations as it encompasses value both for theoretical development and practical implications. With the advent of social media, the relevant ethical issues are in need for more exploration. Today's public relations work may involve management of social media platforms and online buzz, showing that new media has brought forth changes in the industry. Meanwhile, some controversial practices, however, also urge us to pay even more attention to the issue of ethics. Past literature on public relations ethics have been rather limited to philosophical discussions and case analyses. Thus, the current study was aimed to understand the views of public relations practitioners with a survey. The findings indicated that the issues of privacy, confidentiality, and truthfulness, as well as legal regulations were considered as the most critical. About half of the respondents reported their organizations have codes of PR ethics, and about one-third, guidelines for new media. The data also show reserved attitude toward whether codes of ethics may be useful for making decisions under various circumstances.

Their scholarly works adopt archaeological approaches that rejected linear narratives to understand the study of media, they instead emphasized more on the material underpinning of media as well as related the media study to the conditions of media culture. This article is divided into four parts. First, the paper introduces to how to think of media archaeology as discursive travelling that emerges from the field of media as well as sets out to illuminate its core idea resonating with the various theoretical positions as well, e.g., media forensics, infrastructure studies, and platform studies. Second, the article examines each chapter in this edited volume and further illuminates its argumentation concretely. Third, in the light of this materialistic epistemology, the paper thus extends into discussions regarding how the media archaeology excavated the ＂historical media＂ with the concept of cultural technique. Finally, this article suggests that media archaeology should take the notions of ＂media as networks＂ as well as ＂networks as media＂ into consideration for understanding media more archaeologically in contemporary society and culture.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/bJCQm48HlFt,11.1,2021,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Questions explored in this study include the key factors that shaped the journalism education at NCCU, the concepts of journalism education in different periods, the curriculum features, the academic approaches, and how and why each change of direction happened. The findings indicated that American journalism education had a profound impact on the development axis of the journalism education at NCCU as well as the overall development of journalism education in Taiwan. Despite being under the strong influence of the logic of the party-state capital on its concepts of education and research efforts, the Department of Journalism at NCCU strived to pursue and maintain its subjectivity in education.

Despite the relatively late establishment of the department of communication at RUC as an independent institution, two professors in the journalism department, Zhang Longdong and Lin Shan, had started introducing Western communication theories to China since the 1960s. For more than 60 years, the School (Department) of Journalism and Communication at RUC has always been at the forefront of communication research and education in China. After reviewing the history of the development of communication research in the School of Journalism and Communication at RUC, this study found that, as an academic discipline from the West, communication studies underwent a long process of disciplinization and localization in China. Its development was influenced less by its academic logic but more by external and accidental factors such as the process of disciplinization or the political and economic forces. The communication discipline was swaying between being critical and being receptive as well as between politics and markets. As such, the theoretical creativity in the discipline remains to be improved.

This study conducted three rounds of group interviews along with surveys in 2014, 2016, and 2018 respectively to investigate the changes of the Internet uses of these students before and after coming to Taiwan and their motivations of the changes. The findings indicated that, during their stay in Taiwan, the access of popular foreign and Taiwanese websites blocked in China had increased significantly, while the access of similar websites in mainland China had decreased significantly. The changes were consistent among the three rounds of data collection. The main reasons for these changes are the practical needs for social contact, entertainment, the convenience of everyday life, etc., which correspond with the uses and gratifications theory. Another reason for such changes is the curiosity over politically sensitive issues. However, most mainland Chinese students in group interviews expressed their negative attitudes towards the free communication environment in Taiwan. Possibly due to the deteriorating cross-strait relations in recent years, those students who come to study in Taiwan later have become more cautious in their interview responses, and they have expressed more negative attitudes towards their experiences of the Internet uses in Taiwan.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/US5CYg4hpy0,11.2,2021,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

Content analysis and textual analysis were conducted to analyze postings on the Facebook fan pages of four groups that support same-sex marriage, followed by in-depth interviews with 10 activists from these groups. The findings demonstrate that “diagnostic frames” were the most commonly used frames, followed by “motivational framings” and “blaming frames” The comments against same-sex marriage argued that the traditional marriage supports public interest, the function of the family, and proper parenting, whereas the postings that support same-sex marriage emphasized the importance of human rights, marriage equality, and progressive social values. In terms of mobilization, social media eliminated geographical boundaries and expanded the size of alliance networks that through the development of interpersonal links. Endorsements from social media influencers also attracted more supporters to identify with the cause of the activists. This exemplifies the unique dynamics of “social media coalition politics.” Since the social media functions as private communities as well as public platforms, it provides a field of interdiscursivity for intimate relationships to flow across the boundaries between the private and the public.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/TjvxdaSR0c1,12.1,2022,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Daily News Verification as Organizational Work: A Study of Taiwan’s Four Major Newspapers,CHIANG Chin-Chih,"daily news, collaborative verification, news verification, news organization, routine","This study conducted in-depth interviews with 30 journalists, who work for Taiwan’s four major newspapers, to analyze the practice of daily news verification at an organizational level. The study found that news verification norms as a routine emerge during the news production process and in organizational interactions. Except for important and influential news stories, the responsibility for news verification is always regarded as the job of individual journalists rather than that of the organization. Further, the news organization’s policy requirements of news verification depend upon the number of gatekeepers, sub-editors' domain and contextual knowledge, and the interaction between sub-editors and journalists. Based on the above, the news organizations have higher standards of news verification for print news than for online real-time news. Certain flaws in online real-time news stories, which can be short and continuously updated, are often tolerable since they have to be fast and be the first in a competitive market. Finally, the study emphasizes that news verification can be more efficiently accomplished by coordinating journalists of different specialties, interviewing each of the interested parties in different fields, and collaboratively cross-checking information for corroboration when covering the continuing news. This process may even uncover more evidence that may change the original news coverage and improve the overall news quality.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/XMS1lu3jLWh,12.1,2022,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Populist Leader’s Online Communication During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study on Philippine President Duterte’s Facebook,CHANG Chun-Yen,"populism, Duterte, social media, the Philippines, the COVID-19 pandemic","This article aims to explore how populist national leaders use social media to communicate with people during the COVID-19 pandemic. By examining Philippine President Duterte’s use of social media, the researcher identified four populist communication styles in his pandemic prevention and control messages: (1) The way to “appeal to the people” has changed, (2) The anti-elite and antiestablishment messages have disappeared, (3) COVID-19 is defined as the only common enemy to people, (4) A hope is constructed for people that the solution to the pandemic has to rely on the aid of Chinese vaccines. Findings of the research indicate that Duterte’s online populist messages were full of self-praising of his own pandemic control policy, his plans, and his officials. However, since Duterte’s messages were still expressed in the styles that violated the values of democracy, it is afraid that a kind of populist authoritarianism was formed in the name of pandemic prevention and control.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/wWUN8SHvKfQ,12.1,2022,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
"Kulturtechnik, Media Archaeology, and Cybernetics: On Recent Developments of German Media Studies",XU Mei-Mei,"cultural techniques, cybernetics, Kittler, media archaeology, German media theory","For the past few years, German media theory has achieved a broad attention inside Chinese academic circles. Works by Kittler, Zielinski, Elsaesser, and more recent ones such as Pias, Ernst, Bernhard, Krämer, Vismann, etc., have been translated into Chinese. Concepts such as media archaeology, media technology, and cultural techniques have also been explicated. However, due to sporadic translations and lack of research, these works often appear to be confusing and difficult to understand. Based on comparative and historical methods, this article investigates “German media theory” from the perspective of the history of German media theories and its generational changes. This article focuses on three representative Kittlerian media theories, i.e. Kulturtechnik, radical media archaeology, and cybernetics, especially on their most recent influences, in order to analyze and discuss the rebellious, apostate, and recursive trends under which German media theories have developed since 1980s.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/Ng0Zpi9Tmz7,12.1,2022,Journal of Communication Research and Practice
Constructing a Cultural Nomadism of Perception Privatization: An Analysis of TAO Ya-Lun’s Creation of Virtual Reality Art Series,"HSU Tuan-Yi, CHIU Chih-Yung","cultural nomadism, TAO Ya-Lun, virtual reality, virtual art, perception privatization","Since in the latter half of the twentieth century, the development of computer-centric hardware devices and software technologies has shaped the culture of contemporary digital media and has had significant impacts on our daily lives. Among all the digital technologies, virtual reality has evolved in a variety of ways, not only in the area of commercial applications, but also in that of contemporary techno-art creation. This paper attempts to analyze the cultural phenomenon and meaning of series works of virtual reality art created by Taiwanese contemporary techno-artist TAO Ya-Lun and discuss how the aesthetics and practice of virtual art can construct a cultural nomadism of perception privatization in the process of audience participation. Unlike the traditional narrative image art, TAO Ya-Lun's works of art return in a unique way to explore the essence of virtual reality art in terms of “imitating image,” “participatory embodiment,” and “(syn)aesthetic perception.” This has become the unique context and style of his works.",https://jcrp.ciaoyu.com.tw/archives/article/WoZH83S25MQ,12.1,2022,Journal of Communication Research and Practice

No More No Less, the subject of the case study, is the result of a project carried out by two artists. Thomas Sauvin collected ready-made portrait albums for Kensuke Koike to deconstruct and reconstruct the images. They provided identical materials to three publishers in France, Italy, and China, respectively, and commissioned them to produce limited copies of photobooks by the same deadline. This paper employs the theory of “remediation” as well as the concepts of “immediacy” and “hypermediacy” to analyze the case of No More No Less.

Four chapters are devoted to depict features of important platform industries: (1) the dynamic changing of the news industry, (2) the current condition of urban transport, (3) healthcare and health research, and (4) the “platformization” of education and related concerns. The discussions connect tightly with public values and the needs of the civil society. This review argues that the authors are successful in proposing the responsible design of global platform societies and raising awareness of public values practice and the corporate governance of high-quality platform societies.

This paper first examines various types of ethical problems in the news media through the observation of their manifestations and underlying causes and then conducts moral reasoning of four different types of ethical problems. The paper attempts to modify and expand the theoretical construct of “Journalistic Paradigm,” which has been used to explain media behavior from the perspective of political ideology, by making “serving whose interests” as a new independent variable. It is found that among the six sub-variables, “serving the interests of the government∕political party” and “serving the commercial interests of the media” are the two most influential factors affecting the professional conduct of the news media in Hong Kong.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=999,74,2003,Mass Communication Research

Unlike the traditional positive and more recent linguistic researchers who consider a corresponding relationship between the external reality and realities reflected in news reports, the authors prefer to suggest the importance of how affection and feeling are involved in the reading and watching of news. News therefore is redefined here as “a process of continuous aesthetic dialogue between the information gatekeepers and audience, starting from the former’s objective and professional reporting and writing of narrative stories and ending when the audience receives those stories subjectively and affectively.”",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=998,74,2003,Mass Communication Research

The Ambiguous Representation in Political News: Marketization and Two Chinese Newspapers?Coverage of President Clinton Visiting China,Yanhong Li,"Chinese media, media marketization, political news, news frame, news rhetoric, dehegemonization","This study is a comparative analysis of the coverage of President Bill Clinton掇 China visit in 1998 by the Global Times (GT), a national market-oriented newspaper based in Beijing and by the People掇 Daily (PD), the formal mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, It is first found that the GT marginalized the three basic frames that totally dominated the PD掇 coverage and employed more human interest frames in its coverage, but still no opposite frame was found. The diversion of the frames decreased the functions that political news in party journalism fulfilled. Secondly, the GT employed more rhetoric of balance, of facticity, and of neutrality to achieve a more open representation. The differences between the two papers can be interpreted as on outcome of market, where the PD is almost totally controlled by the party/state, while the performance of GT is a negotiation between market logic and party logic. This study helps in understanding the impact of marketization on the representation of political news, a realm generally thought to be untouched by market considerations: the market force has not given rise to an alternative discourses on the main, but has made some subtle and significant changes by diluting ideological propaganda and mainstream discourse.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1006,75,2003,Mass Communication Research
News Discourse and Taiwan Society: The Agenda History of the 228 Incident,Chun-Hsiang Hsia,"the 228 Incident, life history, news discourse, collective memory, structural amnesia, agenda setting","This essay reconsiders the collective memory and explores the potential role of news discourse in Taiwan掇 society. It focuses on the 228 Incident as a news agenda with a history of its own. Regarded as one of the most influential events in Taiwan history, the incident carries various symbolic meanings in the contemporary society of Taiwan. Drawing upon Michel Foucault, the essay conceptualizes and explores the idea of‘life history’. With relevant texts collected from four major Chinese newspapers, it identifies the structural amnesia in Taiwan history and then examines the historical context that can explain Taiwan media掇 current mental disability. The author concludes that frequent coverage leads one to ponder upon the agenda-setting function of mass media. The media, while serving to inform the audience of this agenda and providing a collective outlet for the long-suppressed emotions, tend to ignore their role as the public sphere. Through the apparent check-and-balance mechanism, they pursue as many voices as possible, yet just for a bare appearance of diversity. In this pursuit, however, they neglect the necessity of functioning more constructively.

It then proceeds to examine leading journals and publications in this field and points out that CPEC has exerted its impact only after 1992 when major media reform activities took place in Taiwan, including mainly the free radio movement and campaigning for public television group etc. Additional issues related to copyright, film industry掇 media workers, and labour processes among other diverse subjects have also received valid analyses from a CPEC perspective. The author concludes by suggesting that four topics be further diagnosed. Namely, they are the factors in the 1960s that determined TV掇 character, second, how should the early intensive competition among the three TV stations in the early 1970s be interpreted, third, an assessment on the significance of efforts in setting up public service television since the 1980s, finally, clashes from globalization and cultural imperialism discourses as applied to TV since the 1990s.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1008,75,2003,Mass Communication Research

Science and Slogan:On the Dissemination of Scientific Ethos,Kwang-kuo Hwang,"Scientific Microworld, Lifeworld, Philosophy of Science, Scientific Research","By comparing two types of knowledge in the scientific microworld and lifeworld, this article indicates that the philosophy of science is indeed the foundation of scientific developments. In Western countries, there is an interdependent relationship between the development of various sciences and the philosophy of science: the development of sciences might provide materials for reflection on the philosophy of science, while the progress of the philosophy of science might inspire further developments of various sciences. Nevertheless, the relationship between these two sectors is often broken down in non-Western countries. Most researchers have only superficial or a literal understanding about western philosophy of science, and their inability to comprehend ethos of Western science may result in the long-term underdevelopment of scientific research. Taking Hu Shih掇 attempts of using a slogan to promote the understanding of scientific methods as an example, this article argues that a slogan might be helpful for the dissemination of scientific ideas, but it might also lead to the distortion of a researcher掇 understanding about the philosophy of science. Therefore, it is necessary to educate our intellectuals of the next generation so as to understand the ethos of the West掇 philosophy of science in order to enable them to use it as implicit knowledge for creative research work in their future academic career.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1020,76,2003,Mass Communication Research

This study conducted 11 focus group interviews with college students heavily using BBS. After analyzing the interview text, the study finds that on-line gender interaction as manifested in the aspects of gender category and identity, gendered communication, and sexual harassment management is based on and thus reproduces and strengthens the hegemonic masculinity of off-line reality. The study also observes that, due to the user掇 self-imposed gap between on-line and off-line realities, the equalizer role of the internet is activated only on the micro level of subjective self.

The results show that users?cognitive images of Internet media include four aspects: (1) Personal control and participation rights, (2) Interpersonal communication tool, (3) Mass media, and (4) Two-way communication. The study finds that the factor“Personal control and participation rights”is the most interpretive of the four aspects, so that users emphasize it the most. Finally, the paper develops a“Network media mixed model”: the network shows a multi-mixed media that assembles three communication models, including mass, interpersonal communication, and personal media. It integrates“personal and mass”,“personal and interpersonal”, and“mass and interpersonal”effects, it also emphasizes on users and users’participation in media activity, and so it forms an“individual-run media”character. As opposed to the mass media reception model, this one shows a kind of creative effect.

Results of content analysis and an audience survey show that the primary media frames were indeed intensive and recent, and that the adoption of primary media frames significantly predicted audience members’ policy stances. This suggests that consistent media frames over time have long-term priming effects on audience members?policy evaluations. Furthermore, the adoption of primary media frames serves as a mediator between exposure to case-related news and policy stances. The more the audience members were exposed to case-related news, the more likely they would be to adopt the primary media frames and support the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant. This implies that the pro-nuclear stance of the primary media frames affected public opinion, and that the news media were conducive to delegitimizing the DPP掇 anti-Fourth Nuclear Power Plant policy.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1026,77,2003,Mass Communication Research
Journalistic Paradigm Shift in China's Media Reforms: Evidence from Media Exemplar Evaluations,Zhongdang Pan and Joseph Man Chan,"Mainland China media reforms, journalistic professionalism, journalistic paradigm, media exemplar","This paper reports findings from the 2002 surveys of China掇 journalists and journalism students. It shows that, under the influences of media reforms and media globalization, two journalistic paradigms, “party journalism”and“professional journalism,”now co-exist among China's journalists. While the former is associated with praises for the Party organs, the latter has complements for the western media, while the former is rooted in emphasizing the media's policy explanations and popular advocacy roles, the latter is built upon the idea of the media as a disseminator, while the former is related to its emphasis on training in party propaganda policies and the official journalism theories, the latter tends to favor the teaching of a broad liberal arts education. These competing paradigms are also found to influence how journalists evaluate innovative media outlets that have emerged during the reforms. These observations reveal some basic characteristics of journalistic paradigms: an internally coherent configuration, broadly-shared ideas, and a structuration of adherents?reasoning and judgments. The implications of the findings for the understanding of journalistic paradigms, professionalism, globalization, and China掇 media reforms are also discussed.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1036,78,2004,Mass Communication Research

Central to the issue are considerations of fair competition vs. the public interest. This paper argues that fair (and effective) competition is congruent with the public interest. Rather, the two core values of policy concern are complementary to each other and should be integral to the regulatory framework for the broadband video service market in the digital age. It is further argued that digital television in the public interest is depedent upon the implementation of‘open access’(for competitors as well as audiences) to each of the two digital/broadband video service transmission/delivery networks in Taiwan.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1033,78,2004,Mass Communication Research
Preliminary Research on the Labor Dispatch Relationship between Performing Artists and Their Agents,Fu-mei Lin,"dispatch labor, performing artist, agent","This article, based upon the labor dispatch relationship, attempts to discuss the trial subordinate relationship among performing artists, their agents and production unit, and the working model. According to the research findings, the value of performing artists depends on the market reaction.“Opportunity”and“favor”are the“essential”criteria for performing artists to win success. The concepts of gratitude, popularity, and common in the industry, are the utter expressions of the Chinese way for repaying to those who gave favors to them. This kind of relationship somehow results in the following phenomenon: first, the ideology of“favor debt”which makes the performing artists perfunctory or negligent to exploitation by their agents. In another way, it also reinforces the powers held by the agents and the production unit to maintain the organizational efficiency that is necessary for production.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1032,78,2004,Mass Communication Research

The penetration rate of cable television on the island now is more than 80%, which is far past the point of critical mass. This study uses two questions, asking respondents how many years they have had cable television and if they have not adopted cable television, how likely they would adopt cable television in the future.

Public Opinion and Public (Publics): A Critical Interpretation of Taiwan's TV Call-in Programs,Yie-Jing Yang,"public opinion, public, public sphere, communication, call-in discussion program","TV call-in programs have become the best space for representing people's opinions in recent years. This phenomenon of public opinion originating from TV call-in programs is filled with chaos. That is to say, whether the call-in program that carries technology progress (interaction) can reflect the essence of public opinion and democracy or not is always an uncertain question. One of the reasons is that people often ignore discussing the meaning of public opinion from the point of view of the“public”when they face public opinion issues of TV call-in programs. Therefore, the first purpose of this study aims to explore the essence of“public”in public opinion and explains the relationship between public opinion and media representation.

Both quantitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis are used in the study. A sample of 277 articles on colds are selected from China Times, China Times Evening News, United Daily, United Evening News, and Min Seng Bao from April 1, 2001 to March 31, 2002. The results show that more than half of the“colds”stories appeared in diverse forms, with those of Western medical orientation being the most dominant. Colds stories of Western medical orientation focus on epidemiology and medicalization, with health and medical authorities being the most powerful sources in the discourse. Instead of fighting against viruses and germs, colds stories of Chinese or folk medical orientation emphasize Yin-Yang philosophy and provide all sorts of self-care solutions.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1202,79,2004,Mass Communication Research

In comparison with the assumption of generic criticism, this paper argues that Lu is an agent to some degree, and her“personal character”should be regarded as one of the rhetorical constituents of a“rhetorical situation.” These findings also contend that some apologetic elements of Lu's rhetoric produce a“generic paradox”or a violation of apparent rhetorical expectations.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1205,79,2004,Mass Communication Research
"Taiwanese College Students' Media Use, Social Capital, and Political Trust",Bonnie Peng,"media use, social capital, political trust","This study explores Taiwanese college students' media use, social capital, and political trust. It is assumed that Chinese students living in Taiwan will demonstrate a differing picture of social capital when compared to those students of equivalent background in the West. The students?social capital is examined via three perspectives: interpersonal trust (trust of relatives, classmates, neighbors, etc.), life satisfaction (contentment with respect to present condition and future prospects), and in terms of association capital (participating in associations and feeling influential in the group). It is hypothesized that college students?media use and social capital could predict their trust toward the President, Legislation Yuan, Judiciary Yuan, and their voting behavior. The results show that students?life satisfaction and interpersonal trust are significantly related to their political trust. It is found, however, that social capital is not related to students' voting or whether they voted on Election Day.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1204,79,2004,Mass Communication Research

The results also show that newspaper and television news credibility declined significantly from 1992 to 2002. This study also proposes a theoretical model of selective credibility, which predicts that respondents select those newspapers and television news that are in agreement with their existing attitudes and beliefs.

Based on the literature review, this study attempts to examine the differences of upward influence strategies in organizations between Western and Chinese cultures. The study comes up with two major findings regarding the use of upward influence strategies in organizations. First of all, some strategies are used both in Western and Chinese organizations, but their frequencies differ in the two types of organizations. For example, reward-oriented strategies such as inspiration and consulting will be used frequently in Chinese organizations, but rarely employed in Western organizations. Furthermore, this study also finds that other strategies which are positive and rational will be used frequently both in Western and Chinese organizations.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1225,80,2004,Mass Communication Research
An Explication of the Redefined Concept of“Sensationalism” in Television News Magazine Reporting Programs,Tai-Li Wang,"Sensationalism, Tabloid Culture, Television News, TV News Aesthetics","Based on a dual-text content analysis framework, the current research aims at explicating various dimensions of sensationalism in three types of television news programs. The analysis of audio text examines news topics, reporters?narrative modes, and reporting tone. The analysis of visual text scrutinizes eight types of video maneuvers and twenty-two types of post-production with audio and visual effects. Results indicate that, in terms of news topics, tabloid TV reporting programs significantly report more sensational news topics than either elite or popular TV reporting programs. Elite TV reporting programs, though focusing on non-sensational news topics, seldom report politics or economics news. In respect of production forms, tabloid TV reporting programs are found to use most types of video maneuvers, post-visual effects, and post-audio effects to prompt sensory experience of the viewing audience. The implication of such exploratory findings is discussed in the seemingly conflict of traditional news values and TV aesthetics in the digital communication era.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1244,81,2004,Mass Communication Research

It is assumed that journalists are not autonomous individuals, as they are working under institutional and organizational constraints. Interviews with five female journalists at two national newspaper organizations provide a rare glimpse into their contradictory work experiences. These accounts reveal their struggles over altering the narrow image of female politicians at the organizational and institutional levels. All journalists say that they have the most autonomy they could possibly ask for and most claim that they could and should do neutral and objective reports. Paradoxically, journalists acknowledge here that they often present female politicians in news content from a soft and private angle.

The Models of Allotting Spectrums and the Spectrum License Auction,Ping-Hung Chen,"spectrum management, spectrum allotment model, spectrum auction, spectrum act, spectrum regulatory agency","The 20th century has become a wireless era because of the advents in technologies of spectrum digitalization, compression and re-uses. Recently, however, most countries in the world have been aware that wireless sources will become limited. This prompted them to seek optimum solutions to manage and allot radio spectrums more reasonably and efficiently. In spite of the demand for more radio spectrums, Taiwan has not yet had a reliable system to fulfill the call. This study first examines the advantages and disadvantages of various spectrum allotment models. It then employs the Delphi method and focus group discussions to propose an ideal allotment model for Taiwan. Based on the findings, the study suggests that the spectrum regulatory agency should have a balanced consideration between the economic and social values of a spectrum.

Communal Knowledge vs. Objective Knowledge: News in the Light of Electronic Orality,Mary Chin-Hui Shen,"community, electronic news, electronic orality, objectivity, information quality, poetic wisdom","This paper addresses the haunting issue of information quality for time-based electronic news. Inevitably characterized by a sense of immediacy, electronic news has its particularity more as a form of social participation than as a genre for detached observation. Tracing how the canon of journalistic objectivity has gradually become a controversy under the influence of this electronic particularity, the author appeals for the need to reconsider in a new light. Drawing on Eric Havelock and Walter Ong, two types of knowledge are specified: one oral, concrete, participatory, if dramatic and narrative, the other literate, abstract, objectified, if apparently disinterested. The communal sensibility unique of the “electronic orality” is further explored in its connection to “poetic wisdom,” based on which the study concludes with an alternative suggestion.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1257,82,2005,Mass Communication Research

Firstly, through the circle of spectacle-narcissism-spectacle, audiences converge their visions with idolatrous texts while reading deliberately and develop specific significance that centers on their egos, not texts. Secondly, although texts ofpopular culture are for-anyone-structure, they are decoded by audiences in for-someone-structure, thus, wrapping in for-anyone-as-someone structures, audiences exploit“self-love vs. self-hate”complexes while hoping to monopolize the idolatrous author for impressing others with unique lifestyles.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1255,82,2005,Mass Communication Research

Starting with a critique of Dallas Smythe’s concept of a commodity audience, the analysis highlights Marxist communication studies’ oversight of the gender issue. It further empirically questions the myth of objective ratings as commonly practiced in the commercial television industry. By doing so, the study aims to unearth exploitation and discrimination hidden in the family viewing process.

Imagining Public Journalism in Deliberative Democracy: Constructing a News Reporting Model for Deliberating Public Issues,Huiping Huang,"deliberative democracy, public journalism, conflict frame, deliberative reporting","A trend of reflexive thoughts on political philosophy and journalism has emerged recently. While the theory of deliberative democracy aims at rectifying problems of representative democracy, public journalism intends to replace traditional elite-centered reporting with a practice targeted at restoring civic culture. Both ideas emphasize the subjectivity of citizens in political decisions. The practice of deliberative democracy requires publicity, equality, nontyranny and reciprocity. Public journalism offers the opportunities to implement these principles. Inspired by the possible synergy, this study proposes a deliberative reporting model. The model starts from citizens’ concerns and focuses on reporting pluralistic argumentations and justifications of a controversial public issue.

Two major methods are used. The first method consists of a content analysis of 548 print and electronic news articles regarding medical risk information provided by hospitals or medical professionals. The second method is a focus group discussion (FGD) of eight medical journalists from the print and electronic media. The content analysis results show that medical risk information provided by hospitals or medical professionals involves mostly patients’ cases, sometimes where privacy is intruded upon. Medical journalists participating in the FGD indicate that they rely on medical centers as the most credible sources of health information. They also consider the regulation of medical risk information releases and ethical guidelines provided by the Department of Health to be unrealistic.

Both a content analysis and a telephone survey are used in the study, with the former being supplemented by informal personal interviews with program producers. The results show that legislators and journalists comprise the major sources of the talk show guests. Election-related topics are discussed most frequently, followed by party-related topics. Issues related to government efficiency and domestic policy, however, are the least frequently discussed. Furthermore, those who most often call into the programs tend to be men identified with the People-First Party (PFP) with stronger political interests, but a lower level of political knowledge. Those who regularly watch the talk shows, on the other hand, tend to be older PFP-identifying people with stronger interests and higher levels of political knowledge.

The Routinized Mode of Journalists’ Daily Work,Wen-Chiang Chang,"routine, routinization, media organization, competence, passion","This study aims to explore the impact of the routinization of journalists’ daily work, as such routinization has been found to restrain journalists’ professional performance and hinder journalists from self improvement. The study shows that the formation of journalistic routinization is a complex process. It involves fine-tuning between individual journalists and their organizations. Routinization helps professionals establish an order out of chaos, but at the same time it brings in monotony and boredom of daily work. Two dimensions can be summarized from our analysis of journalistic routinization. First, journalists tend to repeat their routines and appear stagnant regarding their professional competence. Secondly, routinization may reflect journalists’ loss of passion over their careers, resulting in low motivation for professional self-improvement. The study ends with suggestions on how journalists can rekindle their career passion from the perspectives of practical work and academic research.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1285,84,2005,Mass Communication Research

Second, we interview ten senior reporters (editors) who have been directly involved in reporting and editing. The interviewees were asked a set of questions referring to their problem-solving processes and experiences, including planning, information collecting, writing, and editing. The study then (1) decomposes the contents and builds the relationships based on the journalistic knowledge structure, (2) designs the system’s internal converting mechanism using XML, and (3) devises a web-based interface. This system serves as an expandable knowledge repository for storing more experts’ experiences and reporting cases in the future. The system also provides timely cognitive support by allowing novices to search and to access knowledge upon their needs and preferences.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1284,84,2005,Mass Communication Research
Marching in the Ruin of Speed: A Materialistic Critique of News in the Electronic Media,Shih-che Tang,"speed, materialistic critique, field, television news","This study seeks to demonstrate and criticize the structural limitation of the mechanism of news production in the electronic media. Taking a materialistic approach, the study argues that the pursuit of absolute speed constitutes to the major cause of news aberration from its designated social responsibility. Speed-driven news production gives rise to a system marked by operational closure, which deprives news from representing social reality. Speed has become the ultimate manipulator of the symbolic violence of the social space. Therefore, a thorough examination of social problems created by television news should start from an investigation of the “field,” characterized by the interaction among the factors of transmission technology, the habitus of industrial competition, and the nature of the televisual image. These interrelated material conditions deprive electronic news of its task in improving social interaction.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1283,84,2005,Mass Communication Research
Searching for the Factors and Motives That Influence Online Fortune-Telling Behavior,Cheng Kuo,"online fortune-telling, motives of fortune-telling, sensation seeking, locus of control, self-esteem, subjective well-being","Online fortune-telling has become quite popular among Internet users, and it may turn out to be quite a promising business as well. This online survey recruited 6,088 Internet users for participation. The author intends to uncover a dynamic psychological model in explaining such online fortune-telling behavior. Three groups of explanatory variables are included: (1) demographics such as gender, age, education, income, and marital status, (2) psychological orientations such as sensation seeking, locus of control, subjective well-being, and self-esteem, (3) motivations such as problem solving, increasing understanding of one’s self and others, fun and curiosity, and Internet utilities. Results from the analyses indicate that the majority of Internet users were attracted to the fortune-telling websites for the free trial services, while only 26% of the respondents admitted that they spent money on the online fortune-telling services during the past six months. Reading about romance is the most popular item among both males and females, followed by careers. The three groups of explanatory variables contributed either positively or negatively to various types of online fortune-telling behavior.

Authoritarian States and Television: A Comparative Study Between Taiwan and South Korea,Lihyun Lin,"television history, authoritarian states, Taiwan, South Korea","Television systems in Taiwan and South Korea had similar starting points, but followed different routes in the 1980s. This paper mainly asks the question: In what historical contexts have the two countries made options? To approach the problem, this paper analyzes the logic and contradictions of the two states from a wider historical perspective. It mainly argues that authoritarian states tend to have a legitimacy crisis and are forced to adopt certain social controls, but lose certain powers. In Taiwan the party-state mainly adopted co-option measures, but sacrificed state autonomy on television policy. In South Korea the military-bureaucratic regime strongly intervened into the structure of the media and forced the private televisions to merge with the state enterprise. After the ownership transformation, media reform movements in South Korea rose up and demanded that the state television stations fulfill public responsibilities. We can thus conclude that, after the ownership of TV has been transformed from private into public ownership, media reform groups can make further improvements.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=180,85,2005,Mass Communication Research

Based on the plethora of theories and research studies on international news flow presented in the past decades, this study analyzes foreign news coverage portrayed in Taiwanese newspapers from 1988 to 1999 in four major Taiwanese newspapers in terms of categories such as reported area, reported country, size, valence, and sources. The results show that these selected Taiwanese newspapers have been consistently biased to favor events emerged in the First World countries, and not surprisingly the United States continues to be the most covered nation in all these four newspapers. Eliteness, geographical distance, and negativity of news events are concluded to be the three major factors determining foreign news reporting in Taiwanese newspapers.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=183,85,2005,Mass Communication Research
The Impact of Media Use on Zhuhai Audiences’ Perceived City Image of Macao,"Guang Yang, Huailin Chen","city image, cultivation analysis, cross-border communication, China study, media effects, media credibility","This study explores a new topic -- city image -- in the field of communication research. With a multi-stage cluster sampling process, over 1,000 Zhuhai residents were randomly selected and then interviewed face to face. The findings reveal that Zhuhai residents hold a fairly positive image of Macao, and in a multiple channel message system the local media are still the major source through which they learn about their neighbor Macao. At the explanative level, the study finds that media attention and media credibility are much more powerful predictors for perceived city image than that of media exposure. After testing a new atypical Cultivation Analysis model and a set of hypotheses, we do find that people’s first-order city images (specific impressions) are closely connected with their second-order city images (general perceptions and acceptance of city symbols). The proposed model and hypotheses are partially supported.

A Cross Symbol Study: The Blueprint of a Communication Grand Theory Through Inter-Construction between Structure/Action,Yaly Chao,"meta model, meta discourse, video description, science communication, cross-symbol model, communication grand theory","The term “cross symbol” borrows from the “Cross Culture” study, implying to explore the specific proposition of how meaning is translated between different symbol systems, to recognize, discriminate, and authenticate the nature of each symbol system itself, and to cross the limitation that a symbol system is itself unable to be self-examined. This article points out the cross symbol model containing two significant features: first, to emphasize the nature of inter-construction between structure and action, and second, to stress the mechanism of mutual recognition between structure and action. The communication model of cross symbols also has another two-folded meaning: one is to deepen our recognition and understanding of each symbol system as well as to differentiate the differences among them by cross comparing different symbol systems, and the second is to emphasize the interrelated and inter-constructed nature between structure and action on the basis of epistemology. Using the cross symbol model as a conceptual framework not only can fully integrate two entirely different communication images based on the transmission model with the constitutive model, but it can also provide an operating platform of meta-discourse as a mechanism for dialogues among the seven different traditions of communication theory and further develop a blueprint of a communication grand theory in the process.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=898,86,2006,Mass Communication Research

Moreover, the news reports mainly focus on a lower process of science production and social influence domain, which relatively miss the report on high-level science issues. Furthermore, there are also high frequency uses of translation reports.

Time spent on the Internet is further categorized into time spent on the Internet for work and time spent on the Internet for pleasure. Motives for Internet use include information search, social interaction and entertainment. The relationship between time spent on the Internet and Internet use motives and political participation as well as social capital is examined.

The analysis herein uses a 4 (news framing of transmission routes) ×2 (gender) ×2 (places of residence) factorial design. A total of 960 young adults from Taipei city and Kaohsiung county participated in the experiment. Data collected are primarily analyzed using multivariate covariate analysis (MANCOVA). The results show that participants tend to express positive attitudes toward PLWHAs’ rights for education, work and living, and interaction with and helping out PLWHAs. Participants are, however, more reserved in supporting PLWHAs’ rights for marriage and birth-giving. Those expressing more positive views about homosexuality indicate a stronger intention to interact with or help PLWHAs and have more positive attitudes towards PLWHAs’ rights for education, work and living. They also are likely to support PLWHAs’ rights for marriage and birth-giving more. Those who are assigned to “man-to-man-sex” news condition express the least negative attitude toward PLWHAs’ rights for marriage and birth-giving. Men are more likely than women to show positive attitudes towards PLWHAs’ rights for education, work and living, and to interact with PLWHAs.

Looking at the Invisible: The Concept of the Gaze,Guan-hua Huang,"fantasy, lack, gaze","This paper is a theoretical endeavor to explicate the elusive and invisible characters of Lacanian “gaze”, as well as the ways that the gaze functions like the object a in the constitutive relationship between the subject and the Other. In addressing the Gaze’s significant role that subsists along the function of the Symbolic within Lacan’s psychoanalytic framework, this paper further provides the concept of the gaze with specific modalities (“an imagined gaze” and “an impossible gaze”), manifested in terms of the subject’s specific relations to an ultimate lack of such in the Other. To do so precisely, these modalities of psychic economy are also discussed in detail with regards to their relevance to concepts like fantasy, desire and jouissance. What should be mostly emphasized in the conception of Lacanian gaze, as this paper demonstrates, is not only the necessity of its functioning in the scopic register which makes one to see, but also the impossibility of seeing it at all in the ultimate sense of a structural lack. As is shown in Lacan’s theoretical edifice, it is this paradoxical encounter between the subject and the gaze that constitutes the very condition in which any creative seeing or imagination becomes possible.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=903,87,2006,Mass Communication Research
"The Restoration, Continuity, and Fragmentation of Historical Memory in Print Media’s Nostalgic Construction of the Native “Old” Taiwan",Yi-Chien Lee,"nostalgia, collective memory, popular history, historical continuity, postmodernism","This study examines texts featuring nostalgia for the native “old” Taiwan in books and magazines published in recent years, analyzes their strategies of representation and discursive frameworks, and contextualizes nostalgia within the larger circumstances of contemporary social and cultural changes. The finding suggests that the current nostalgic impulse can be viewed as a conjunction of reactions against historical amnesia as a result of Taiwan’s previous martial law and the threat of a postmodern historical crisis. Building upon pop history and collective memory, nostalgia in print media resists the former official discourse on history, attempts to reconstruct a new cultural subjectivity, and provides the myth of continuity in order to overcome the threat of postmodern fragmentation. However, though they reproduce dominant ideologies and are shaped by print media’s aesthetic, nostalgia texts tend to over-glorify the past and systematically suppress historical diversities and traumas.

Based on my four years experience working as an ethnographer for an online fan community, three stages have observed regarding the critical capability of audiences. In the first stage, the operation of the imagination should be taken when audiences translated their experiences to a thought-object. In the second stage, the general communicability is the core criterion that audiences elaborate their thinking fruit to the public. In the third stage, audiences visit each other’s position in imagination with homeless thought. The combination of all these stages help to promote the proposal that the critical capability of audiences is based on the process, not the outcome, of thinking and the meaning built by audiences themselves is the starting point of the thinking journey.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=913,88,2006,Mass Communication Research
Media Competition and Content Diversity in Taiwan: Effects of Inter-Media and Intra-Media Competitions,"Chen-Yi Lee, Shu-Chu Sarrina Li","content diversity, market competition, newspapers industry","With the lifting of Taiwan’s martial law in 1988, the newspaper industry in Taiwan faced three types of competition in the past decade. Firstly, the legalization of cable television in 1993 brought more than five 24-hour news channels to the market, which caused a lot of people to rely on television instead of newspapers for their news. Secondly, the emergence of electronic newspapers also changed the reading habits of the public, which threatened the advertising income of the newspaper industry in Taiwan. Thirdly, the Hong-Kong based newspaper, the Apple Daily, began its operation in Taiwan’s market starting June 2003, which directly altered the market structure of Taiwan’s newspaper industry. Using industrial organization theory as the theoretical framework, this study attempts to understand the relationship between market competition and content diversity in Taiwan’s newspaper industry. The method of content analysis was adopted to investigate how content diversity of newspapers varies with the three types of competition mentioned above.

"When Newsmen Become Critics: Inquiry of Fame, Profession and Labor Commodification",Fu-Mei Lin,"name-based, professional autonomy, alienated labor, commodification","This text aims at exploring how the professional labor of newsmen-/newswomen-turned critics, whose fame is based on their professional reputations, would be affected by the mechanisms of survival habitus and commodification. This analysis finds that fame, a vital labor capital of newsmen/women, would have a direct impact on labor payment and job opportunity. Once the focus of concern targets on self-interest rather than a common progress of society, symbolic capitals such as fame and image would relay their foundations on a concern with labor income. To obtain a greater room for performance, individual professional actors would also construct their survival habitus by the structure of production. In other words, when profession and fame are commercialized, they are not only a symbol concerning self-interest but also one concerning a variety of interests, having to depend upon commercial values or face the consequence of losing exchange values. Through the name-based rational choice, the professional foundation on which a newsman’s fame was originally laid would change its nature as a result.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=912,88,2006,Mass Communication Research
Media Use and Political Capital,"Yi-Ning Katherine Chen, Ven-hwei Lo","political capital, media content use, time spent on media","This study explores the concept of political capital and its relationship with various forms of media use. The results show that political capital is a complex concept that includes five basic dimensions: political networking, political interests, political knowledge, political trust, and political participation. The results of the study also show that time spent on watching TV, reading the newspaper, and surfing the Internet are quite limited in predicting political capital, while the extent of exposure to newspaper political news is a significant predictor for political networking, opinion expression, campaign participation, political knowledge, and political interest. The preceding does not include cultivating political trust. The extent of exposure to TV political news significantly predicts campaign participation, political knowledge, and political interest. Exposure to political news on the Internet can predict opinion expression, political knowledge, and political interests. Overall, this study shows that political content exposure is a better predictor for political capital than overall time spent on viewing media.

This study finds that the game practices of schoolchildren who come from indigenous and low-income families are influenced and limited by the local culture in which they live. When they play computer games, their gender identity is most prominent in the eyes of others. This work presents four important findings: (1) Schoolchildren are aware of the gendered characteristics of computer games, and also exhibit their gender by playing games. (2) Gender is an influential factor in children’s game preferences and tastes--boys prefer the mastery pattern and girls favor the sociable pattern. (3) Schoolchildren’s game-playing practices are involved in collective accomplishment and power struggle. Within the context of the computer lab, gender-based peer groups will influence and limit schoolchildren’s game practices. Because of a fear of being isolated, they avoid gender-atypical play, with the exception of a few.

First, I will demonstrate how the organization of photojournalists’ work in Taiwan achieves efficiency at the expense of workers’ burnout. Second, I document how male photojournalists adopt the discourse of “burnout” to display their commitment to their work and contradict the crisis of masculinity. Female journalists, on the other hand, tend to be viewed as deviant workers who have difficulty living up to the organizational requirements and expectations. Furthermore, by analyzing the narratives of photojournalists and their supervisors within news companies, I demonstrate that the archetype of an “ideal photojournalist” is associated with highly romanticized “manhood.” In this vein, rather than viewing work organizations as neutral, rational and objective, I argue that the assumption of sexuality and gender in actuality exercises the discursive power to perpetuate the occupational sex segregation of photojournalists’ work in Taiwan.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1054,91,2007,Mass Communication Research

The Transformation of Korean Film Financing and Film Production,Yu kyeong Lim,"open up market, investment partnership, policy, venture capital corporation, Korean film","Korea had opened up its film market in 1988. The outlook of the Korean film industry was generally pessimistic because it was opened during a period when the industry was not fully mature. However, the market share of the Korean domestic film industry has gradually risen since 1993. After the success of “Shwiri” in 1999, Korean films have displayed remarkable advancement and improvement. It can be said that the primary cause for such remarkable improvement in the Korean film industry was the change in production values. The transformation of the Korean film financing has been a significant factor since the opening of the film market in 1988. The transformation of film financing is the most important element in changing the production values. For the fluctuation of financing, the preceding change in government policy is an indispensable condition. Therefore, this thesis analyzes the effects which the transformation of the Korean film financing has influenced film production through the change in government policy before and after the opening of the film market in 1988 based on the media economy.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1057,91,2007,Mass Communication Research
The Third-Person Effect and a New Social Movement Model in Television Reform: A Survey of Residents in Kaohsiung City and County,"Chih-hsien Chen, Lola C.P.

The third-person effect as well as other possible influential factors are also taken into account and empirically examined in a telephone survey. According to the statistical results of a path analysis, residents with a higher education, media efficacy, and regulatory views tend to support television reform. Contrary to the hypothesis of the third-person effect, the study argues that the less negative impacts on both themselves and others are presumed by those respondents, the more likely that they will support television reform. A new social movement model has been tested and suggested as a better approach to comprehend television reform in southern Taiwan.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1056,91,2007,Mass Communication Research
The Perception Structure Revealed in the Y2K Crisis: Starting a Research in the Phenomenological Domain,Hui-Wen Liu,"Y2K, phenomenological domain, computer-mediated technology","This paper aims to make an example of research practicing in the Phenomenological domain to enrich the CMC studies. This research is grounded on a “computerized society” developed by Lyotard as a methodological base, and on the Y2K crisis as the critical case. The author tries to reveal the “perception structure of ‘technology-humanity’ ”. Via Kuhn’s concept of paradigms and Beck’s concept of a risk society, we can explain the sense of absurdity caused by the Y2K crisis. As we understand the origin of the sense of absurdity, we can be released from it.

Dialectic between Media Literacy and Freedom of Speech,Weber H. W. Lai,"free market, freedom of speech, literacy, media, media literacy","Taiwan’s Ministry of Education officially announced its “Media Literacy Education Policy White Paper” on October 24, 2002. But while vigorous progress has been made in the field, this study is quite limited in its delineation of media literacy’s theoretical foundations, This leaves much room for further discussions. In fact, there has been a lack of theoretical literature covering media literacy studies in Taiwan. As this paper points to the concept of a “healthy community” as its theoretical base, it is suggested that the discussion of such media issues must be related to issues about the concept of freedom of speech. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to examine certain aspects of media literacy’s theoretical foundations by analyzing the dialectic between media literacy and the freedom of speech.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1062,92,2007,Mass Communication Research

This research investigates the impact of patterns of interpersonal discussion and media use on media participation intention. We also examine the role of media production knowledge and media participation efficacy as mediators in the flow of influence. Data collected from face-to-face interviews taken from a random sample of 600 Beijing residents show that media production knowledge has little effect on media participation intention. The media uses habits and interpersonal discussion as a multi-dimensional concept exerts direct influence on efficacy and behavioral intention, more so for reflective speakers than discussion followers.

On the one hand, The Chinese government encouraged Internet development. However, on the other hand, it set up a firewall and tried to close down some deviant websites. It shows the contradictions of the Chinese leaders towards the Internet industry. From the perspective of “publicity” practice in the Internet forum, this study analyzed the public opinions posted on the Internet forums in the following three news events, which were the “BMW car accident”, “the arrest of the editors of the ‘Southern Metropolis Daily’”, and the “Anti-Japan demonstration”. The four findings are as follows: (1) the Internet forum provides the function of “publicity” and offers more space for the discussion of public issues and access rights to its users, (2) the Internet forum inspires participations and forms a new constructing meaning system, (3) the Internet forum changes the traditional propaganda control, (4) and the Internet forum has been interfered by the state apparatus. Moreover, there are two phenomenon: the power elites play the role of opinion leaders in the Internet forum, and the Internet forum has the strength to launch social mobilization. Finally, the development of the Internet forum has created a collision between the state apparatus and itself. As a result, the Internet forum undermined the government media’s power of setting the agenda and weakened the power of propaganda control.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1063,92,2007,Mass Communication Research
The Labor Consciousness in the Stock Right Shifting for Party-Owned Media: A Case Study of China Television Company,Huei-Ling Liu,"labor consciousness, labor process, Collective bargaining agreement","For the past two years, the KMT owned media was in a state of uncertainty because of the withdrawal from the media due to broadcasting and TV laws. During the stock right shifting, how do the laborers collectively take action and strive for their rights and interests? What will be the labor consciousness represented during this time? The China Television Company (CTV) is one of the most successful cases among these party-owned media. This research focuses on the CTV case study to answer these questions with a field study approach. This research suggests that there are two characteristics for CTV labor consciousness: (1) many fit the profile of a white-collar class lacking a collective consciousness, (2) they are obedient and moderate under the long standing KMT leadership.

The content analysis indicated that call-in programs in Taiwan exhibited the following aspects: (1) they discussed more breaking news than general public policies, (2) they contained party biases, and (3) they framed topics in a negative light. With regard to these findings, we propose that there are three major motives for watching political call-in programs: seeking knowledge, looking for party identification and serving as entertainment. A telephone survey found that seeking knowledge was a significant predictor of viewing frequency. In addition, age and education predicted the degree to which viewers sought knowledge from watching call-in programs.

In a sense, we consider creativity/innovation as a way to reflect the concept of time. Changing the meaning of time in any object may bring a process of re-definition, and therefore it may be considered as being innovative or creative. In the final section of this study, we emphasize the role of a time narrative (story-telling) in creativity/innovation, because how a concept is expressed in terms of temporality determines its innovativeness/creativity.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1071,93,2007,Mass Communication Research

Using the critical discourse analysis, this study analyzed headlines, contents, the news sources, quotes, actor reenactments and various media content. 102 news articles published in five major newspapers in Taiwan were included in the analyzed sample. The results showed that the news coverage highlighted conflicts and emphasized tragic events which blurred the focus of medical disputes. Additionally, the news coverage highlighted images of powerless patients confronting large medical institutions, and allowed doctors to respond to patients’ accusations using medical jargon. The media has the potential to be a channel in which patients can use to search for justice.

Three conclusions are reached: (1) Even though Chinese rarely adopted negatively- oriented strategies solely in upward communication, they are often used in combination with other positive strategies to ensure that the relationship with superiors is not jeopardized. (2) The fact of the Chinese preferred to use positively-oriented strategies in upward communication is confirmed by the high frequency of positive strategies used in the study. The results furthermore indicated that not only a greater variety of positive strategies have been used, but also these strategies have been applied in a more delicate manner, which is consistent with the situation-centered characteristic of the Chinese culture. (3) As expected, the strategies of logic used in upward communication are just as often as in the Western societies, however, some specific strategies in the logic group have never been discussed in previous Western literature.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1075,94,2008,Mass Communication Research

Following an argument from McLuhanian theory names “psychotechnology” which means the co-constructive relationship between media technology and audiences, this article explores the new cultural politics on reality TV in the context of digital and global era. The conclusion indicates that the reality TV audiences are getting rather eager to see a more technologically confirmed and immediately live spectacle, which are considered to be more real. The audiences are also becoming a technologically skilled audience, who embodies the mediated sensibility and possesses all kinds of media literacy and collective intelligence to response and intervene into the reality claim of reality shows.

The results indicated that for both discussion groups, the topics were mostly information-related. Thus, the types of social support were primarily information-focused. More female members participated in both discussion groups than the males. Female members tended to provide a combination of informational and network types of support only. Not much nonverbal cues were used in both discussion groups.

Using the 1998 rape photo incident of Indonesia Chinese women as an example, three kinds of texts, the original, the mainstream newspaper, and those from the general public were compared. The analyses of the results indicated that since those brutal pictures being hyperlinked to the online forum of the United Morning Psot of Singapore were all removed from the linking websites, the original text from the forum at the same time lost its authenticity. The historical testimonies provided by the United Daily News of Taiwan and the Google search engine were very different by nature. The former one was relatively remote and objective, but the latter one acknowledged that those brutal pictures could play a crucial role in online historical construction of reality. Due to the writing of history involved a blending of fact and fiction, the authenticity of the story itself declined as well.

A Historical Experiment with Deregulation: The Changes and Challenges of the Press after the Lifting of the Press Ban in Taiwan,Lihyun Lin,"Deregulation, Press Ban, Press policy, Press history","Amid Taiwan’s political transition, the press ban was lifted in 1988. It was aimed at enhancing free competition, avoiding monopolies, and creating a healthy media environment. Since then, new problems have emerged, while old ones remained unsolved. Among these concerns, the questions of this paper include (1) how did de-regulation take place and, (2) how did the press change afterwards. According to the historical analyses of the paper, the press had been protected under the authoritarian regime and its structure, distorted. In lifting the ban, the government was inactive and favorable to the incumbents, however, deregulation has buried the seeds of crisis for the press. Without any regulation concerning concentration of ownership, internal democracy and market practices, the big newspapers soon won the competition by unfair practices. Owners of some big newspapers even used the press to express their political interests. The new comer, with its business backgrounds, also followed this kind of strategy by price-cutting and conducting prize-drawing campaigns. As the competition became tougher, the press became weaker and eventually started declining. Therefore, it can be concluded that in the political transition process, it is vital to lay out a regulatory framework in order to build a sound media environment.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1081,95,2008,Mass Communication Research

Using the popular T.V. show “The Lecture Room” as an example, scholars on television is highly approved by the majority of the people who work in the academic field, especially by Dr. Dan-Qin Chen, who were once a professor teaching art at Tsinghua University, Beijing. Due to the production principle and sieving mechanism, scholars being chosen to be on the T.V. show, “The Lecture Room”, are mostly characterized as the “knowledge type” of scholars, who are usually lack the quality of critical thinking, which on the other hand is a key characteristic shared by those “thought type” of scholars, who are rarely invited to be on the show. According to J.P Satre, one of the greatest existentialists in 20th century, the purpose of scholars being on mass media is not only to disseminate more advanced knowledge, but also to encourage thought interaction and stimulate critical thinking. These scholars are what he called the “New Intellectuals”. However, based on the current situation of scholars on T.V., Satres’ ideal scholar identity is totally diminished by the show production group.

The analyses are constructed from the point of views on a specific political party and the organization format of the party’s newspaper, and how they are related to the culture and society of Taiwan. The interaction between the newspaper organization and the political party has always been based on the traditional ideation of authoritarianism which has always been the core policy of how political culture is managed in Taiwan. However, on the other hand, some radical members in the society at the same time have been trying to revolt such a tradition by declaiming against authoritarianism and mobilizing democratism. Under this condition, the content of Central Daily News seems to be meaningless and lack of the kind elements the society has requested for. In other words, the newspaper marketing mechanism has faced the dilemma of whether follow through the tradition of its authoritarian system or adapt to the trend of democracy among the field of mess media. Finally, the paper also raises the suggestions of the solution for the transformation dilemma of political party’s newspapers, that is, the policy system should be more exoteric and negotiable in order to accommodate the needs for democracy in the society.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1101,97,2008,Mass Communication Research
Rethinking the Role of Public Sphere on Internet: A Phenomenological Perspective,Hui-Wen Liu,"Internet, Public Sphere, Phenomenology, epoch?","Internet has been popular for more than ten years. During all these years, people have been expecting internet to work as a public sphere in terms of the distinguished technological traits. Taking the low access threshold and unlimited capacity for every kind of speech to focus, internet performances indeed reflect a well-constructed framework for fulfilingl what Habermas described as Public Sphere. However, the technological traits seem to direct how we think about internet rather than explain it based on the experienced reality. The public focuses too much on the conceptual construction, somehow disregards the fact that the theoretical concept doesn’t always equal to the reality. Thus, with the help of Phenomenological epoché, this paper tried to move back to experience to see what the term ‘Public Sphere’ really means on internet. This paper indicated two critical cases to explore how the users of internet view the concept. It is found that internet maybe the main character when discussing about ‘Public Sphere’ but traditional mass communication, such as newspapers, actually provide the stage to perform. The visibilities degree of speech on internet are actually the real threshold that has to be faced.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1103,97,2008,Mass Communication Research

Civic Media Reform Movement in the U.S.A: 1920s-2007,"Liu Xue, Xiang Zongping","civic media reform movement, broadcast, television, media legislation, civil society","The media is the pillar of most democratic societies. However, current commercial media system has jeopardized democracy, making media democracy an empty promise. With the growth of the civic society, it has attempted to save the media and democracy through media reform. Among the capitalist countries, the U.S has always put the greatest emphasis on market freedom and it also has the most commercialized media, hence the country has the longest and most influential civic media reform movement. In the 1920s and early 1930s, some educational institutions took an active part in the law-making process with an attempt to establish a non-commercial broadcast system for the society. In the 1960s and early 1970s, along with the civil rights movement and the feminist movement, the dissatisfaction of the civil society with the television stimulated civic media reform movement reflected an even wider scale. Besides educational institutions, more social groups and civic organizations also got involved in the television reform movement. The beginning of the 21st century witnessed the increasing media monopoly, and such change has aroused more influential civic media reform movement with even more participants. New reform movements are no longer confined to involvement in monitoring and regulating media. Structural agendas such as substantial legislation issues are also included. With the accumulation and continuation of almost a century, the U.S civic media reform movement has a growing public participation as well as increasingly noticeable social effects. However, due to the limitations of the liberal social system and values, the development of the civic media reform is facing some practical difficulties.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1100,97,2008,Mass Communication Research
The Press Reform in Korea,Lihyun Lin,"media reform, press policy, Korea, political transition","As the theory of elite continuity has indicated, the incumbent press continued its domination in Korea’s political transition, however, media reformers have tried to challenge the current situation. This paper primarily focuses on the issues of (1) how press development is like and the continuation of its domination, (2) types of policy alternatives which the media reform groups proposed and (3) in the tug-of-war between the progressive and conservative forces, how the Press Law was changed afterwards. According to the analyses of this paper, under the authoritarian rule, the Korean press had been protected and developed into oligopoly. After deregulation, with firm base the incumbents won the competition by unfair practices. To dismantle this oligopoly, media reformers have followed a “radical market approach” and proposed an alternative press policy. Some of their ideas were brought into the new Press Law after long confrontation and negotiations. Hence, the conclusion is that the continuities of media power in political transition still exits, however, by proposing policy alternatives and taking actions, media reform groups could become an important force.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1098,97,2008,Mass Communication Research

This paper primarily reviews and examines the progress of Malaysian media reform action. It also further more reveals that the media reform action has emerged in a more organizational way till after 1998 under the continuously suppression by the government. The related idea of reform, however, seems hard to be universal and deepen into the grass-root level. It meets the constraints of languages, race and religion which have caused difficulties to increase the public participation. In other words, all these obstacles entangled by the media reform aggravates the hardship to expand. This paper then suggests that the media reform organization should grasp the opportunities to identity and to clarify its aspirations and missions following by the sudden change of domestic political scene. Despite the de-regulation effort of the state's strict manipulation towards media, it should urge and monitor the government to further the rational media policy agenda in order to modify the chronically distorted media establishment, and to avoid the media conglomerates harm the public interests in the name of liberalization.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1097,97,2008,Mass Communication Research

Participants were all recruited from Taiwan. Through interview and behavior observation were used as the method to collect data from the MMORPG players’ interpretations of their experiences. The results reflected two types of pleasure players obtained from the on-line game. First, the definition of the game rules brings a lot of pleasures to players during the moments of the human-computer interaction. Second, the intimacy of offline peer groups and cybercommunity become another important source of game pleasures, while that happens in the interpersonal communication. The second pleasure eventually becomes the major cause which players immerse in the game world, and may induce the internet addition disorder.

At first this article analyzes, using a comparative law approach, the reporter’s privilege doctrine developed during the last century in American legal system and then considers its applications in today’s digital lives. This article points out that the controversies surrounding the definition of “journalist” has dominated the discourse over the reporter’s privilege for several decades and has apparently become a pressing issues as the advent of the Internet gave rise to new media and unconventional way of reporting. It further suggests that any articulation of the reporter’s privilege must account for this changing nature of journalism and then proposes that all those who disseminate information to the public must be presumptively entitled to invoke the privilege’s protections. Finally, this article concludes by proposing a functional approach, a qualified privilege proposal under which the fundamental interest in preserving the value of freedom of the press and the other fundamental interest of justice and fairness will be appropriately reconciled.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1109,98,2009,Mass Communication Research

This study specifically focused on the analysis of Ying-Jeou Ma to learn the process of celebrification coupled with Gans description of the norms among news reporting. The questions this study primarily asked are how the politician, Ying-Jeou Ma’s image has been constructed in the mainstream media, and how the three leading newspapers in Taiwan turned a public official into a celebrity and what impact the process of celebrification have caused on the more traditional political coverage. The results which were based on random sample news reporting in the past 10 years indicated that some newspapers have been followed a framing continuum, in which some news did indeed contain components of celebrification while others corresponded to a more traditional hard news. The results reflected no differences among three leading newspapers of reporting Ying-Jeou Ma’s “political styles” and “parasocial interaction”. And on top of these, some novel tactic of adding new elements such as the politician’s “personal characteristics” have been increasing in the narratives. Nevertheless, the results indicated that growing presence within our media assures that the mass media in Taiwan has tendency to boast every facet of a politician’s personal life into a glaring spotlight of the public sphere.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1123,99,2009,Mass Communication Research

Despite these valuable contribu-tions, the previous studies have almost neglected the institutional context and interview design before interview. The interview design before news inter-view not only influences the interaction between the interviewer and the interviewee, but demonstrates the dynamic relationship between the structure and interviewers’ agency.

In developing the concepts of citationality and situationality in identity performative, it builds a link between Butler and Goffman both theoretically and methodologically. Via discourse analysis, the case study maps out the way in which a major tongzhi forum provides a social space that allows the emergence of speech acts citing discourses concerning tongzhi identity as well as those positioning oneself situationally in debates on tongzhi body and tongzhi activism.

Implications of Tagging on Classification and Knowledge: A Case Study on flickr’s Homepage Photos,"Hsiao-Mei Wu, Chih-Yi Chou","tag, folksonomy, flickr, knowledge, groups","The rise of Web 2.0 stimulates a user-centered, bottom-up, and multiply interactive model of communication. One of its key concepts, tagging, the foundation of folksonomy, encourages users to create keywords with natural thoughts. As a result, traditional taxonomy that symbolizes the top-down, expert-oriented power structure is no longer dominating the order of classification, which has significant impacts on our understanding of knowledge construction. This paper empirically examines 19 photos, 324 tags from the flickr homepages. Four main categories are formulated in such unorganized tagging order: (1) those related to the subjects of photos, (2) those tagged for public sharing, (3) those meant to identify as self-collections, and (4) the affective tags. The findings indicate that tags are better categorized in terms of function rather than taxonomical object. Since rational objects and emotional feelings can both be accommodated for classification, tagging in effect minimizes the distance between normalized knowledge and everyday life experience, dissolving the boundaries of subject and object, rational and sentimental, as well as hierarchical and parallel oppositions. It is expected that the play of signifiers will be a significant role in the production of knowledge in the near future.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1115,99,2009,Mass Communication Research

Toward the Ontology of Velocity: Risk at the Age of Real-time Media,Hou-ming Huang,"philosophy of technology, Heidegger, McLuhan, Virilio, Stiegler","With the concept of speed, this paper intends to refresh our understanding of the thought of certain thinkers in order to reflect on the characteristic of modern society. Starting from Heidegger’s ontology of technology, the author tries to reinterpret the media theory of McLuhan, Stiegler’s book on technics, speed, and time, and Virilio’s dromology to illuminate that the relationships between human beings and speed is one of ontological one with its risk regarding the essence of human nature. However, with the advance of modernization and the acceleration of technology and media to the instantaneity of real-time, our ability to control this development always lags further behind the immediate happening of the risk and the speedy change of technology and our social, cultural milieu. In order not to lose control of this process of speed-up, it is necessary for us to elaborate the conceptual and theoretical contents of ontology of velocity to capture the mechanism of this transformation.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1139,101,2009,Mass Communication Research
The Third-Person Effect of the Presidential Debate in Taiwan 2008,Sue-Jen Lin,"first-person effect, presidential debate, presidential election, third-person effect, voting behaviors","Using the third-person effect hypothesis, this study investigated percep-tions of voters on the effect of the 2008 presidential debate in Taiwan and the perceptions of correlation to supporting future presidential debates and voting behaviors. Message desirability was determined by party affiliations of voters and their evaluations regarding candidates’ performance. An analysis on the responses from 784 random-sampled participants revealed that when participants believed their own candidate performed less satisfied than the candidate of the other party, they reported that they were not much influenced, however they claimed that others would be. This third-person differential diminished when DPP’s supporters believed their candidate’s performance was better than KMT’s candidate. A significant correlation indicated not supporting future presidential debates and third-person perception level. The third-person differential was positively correlated to the likelihood to vote and negatively correlated to the intentions to discuss the debate with others and change the vote decision, which expands third-person behavioral domains beyond censorship issues.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1141,101,2009,Mass Communication Research
“Secrecy of Investigation” vs. “Freedom of the Press” A Study to Explore the Clash in the Tug of War between Police and Media Reporters,"Hsiang Chen, Lee-Jay Sun","secrecy investigation, presumption of innocence, freedom of the press, the right to know, the fourth estate","The principles of “secrecy of investigation” and the right to “freedom of the press” are respectively the foundations of “presumption of innocence.” The former principle guards against most unreviewed sentences of suspects by the juridical system. The latter is so called the fourth power, and which attempts to strictly monitor governmental behaviors and in the meantime to prevent from abusing their authorities. In practice, these two principles are conflicting with one another, like the clash of tug of war, requiring a sensitive balance to both sides. This study explores two questions: “Without violating the principle of ‘secrecy of investigation’, how do the police respond to the needs requested by the freedom of press and protect the right to know?” and “How do the media reporters break the limits of secrecy of investigation to safeguard the right to know and the freedom of press?” Six simulated situations, adapted and complied from real cases, are employed as the data collecting tools to elicit both selected journalists and investigation squad chiefs by in-depth interviews. Though establishing from conflicting positions, comparisons were aimed to find out the similarities and maximum agreement between the squad chiefs and journalists. Four conclusions were reached: (1) the police should learn about which action would violate the principle of secrecy of investigation and what legal or administrative liability would ensue, (2) the police should understand the needs of the media and provide journalists with information within reasonable scope for media coverage, (3) the police should be assissted by new devices and related technologies to meet reporters’ needs, and (4) the government should cooperate with the media to modify laws which can effectively regulate related issues.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1140,101,2009,Mass Communication Research
Chinese Subtitle Groups and the Neoliberal Work Ethic,Kelly Hu,"Chinese subtitle groups, neoliberal work ethic, information economy, immaterial labor, free labor, global production system","This article explore the ways in which Chinese online subtitle activities construct multi-layered cultural geography, converge the transnational flows of images, activate the transformation of technological forms of life (from living room TV to computer with the Internet access), and collect online Chinese fan groups to plug into the unauthorized information technology, and be engaged with affective/immaterial/free labor. This study found that the techniques of competition and performance, self-training and self-enhancement, self-interest and self-benefit, calculable ratioanality and self-government in neoliberal society are skillfully incorporated into the work ethic of Chinese subtitle groups. Through the combination between the neoliberal work ethic and non-commercial altruism, a new specific kind of labor value is invented, which challenges capitalist commercial purpose is a necessary condition for neoliberalism. Finally, this research proposes that the fansub cultural phenomenon should be contextually comprehended through the lens of ‘the labor competition due to China’s huge population’ and ‘China’s positioning and production value in a global production system. The neoliberal competition among Chinese subtitle groups are intimately associated with the rise of China in a global market, which triggers the nationalist thirst for progress and the desires to keep updated with globalized fashionable consumption and modernity.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1138,101,2009,Mass Communication Research

J-pop, invented as a fashionable sub-genre by a FM radio station in the late 1980s, expanded its category throughout the 1990s and covers virtually all musical genres for young people in Japan. However, due to the lasting economic recession, the development of digital technology and the transformation of young people’s lifestyle, the record industry faced a serious crisis during the 2000s.

This paper argues that the Korean citizens’ eagerness to plug into modernity and become forerunner in the world has boosted the quick boom of information capitalism accentuated with nationalistic pride. Besides that, the main focus of this paper aims to map the ways in which different groups of Korean youth are engaged in various forms of online networking and invent subjectivities in an age of information society since 80s until now. It should be noticed that the popularity of information technologies has cultivated the marginalized Korean youth to empower themselves and construct “temporary autonomous zone” to resist the Korean authority and patriarchy through online gathering and activities. For example, in recent years the self-labeled “pay-in” (the unemployed Korean youth) rediscover their worth and energy as long as they stay online either in Internet café or at home. Although Korean cyberspace has been gradually commercialized and lost in consumer society, it is hoped that Korean young netizens could insist on getting out of the domination of capitalist hegemony and taking off on their own tracks through reclaiming the power of information exchange for free, freedom, creativity and political agenda.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1136,101,2009,Mass Communication Research

The findings indicate that the U.S. news organizations tend to be more professional, followed by the pan-Blue’s Lianhe Bao, China’s People’s Daily Network, and the Ziyou Shibao group. Although the latter three can be professional, they are more likely to be organic, and their critical role is also quite weak.

Interaction between Organization Control and News Professional Autonomy: International News Editor/Translators at Taiwan Newspapers,"Yen-chieh Lo, Jia-wei Liu, Chang-chen Yeh","organizational control, professional autonomy, international news, editor/translator","This paper is aimed to explore the interactive relationships between the international news’ organization control and editor/translators’ professional autonomy. International desks of the newspapers in Taiwan had been supposed to be the units where organizational control exists much less, and editor/translators should have enjoyed more professional autonomy than reporters. In practice, however, editor/translators face more organizational control than reporters. The organizational control of international news comes from newspaper owners, the bureaucracy and news-making process that disadvantage editor/translators in exerting professional autonomy, leading to three kinds of interactive relationships. The authors found that editor/translators with different background performed differently in exerting professional autonomy. Senior, star and journalism/communications-educated editor/translators enjoy more autonomy than junior, non-star and non-journalism/communications-educated ones. As a whole, editor/translators enjoy reporting autonomy less than translating one. But if they want to resist organizational control, “wrap-up” reports can help.

In addition, this study found that different notions of the audience were used by the anchors to justify their news interview designs and performances. As a discursive resource, the audience was used to establish the anchor’s neutral position as well as to emphasize the independence of a journalist.

The process is known as “convergence”. However, if the industry is identified as being composed by the three sectors of production, distribution and exhibition, and then trace the movement of the capital around them, the concept of “monopoly” or “convergence” may not be the exact description of the process. After reviewing the history between 1970 and 1995 during the application of FCC’s Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (Finsyn) and Prime Time Access Rules (PTAR), this article specifically indicates that Hollywood studios have concentrated on distribution of AV products since the collapse of the “studio system”, and have treated television industry as an important exhibition channel. When the television networks tried to produce programs and challenge the studios’ position, Hollywood studios canvassed and pushed the pass of Finsyn and PTAR, which limited the capital accumulation of networks and allowed studios to dominate the syndication market. While studios kept creating and merging with the new exhibition channels in the 1980s, they were hoping to have their own networks as well.

The analytical framework consists of three agents: media, social organizations, and the nation-state. Collective memory is the result of the contestations and interactions among these agents. The result indicated that the stability of a collective memory largely depends on whether the media can effect a social imprint during the stage of event formation, whether there are social organizations dedicated to its cause, whether the media are free to report on related controversies, and whether the social political contexts provide enough discursive opportunities for the articulation of collective memory.

Niklas Luhmann’s Systemic Concept of Communication and its Application: Using the Dispute over CTV and CtiTV’s Change of Ownership as an Example,Wei-San Sun,"Autopoiesis, Communication, Luhmann, Social systems theory, Symbolically generalized media of communication","Niklas Luhmann was an enormously accomplished sociologist, whose social systems theory has significant impacts on European social sciences. However, comparing with his intellectual rival, Habermas, Luhmann certainly did not enjoy the same recognition in the English-speaking world. Likewise, Luhmann is not widely appreciated in the field of communication studies in Taiwan. This is unfortunate, especially for students of communication, since Luhmann and Habermas are the only two theorists who use communication as the basic unit in constructing social theories. This essay introduces Luhmann’s systemic concept of communication and media theory, and use the dispute over CTV and CtiTV’s change of ownership as a case study to demonstrate systems theory’s application.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1171,104,2010,Mass Communication Research

From the rhetorical perspective, this paper employs several qualitative research methods to address the interplay between corporate discourses, organizational identity, and organizational culture. Although the managerial identity works as a rhetorical vision calling members’ identification, newcomers of TBS seem to have different perceptions of the organizational context. Consequently, the multiple identity claims affect TBS’s organizational image and performance.

The Meaning of Distance in News: Hong Kong Media’s Differential Treatment of Local vs. Non-local Events,"Guo Zhongshi, To Yiu Ming, Huang Yu,, Chan Fong Yee","News distance, community newspaper, power reliance, opinion diversity, problem attribution","Geographical distance as a “natural” attribute of news has always been systematically and artificially manipulated by media workers. This study investigated how various community newspapers select, interpret, and package events originating in places of varying distances. Contextualized in Hong Kong, the paper emphasize the relationships among three sets of variables: 1) Three types of newspapers (mass appeal, elite, and pro-establishment), 2) four news locales (local, China, Asian, and international), and 3) three content characteristics (power reliance, conflicting viewpoints, and problem attribution). To test our hypotheses, this study was conducted using a large-scale content analysis of all 14 daily newspapers in Hong Kong. Findings were mixed, but showing consistently that local news was systematically differentiated from non-local news. The differences are mainly regardingthe frequency of political authorities cited, presence of diversified opinions, and the likelihood of either individuals or institutions being blamed for social wrongs. Considerable variations were detected across different types of newspapers as well. In addition, we found that the growing influence of China’s dominant ideology on the political life of Hong Kong has taken its toll on the territory’s media practice.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1167,104,2010,Mass Communication Research

Cultural Flexible Accumulation Across the Taiwan Strait in the Post-Cold War Period: The Creative Trajectory of Taiwan’s Popular Cultural Writer Chiungyao,Shao-Chun Cheng,"author position, Chiungyao, cross-strait co-production, flexible accumulation, post-Cold War era","Only after 1980s when the Cold War period ended, the popular cultural production started exchanging across the Taiwan Strait. During the post-Cold War era, Chiungyao, a popular novelist, was an influential figure. She not only had already been an established romance writer as well as film maker and TV drama producer in Taiwan, but also became the first TV producer who emboldened other Taiwan TV producers by accomplishing a historical cross-strait TV co-production project. This ambitious move opened the door of cross-strait co-productions. Through these popular cultural exchanges, Chiungyao helped to introduce Taiwanese TV culture to China’s unfledged TV industry. Chiungyao also utilized her Chinese diaspora identity to help her hometown Hunan TV industry growing into a robust player in today China’s TV landscape. Chiungyao realized how to utilize resources in the cultural industry to build her unique “author position.” This paper primarily argues that Chiungyao’s creative trajectory deserves more serious analyses, thus we will be able to learn much more about the cultural flexible accumulation practices in the post-Cold War Taiwan and China.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1179,105,2010,Mass Communication Research

Deconstructing News from Reality: A Perspective of Anti-Modernity to the Study of Journalism,Ping-Chun Liu,"anti-modernity, journalism, modernity, news, reality","This paper argues that news is a practice of reality-production in modernity. It gives contour to modernity by consistently reproducing the meaning of reality. The production and reproduction of reality (modernity) and its antithesis (anti-modernity) represent a process through which news is characterized in its historical evolution. Nevertheless, the contemporary journalism study as an academic inquiry fails to come to term with this transformation due to the fact that it positions itself within the project of modernity. This paper proposes a perspective of anti-modernity to the study of journalism to deconstruct the relationship of news to reality. It argues that the meaningful struggle of news between the (re)production of modernity (reality) and the production of anti-modernity (anti-reality) represents a dynamic process through which news should be manifested. In addition, it interprets the aesthetics of intuition in the epistemology of news of anti-modernity.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1178,105,2010,Mass Communication Research

The paper found that it is appropriate to use different concepts of time and space as methods, which connect the news story and news discourse.

The results indicated that journalism ethics was falling along with the news commercialization, and it has caused photojournalists to lose professional independence, and to sway between the identity of being the workers or the professionals. By analyzing the photojournalists’ labor process, it has been found that the professional workers’ values were merely based on the value of business interests.

The results indicated that collaborative sense-making appeared more like a communicative process than a set of fixed structure. On the other hand, the “collaborative sense-making space” could be identified to portray the forming of momentary task strategies metaphorically as the temporality of a collective state of mind.

Revisiting the Definition of “Aesthetic Responses”: Reception Aesthetics Perspective,Yu-Chai Lai,"aesthetic communication, aesthetic experience, aesthetic response, reception aesthetics","In the field of communication, the process has often been analyzed linearly and rationally by most researchers, who rarely pay attention to the emotional and non-rational elements of it. However, reception aesthetics paradigm is commonly emphasized by its aesthetic responses, which comes from the interaction of the audience’s horizon and textual structure. The audience-text relationship therefore is regarded as a “hermeneutics circle,” as indicated by Heidegger and Gadamer. In addition, the reception aesthetics perspective induces us to think about the ontology of audience, communication process, and the essence of aesthetic responses in communication studies. Such a perspective also helps us to define aesthetic communication as a dialogic process, including aesthetic horizon, text structure, interaction and aesthetic responses.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1184,106,2011,Mass Communication Research

Cheng She-wo and Chinese Anarchism,"Lu-cie Cheng, Chih-Hung Tang,, Ming-Che Lee","Cheng She-wo, Chinese anarchism, journalism history, massification","This paper attempts to discuss the influence of an ideological tradition long neglected in the study of journalism history: Chinese anarchism. A careful examination of Cheng She-wo’s social network and personal interaction normally led us to suspect the New Era anarchists may have had a greater influence on him than the liberalism of the May Fourth period. It has been noticed that most anarchists’ journalism practices concentrated in the forms of monographs, magazines, journals, and pamphlets, however, Cheng She-wo chose newspapers as the vehicle to reach the public. Cheng’s belief in the importance of public interests as the foundation for newspapers hastened his adoption of ‘massification’ as his newspapers’ direction, and his demand for massification was to engage the masses in newspapers, not to create a product solely for the consumption of the bourgeoisie. It is claimed in this paper that Chinese anarchism was not a small part to form Cheng’s journalism views and practices, especially his ideas and practices of newspapers’ ‘massification’.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1183,106,2011,Mass Communication Research

To understand the dynamic process, this paper primarily focused on the question of how the historical contexts enabled South Korea to regulate the private capitals and protect public broadcasters. According to related studies, when confronting the trend of deregulation, most countries adopted either a laissez-faire policy or an intervention one. In the South Korean case, the state has adopted the latter one. In the 1990s, facing the competition of foreign programs, South Korea introduced private capitals, yet regulating them and protecting public broadcasters. After 2000, with the arrival of foreign capitals, South Korea began to relax the control on private capitals, yet still offering the privileges to public broadcasters in new platforms.

Their transnational practices, financially supported and ideologically controlled by the state-controlled terrestrial TV stations, were confined and censored by the KMT regime’s system of governmentality in the fear of the PRC’s influence into Taiwan. The KMT state sought to incorporate the political meaning of transnational Taiwanese TV drama production to “mainland penetration”, while the transnational productions strategically negotiated with the state in order to opportunistically create better social conditions that foster transnational mobility. By symbolically positioning Taiwanese TV transnationals in the leading role of the transnational division of labor in TV drama production and representing Chinese counterparts as the technical supporters, the alliance of Taiwanese transnational cultural entrepreneurs and the terrestrial TV stations reciprocally articulated with the KMT state, reinforcing the dominant ideology of the Taiwan-China economic relations in Taiwan.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1195,107,2011,Mass Communication Research

It was believed that two factors are normally critical for the development of documentaries. One is governmental subsidies for film productions and public television, and the other one is public funding film exhibitions that support documentary circulations. Hence, the public sector becomes the most significant “employer” of local productions and turns documentary producers into its “subcontracting film workers.” However, the limitations of public funding and the blind spots of related policies have resulted in the insufficient resources for local productions and circulations. Under such circumstances, documentary producers suffer from poor working conditions, which the later part of this paper would discuss by using the results of a questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews.

The study found that Bakhtin attempted to proceed with “bottom-up” philosophy of language to address the dialectical relationship between linguistic and socio-political systems. Meanwhile, Bakhtin tried to deploy the specific “forms of language,” such as “differentiation” and “articulation,” to mobilize the deconstruction and reconstruction of meanings via the dialogic tension and antagonism.

They are also associated with stage and screen in which dramatization, humor, and romance can be represented visually. These features are used to express more diverse or subtle thoughts and emotions as well. Using the example of the exhibition Fights, Flights, and Frights INSIDE THE STORM, this paper discussed how digital games have transformed and transcended the meaning of visual aesthetics to the gamers. From the perspective of violence aesthetics, digital games have the potential to make a turn to the aesthetics of ugliness in the contemporary society.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1219,108,2011,Mass Communication Research

“Communication Failure” Phenomena in the Socialist Countries from the Perspective of Organizational Sociology: A Case Study of China and the Soviet Union,Xiang-hui Pan,"China, communication failure, socialism, Soviet Union","“Communication failure” refers to information shortage or distortion in communication caused by the structural deficits in specific social systems. It is very common in socialist systems based on the study of the history and the reality of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China. From the perspective of organizational sociology, communication failure is determined by the intrinsic structural characteristics of the socialist systems. The intrinsic structural characteristics, leading to the distortion of information communication system, include the huge party-national hierarchy system, a complex agent chain, and strict control of the power hierarchy. Being lack of independent information channels/organizations causes the problem of communication failure hard to be solved in the socialist systems. It is communication failure which is the symbiosis of the socialist systems that lead to the socialist countries into governance dilemma. Democracy and freedom of the press is the fundamental path to overcome the dilemma. Combination of the regular elections and competitive political parties and the independent media can overcome the communication failure to the fullest extent possible.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1210,108,2011,Mass Communication Research
Typography and Taiwan Consciousness:The Social Mechanism of Nationalist Imagination in the Period of Japanese Rule,Shuo-Bin Su,"imagined community, nationalism, print capitalism, Taiwan consciousness, typography","“imagined community,” together with Marshall McLuhan’s theory of “media,” the author considers that Taiwan consciousness could have been arisen with the emergence of type-print literature by analyzing texts advocating literature in the newspaper Taiwan Ming-Bao from the 1920s to the 1930s. It is argued that the abstract concept of the “Taiwan people” was first claimed because the newspaper authors were aware of the capability of typeset print and then appealed to the non-specific masses, instead of familiar friends, as their readers. At the beginning, the term “Taiwan people” to oppose the Japanese was not distinguishable from that of China. Afterwards, starting from the late 1920s, a clearer boundary between Taiwan and China was drawn in the press-sponsored literature contests. That is to say, the Taiwanese nationalism concerning the “3.6 million people of our Taiwan” took shape as an imagined community according to Anderson’s theoretical meaning. Thus, the development of typographic printing should be understood as the key mechanism to the modernist construction of Taiwan consciousness.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1233,109,2011,Mass Communication Research

The news’ frame of three public issues related to reproductive self-determination – maternal mortality rate, decriminalization of abortion, and family planning, were carefully studied. The results indicated three cultural elements of the Peruvian news frames-the importance of the nation-state, the reproduction of the traditional women’s roles, and the absence of woman as subject. While the traditional woman’s images represented in the news’ frames remained unchallenged, the increasing presence of the self-determination frame in the newspapers brought new discursive opportunities for the women’s movement. The frame competition occurs in the form of disputes on the problem definition and cause-effect deduction under the same cultural basis.

In the academic area of communication, unfortunately, studies of traveling have been long ignored. Traveling indeed has been a core communicative behavior in Taiwan and other societies. Newspapers/newsmagazines, for example, always provide extended pages on touring stories, so are traveling programs on television. While blogs became popular in the most recent decade, among the young generations in particular, writing about own traveling experience has also played a major role. The Facebook, a newly adopted communication channel may well be considered as “traveling diaries” for most users who often list down what they see and taste all in very details.

A quantitative content analysis of the prime time television news and a national survey were used to obtain public’s most important problems facing Taiwan, their television viewing patterns as well as the motivation of watching television news. The results indicated that, overall, there was no significant correlation between the television’s agenda and viewers’ agenda. However, conflict frames of issues on TV enhanced their importance among public agenda. Attention to TV news positively predicted issue divergence. The result also indicated thatpeople with information seeking motivation bear more issues than people with motivation of escape and entertainment-seeking.

To explain this rising phenomenon, the research compared four middle class protest cases that erupted in major cities (Xiamen, Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou) of China. Using the case study and in-depth interviews as the research methods, the paper argued that the new protest pattern is a dynamics of the interplay process and the result of the co-empowerment model between media and protesters. It can be further specified by two variables: one is whether an agenda enters a highly developed civil society-oriented media system, the other is whether policy entrepreneurs strategically use media framing to forge a new movement culture in the agenda. In an ever changing media environment and market condition, the co-empowerment model can be exemplified by other social movement, thus the study sheds some light in understanding the construction of the Chinese civil movement.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1229,109,2011,Mass Communication Research

This study investigated the reasons behind this progressive phenomenon. Considering the uniqueness of cross-media news consumption, this study developed a cross-media news information processing model, which was revised according to source magnification theory. This study employed a 2 (high and low news independence) x 2 (high and low news relevance) x 2 (high and low news credibility) factorial design. The results showed that perceived news information utility was the key reason. News credibility, news relevance, and news novelty were the three antecedents that affected the level of perceived information utility. These findings not only complement previous assertions made by other scholars, but also demonstrate the uniqueness of cross-media news information processing.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1245,110,2012,Mass Communication Research

Based on the examination, the review and the proposal, I advance three hypotheses about image-blending pictorial design (a metaphorical interpretation hypothesis, a cognitive hypothesis and an interpretation reversal hypothesis), and obtain experimental results that corroborate the hypotheses. Finally, implications of the present study for culture and creativity research are highlighted – the types of designs selected for the present study are pervasive and already weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life, and robustly corroborated generalizations about them give us a glimpse into the basics of cognitive regimes that support and guide cultural and creative activities.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1241,110,2012,Mass Communication Research

Information Society and Minority Groups’ Cultural Rights: The Emergence of Alternative Homeless Media in Taiwan,"Yuhui Tai, Yingching Kuo","Alternative media, citizen journalism, citizenship, digital divide, homeless, information society","This study examines the dialectic relationship between the information society and the cultural rights of minority groups. First, the digital divide and information commodification have resulted in novel forms of the suppression of minority groups. Homeless people not only suffer from political, economic, and social exclusion, but experience cultural deprivation, are demeaned as being “information poor,” and are dehumanized as stigmatized commodities. Second, the government uses household Internet accessibility as an indicator to measure the digital divide, ignoring homeless people and systematically excluding them from support policies. However, the development of information technology and the promotion of citizen journalism have lowered the barriers for minority groups to develop alternative media and have created a novel space of resistance. By examining the historical process of the emergence of homeless alternative media in Taiwan, this study argues that information technology is insufficient and that it is important to have grassroot, networked communities to help homeless people obtain information, express their opinions, and become alternative media participants. This study examines the historical context, content, format, distribution, audience responses, and obstacles of homeless alternative media and argues that homeless people’s social position must be improved to fulfill the potential of homeless alternative media.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=6,113,2012,Mass Communication Research

The Global Culture and Local Context of Online Games in Taiwan,YuPei Chang,"Globalization, online gaming, media culture, localization, culture industry","Online games are interlaced with cultural meaning, social connection, politics, and economic change. Based on a secondary data analysis of government documents, content analyses of game Web sites, and interviews with gaming companies, we describe the technological, political, and social forces that formulate the online gaming industry in Taiwan and construct a novel model to understand how the global culture of online gaming interacts with local contexts. As a global-culture industry, online gaming merges the borders of dominant and subordinate nations. Most Taiwanese game companies simultaneously localize foreign games and export self-producing games. Although game companies export online games, they focus on language localization, gamer-behavior pattern localization, and cultural customs localization.

Cold War Eyes: Reading Aborigines in Taiwan Film Culture Company Newsreels,Chin-Tong Tsai,"Aborigines, Non-fiction film, Newsreel, Scopic Regime, Taiwan Film Culture Company","Many researchers have investigated representations of aborigines in Taiwanese non-fiction film, but few have focused on Taiwan Film Culture Company newsreels from 1945 to 1983. This paper uses methods of content, frame, and narrative analysis to explore the frequency of appearance, categories, naming, and portrayals of aborigines under scopic regime of cold war eyes. The results show that Taiwanese aborigines are mostly represented without acknowledging their diversity and multiculturalism. Aborigines are interpreted on an evolutionism usually represented as primitives requiring modernization. Although aborigines are usually portrayed as primitives requiring modernization, this primitiveness is not abandoned. Aboriginal dances and clothes are treated as another type of social skin used in nationalism and tourism performances. Based on lines of sight, aborigines in the newsreels also are usually objects to be looked at. Thus, reading aborigines in Taiwan Film Culture Company newsreels manifests the meanings of de-colonization.

Understanding how digital natives use e-readers and their reading behavior are important for designing the next-generation of e-readers and mobile devices. This study explores how the introduction of e-readers into high schools influences student learning and daily activities. Because mainstream curricula are based on paper textbooks, e-readers can only play a limited role in classrooms as supplemental study aids. However, this study shows that e-readers help students to develop mobile reading habits. E-readers also encourage students to create new forms of digital content and participate in peer-sharing activities. Thus, although e-readers have not replaced traditional textbooks and curricular design, using e-readers promotes the realization of new literacies.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=21,114,2013,Mass Communication Research
Uuncovering the Hidden Ideologies of Everyday Language: van Dijk’s Analytical Strategy and its Positioning in Media Studies,Yen-Yuan Ni,"Critical discourse analysis, culture studies, ideology","This paper explores the analytical strategies and positioning of van Dijk—a scholar of contemporary critical discourse analysis. The paper uses the traceability of theoretical lineage to restore van Dijk’s layout of the interaction between discourse, cognition, and society. The paper also uses a case study to examine how van Dijk analyzed and identified a group of ideological discourse from daily language texts. This study positions the analytical strategy developed by van Dijk in a theoretical context. The results show that van Dijk’s analytical framework is applicable to various contemporary discourse theories because his analytical framework includes semantic and syntax perspectives. This linguistic perspective makes van Dijk’s analytical strategies significantly different from cultural studies. In the study of ideology, van Dijk’s analytical framework can help researchers uncover hidden ideological passwords from everyday language or formal documents.

Taiwanese Entertainment Brokerage Practices and China: An Alternative Political Economy Theoretical Framework,Shu-Fei Chang,"entertainment brokerage, field, hidden transcripts, guanxi","During the second half of 2011, the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television issued an order to reduce TV entertainment. Relevant experts expect that this will affect the Chinese broadcasting market. This order also emphasize the vulnerability and uncertainty that Taiwanese entertainment brokers face in the TV and cultural brokering fields. A significant characteristic of Chinese society is that it is ruled by law, rather than by the rule of law. This characteristic cultivates a blurred space for the competition of different powers and a space for resisting power. This study combines Western theory with Chinese concepts to develop a theoretical framework consisting of Pierre Bourdieu’s political economy perspective, James Scott’s notions of hidden transcripts, and the Chinese concept of guanxi. These concepts are used to examine invisible control in the two fields, to show how the weak use obedience and resistance in the negotiation processes and adopt disguises to maximize benefits or minimize losses, and to analyze how actors use guanxi to affect power relations in these fields.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=19,114,2013,Mass Communication Research
Mob-ility: The Social Psychological Foundation of Online Rabbling,"Arthur Hou-ming Huang, Yi-Ren Lin","ambiguity, ambivalence, collective effervescence, mobility, PTT BBS, virtual community","This paper develops a theoretical and conceptual system to grasp the interpersonal relationships on the net, which we have named “mob-ility.” One of the debates regarding interpersonal relationships on the Internet is that of the nature of virtual community. Some researchers consider the Internet to be the key to restoring the intimate, affective, and primary relationships in “estranged” modern life. In contrast, other researchers dismiss this hope and regard the anonymity, fluidity, and electivity as threatening to the community aspect of both virtual reality and real life. This is what we have termed the Community Question of virtual community, as appropriated from urban sociology. We contend that all dichotomized choices are symptoms of the inclination of thinking under the influence of scientific rationality, but miss the ambiguity and ambivalence of the postmodern culture of our era. The theory and concept of “mob-ility” attempt to transcend this dilemma and re-explore the Community Question of virtual community with new thinking for us to manifest the characteristics of Taiwanese Internet culture.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1291,115,2013,Mass Communication Research
Exploring TV News Coverage of Disaster: A Case Study of Typhoon Morakot,Chao-chen Lin,"disaster, disaster communication, disaster management, survivor, television news","On August 8, 2009, Typhoon Morakot catastrophically impacted Taiwan. As people in Taiwan closely followed this disaster, the role of the media for reporting became crucial. In this study, we employ TV news as our subject, and adopt both quantitative and qualitative methods for research. We used content analysis to analyze the major problems of disaster news coverage in TV reporting. We also broadcasted the news and conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews. The empirical research shows that, although TV news is focused on disaster management issues, it is significantly restrained by political ideologies. This study also shows that survivors are not necessarily opposed to a sad and mournful TV reporting style, they need media coverage to receive government attention. However, television media should not compete for profit by focusing on disaster coverage news while ignoring the social responsibilities of broadcasting disasters.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1288,115,2013,Mass Communication Research
The “Fictional” Counter-Hegemony — A Critique on Sin Chew Daily’s “Ethical-Cultural” Marketing Strategy (1988-2010),Teck-peng Chang,"Cultural China, “ethical-cultural” marketing strategy, hegemony, Integrity Above All, Sin Chew Daily","In this article, we examine how the 83-year-old Sin Chew Daily, a leading Malaysian Chinese newspaper that had its publication permit suspended in 1987, has created an “ethical-cultural” marketing strategy from its adverse experience, and has successfully turned into the largest Chinese media conglomerate in Malaysia. Under this marketing strategy, the discourses of “Integrity Above All” and “Cultural China” were deployed from 1988 through 2010. We find that by using the ethical-cultural marketing strategy, Sin Chew Daily has ingeniously sought to demonstrate that its survival is closely connected with the survival of the Chinese community and represents a type of antagonistic relationship between Malays (i.e., the ruling elite) and Chinese (i.e., commoners). Using this type of ethic relationship, Sin Chew Daily seems to function with the possibility of challenging the hegemony of the ruling parties, however, the “Integrity Above All” and “Cultural China” discourses have been fraught with conflict and tensions within the context of the multiethnic society of Malaysia. The discourses serve to maintain the hegemony of the ethnic-based ruling coalition, rather than act as counter-hegemony.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1290,115,2013,Mass Communication Research

This paper reviews theories, concepts, and relevant discourse concerning visual identity and the appearance of emblems, semiotics/semiology, and cultural values. Based on the review, 3 topics are considered regarding university emblems across the Taiwan Strait: (a) their exterior appearances, (b) their core values, and (c) the interrelations between the appearances and the values. The study objects are sampled from the emblems of universities established or restructured in recent years (i.e., in Taiwan since 1987 and in Mainland China since 1977), and are analyzed using content analysis and the Z test. The results show that the percentage of texts adopted by university emblems in Mainland China is 4 times higher than that in Taiwan, and that significant differences exist in the quantities of the “compliance with authority” and “worship of religious beliefs” values.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1289,115,2013,Mass Communication Research

From the actor/structure perspective, we explore how organizational restructuring limits actors’ occupational schemata individually and value consensus collectively, as well as their response to the matter. Using 7 photojournalists (as actors) serving at the local branches of 6 mainstream national newspapers (as media organizations) as our sample, we used the Zaltman method of elicitation to detail journalists’ role schemata, which comprises 6 ultimate values. Ordered from most to least important, these values were existence as a profession, preservation of news ethics, respect from others, sense of achievement, entertainment value (i.e., fun work), and artistic (i.e., personal style). This suggests that digitalization affects the way photojournalists work and their existence as a profession in the media organizations they serve. Because they are in constant struggle with media organizations (caused by digitalization), Southern Taiwan’s photojournalists adopt a work schemata of self-enhancement by enriching cultural and social capital in exchange with media organizations for economic (i.e., financial) capital.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1287,115,2013,Mass Communication Research
The Third-Person Effect: Self-serving Bias in the Processes of Downward Social Comparisons,Sue-Jen Lin,"first-person effect, presidential election, self-serving self-enhancement bias, social comparison, third-person effect","This study provides a theoretical explanation for third-person perceptual differentials and investigates how the perceived discrepancy between the impact of presidential election messages on the individual and on other people influenced voter support for media restriction in the context of the Taiwanese Presidential Election in 2012. This study proposes that the mechanism underlying the third-person perceptual disparity is a downward social comparison process that occurs when the perceivers, driven by self-enhancement bias, use the most vulnerable segments of society as the comparison anchor to form judgments of media effects on themselves and other people. An analysis of the responses from 684 voters in the 2012 Taiwan Presidential Election supports this assumption. The results showed that respondents used independent voters as comparison anchors to minimize the influence of election messages on themselves, which resulted in differences in media vulnerability among the comparison groups. In addition, a greater third-person perception was found to be associated with stronger support by voters for media self-regulation during future presidential elections.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1292,116,2013,Mass Communication Research
"Disenchantment, Enlightenment, and Empowerment: Activism and Social Influence of New Media as Alternative Communication in China",Shiou-Fen Tsai,"alternative communication, civil empowerment, civil society, new media, sociology of action","This study examines the brief development history of alternative communication in China, and then explores the development and phenomenon of new media as an alternative form of communication. The author applies the concept of “the return of an actor” from the “sociology of action” advocated by Alain Touraine to explore the following questions: (a) How can new media, as an alternative communication mode, be used and operated within the social context in China? (b) What type of communication characteristics and social significance are presented by new media? (c) How do activists of alternative communication achieve their goals, including activist motivations, strategies, and action principles, to resist the dictatorship in China? (d) What social effects could be implemented by new media as an alternative communication mode, especially for the empowerment of civil society in China? After conducting field observations in 4 cities in China and interviewing key people, the author concludes that activists of new media as an alternative communication mode have embraced the activist experience of the previous-stage alternative communication in China. Therefore, the activists of new media as an alternative communication mode are skilled in using the advantages of new media technology, such as “user friendliness,” the “time lag of control and supervision” by the government, and strategies of “relationship intimacy,” to achieve media-related social actions. These actions foster the empowerment of civil society, including civil consciousness, civil expression, and creativity, and also gradually reduce the fear of people who have been indoctrinated by propaganda and the supervision of the Chinese government.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1295,116,2013,Mass Communication Research

Based on Freud’s “beating fantasies” and Lacan’s concept of fantasy, this paper first elucidates how fantasy, with its power of fascination and the concept of the “Lacanian real,” is closely related to witnessing the pain of others in the media. Furthermore, I argue that the defensive function of fantasy allows consumers to adopt a type of mediated or inter-passive manner of viewing the suffering of others. Ultimately, the contemporary mode of witnessing (consuming) the pain of others does not necessarily cause trauma, but is constituted in the relationship between the screen of fantasy and consumers.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1294,116,2013,Mass Communication Research

However, previous studies have rarely focused on the relationship between culture and community movement. Thus, this paper considers cultural mobilization, proposes an analysis framework, and underpins the theoretical bases of culture and community movement interactions from a sociological and cultural theory perspective. Using this framework, we analyze the Wan-Bao community movement in Miaoli County to examine several research questions, including how to operate cultural resources to build effective communication among community members, and how to connect community members with cultural mobilization. Based on this case study, we explain how culture is a useful tool for community mobilization and how action is useful for community development.

To achieve this aim, this research considers home economics extension agents in Taipei County and Yilan County as examples of cultural intermediaries in modern Taiwan and conducts telephone and in-depth interviews. In the cultural economy of modern Taiwan, local cultural intermediaries can effectively introduce culinary cultural capital into rural areas. Since the 1990s, the model of regional development has gradually shifted to that of “endogenous rural development” in Taiwan. Furthermore, the social, political, and aesthetic qualities associated with local cuisine and common foods have evolved to a considerable level of importance in modern Taiwan. Because of this, cooking skills have gradually become a major interest in rural communities in Taiwan. The purpose of the research is to explore how home economics extension agents acting as local cultural intermediaries can introduce cooking skills into rural areas and reestablish traditional culinary practices while introducing new ones.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1304,117,2013,Mass Communication Research

By conducting a case study on Face News, this study discovered that the host on this program typically remains neutral by returning the discussion to a normal question-and-answer system. In addition, by reformulating other interviewers’ questions and issuing follow-up questions, this host manages to conduct confrontational interviews while still maintaining his/her neutral stance. Furthermore, by mixing casual conversations into the discussion, the host creates a friendly environment for guests and enables a political interview to be casual in nature. Finally, this study demonstrated that the host is less adversarial than other interviewers because the host tends to ask questions attributed to third parties and employ questions that are more open-ended. By contrast, the other interviewers do not hesitate to express opinions directly, ask multiple questions in succession, and ask more follow-up questions than the host does.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1306,117,2013,Mass Communication Research
Transition of Religious Media in Taiwan From the Interaction Perspective of Religion and Media,Mun-Mei Shen,"religious communication, religious media, mass media management","This article addresses the transition of religious media in Taiwan based on the interaction perspective between religion and media. This study used document analysis to explore the evolution of religious media to address the characteristics and impact of religious communication since the lifting of martial law in Taiwan. The study elucidates the shift in religious media based on the following findings: (1) Religious media are gradually becoming organized, institutionalized, and specialized, and (2) religious media organizations have acquired the dual role of media source and nonprofit organization, in which spreading religious faith is the primary objective. This implies that the relationship between religion and media is different than in the past. Therefore, religious communication can transform “media buying” into “media management” and spread religious values and philosophy through media organizations. The object of religious communication is to extend religion to the public and provide mass orientation to specific faiths. However, the people who communicate faith have changed considerably. Not only have clergies and followers of particular religions become involved in religious media organizations, but non-religious media professionals have participated as well, although for different reasons. In addition, the contents of religious communication have changed because faith-based religion has acquired social meaning.

Because of this phenomenon, the present study examined what makes novel-based films extremely appealing for viewers who have already read the novels (i.e., the knowing audience). It was discovered that curiosity regarding the novelty of the film adaptation and the desire to reexperience familiar content are the two strongest motivations that drive the knowing viewers to the movie theater. By watching such films, these viewers are able to experience multiple layers of pleasure—sensory, affective, cognitive, and reflective pleasures—caused by the intertextual and intermedial referencing and comparisons between the two formats, which is not attainable for people who watch the movie without foreknowledge of the source novel.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1310,118,2014,Mass Communication Research

Unlike other powerful totalitarian political organizations, it was a weak centralized government. Under the control of such a vulnerable regime, the newspaper publishing companies belonging to the ruling party received absolute priority in resource acquisition, for example, these companies were granted generous subsidy funds, the right to interview government personnel, and advertising resources. However, the private and commercial newspapers still had considerable space for development. Therefore, the growth and development of newspapers varied during the first decade of the Nanjing National Government. Newspapers could intervene in the government’s decisions and affect policies, this function was effective during the first ten years, which demonstrates the brilliance of scholar-run newspapers. Newspapers and journalists obtained some press freedom by engaging in difficult battles against the authorities, they employed various approaches to resist government censorship, and some people even sacrificed their lives.

"Memory Writing, Everyday Life, and Social Existence: A Case Study of Zhan Hongzhi’s Nostalgic Narrative",Shao-Chia Hu,"life story, social existence, memory, narrative, nostalgia","The core concern of this study was how personal memories are involved with the construction of social history. This paper used “memory as narrative” as a conceptual basis and developed a comprehensive framework. By appropriating narrative psychology and Martin Heidegger’s work on human beings and time, this research explored the relationships among personal memories, life stories, and social existence. According to his nostalgic narrative, Zhan Hongzhi believes that the present does not explain the past, but the past can inspire the present. He considered remembering the past as returning not only to an “emotional home,” but also to a “spiritual native land.” During that period, Taiwan was oriented toward social modernization, but the country was not yet completely controlled. The author emphasized that the simultaneity of the structural and agential dimensions between memory and temporality becomes possible only when the past and present, and agent and society are not thought of as two separate entities, which is common practice in the sociological imagination.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1312,118,2014,Mass Communication Research
Linsanity: The Media’s Representation of the Anxiety of Taiwanese Nationalism and Sports,"Ying Chiang, Tzu-Hsuan Chen","basketball, globalization, Jeremy Lin, nationalism, NBA","On February 2012, Taiwanese-American Jeremy Lin’s dramatic performance in the National Basketball Association ignited “Linsanity” across the United States and Taiwan. Delight and pride were felt among the Taiwanese. However, there was a hidden and ineffable collective national anxiety behind the phenomenon. We discuss the relationship between sports and nationalism in Taiwanese society, especially regarding how Linsanity became a vehicle for Taiwanese nationalism and its multiple implications. By adopting critical discourse analyses for reviewing stories in Taiwanese newspapers, including those from Apple Daily, The United Daily News, and The China Times published from February 5, 2012 to March 31, 2012, we discovered that, because of the country’s belated modernity and its colonial past, a Taiwanese sportsman, Jeremy Lin, became a “national hero” without “beating any foreign enemy,” and he “became one of them,” which is different from the situation in most Western societies. Moreover, “Is Jeremy Lin Taiwanese?” was the central topic of Linsanity in the discourses of the Taiwanese media, which triggered Taiwan’s diverse perspectives on identity, and the interpretation and practice of nationalism through sports / physical education.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1314,118,2014,Mass Communication Research
Professional Role Models of Journalists and Their Influence: The Case of Hong Kong,"Wang, Bess Y, Lee, Francis L.F.","Hong Kong, journalist survey, professionalism, role model","Based on the concept of role models from career studies, this research determined whether distinctive journalists influence other journalists by embodying professional ideologies. Based on the case of Hong Kong, we examined this topic by using data from surveys of journalists in 2006 and 2011, and found that respondents having professional role models tended to believe that news had strong social influences. The respondents ranked the professional functions of news to be high and liberal in political attitude. We also found that ideal journalists (role models) nominated by Hong Kong journalists were quite similar in terms of the journalistic paradigm and ideologies, despite their originating from varied societies. By contrast, ideal journalists from Mainland China represent the advocating function of journalism. We determined that the concept of the role model is applicable to studying journalists by providing initial evidence of its significance in journalism studies.

Based on actor-network theory, this study considered the user of audio guides to be both a human and a nonhuman hybrid assembly. I examined the process of how an audio guide combines narrated text with a temporal rhythm to transform the museum as a spatial ‘exhibitionary complex’. Thus, audio guides introduce a new speed politics in museum visiting. Finally, I analyzed the cultural, economic, and social capital of users employing audio guides as a mobile technology.

The Taming and Resistance Strategies of Journalists Regarding Paid news Based on Product Placement Marketing in Taiwan,"Yu-Li, Wang","journalist, paid news, product placement marketing, resistance strategy, taming strategy","In this study, we employed “in-depth interviews” to identify the taming and resistance strategies of newspaper and television journalists regarding paid news from production placement marketing projects in Taiwan. We found that news organizations frequently use four strategies that appeal to emotions, rewards, reason, and power to persuade their journalists to cover paid news from product placement marketing projects. Journalists usually pretended to be tamed by the power on the stage, then conversely tried to resist it off the stage. These journalists have used the “hidden transcript” as their resistance strategy during the stages of “receiving a product placement marketing project task,” “gathering news,” “postproduction,” “prior to news release,” “writing the news,” and “postreporting” to struggle with the conflict of covering paid news while striving to maintain professionalism.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1317,119,2014,Mass Communication Research
"More Deliberative Citizens, More Public Openness: Considering the Interrelationship Between Public Journalism and Citizen Journalism","Hu, Yuan-Hui","citizen journalism, deliberative democracy, direct democracy, public journalism, representative democracy","Public journalism, which started in the late 1980s, has lost its momentum after experiencing a period of flourishing. Citizen journalism subsequently emerged at the turn of the 21st century, and is currently being subjected to various experiments. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the relationship between public journalism and citizen journalism, and their respective implications for the democratic mechanism, by scrutinizing media theories and history. Although these two schools of journalism followed each other in chronological succession, they might not have any causal relationship between them regarding their theoretical development, but they may have a significant mutual influence. Citizen journalism, which exemplifies the essence of direct democracy, can absorb the deliberative element entailed in public journalism. Public journalism, with its deliberative spirit of democracy, can emulate the principle of openness demonstrated in citizen journalism. Thus, both schools of journalism can thrive in the contemporary news environment, and contribute actively to democracy.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1318,119,2014,Mass Communication Research
The Response of Children to the Inviting Structure of Wordless Picture books: An Example of the Aesthetic Communication of Wordless Picture books,Yu-Chai Lai,"aesthetic communication, children’s literature, imagination, inviting structure, pictorial narrative, picturebooks","In this study, we analyzed the response of audiences regarding wordless picture books from the perspective of aesthetic communication. The communication process was assessed according to the appealing structure and the interpretation process of young children. For describing an inviting structure, a narrator can use image syntax and sequence to balance the consistency and continuity of involved images. The referential system, or the context that readers associate with the roles of children’s literature, increases their enjoyment and appreciation of picture books. When viewing pictures, readers can switch between frames and pages to interpret the causal relationships that form the story. Because wordless picture books have no anchor text or specific answers, they provide young readers with room to imagine. Children must recreate the story every time they read a picture book, which enables young readers and authors to coconstruct pictorial narratives and share aesthetic experiences.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1320,119,2014,Mass Communication Research

Emerging Communities in Social Media During the 2012 Taiwanese Presidential Elections: A Big-Data Analysis Approach,"Yu-Chung Cheng, Pai-Lin Chen","Big Data, network analysis, online community, social media, Taiwanese presidential elections, Twitter","The widespread use of social media has promoted the blurring of geographical boundaries in recent years. Users from various countries can discuss events and topics that occur in any location. However, discussions of the same event or topic may still differ between communities because conformity to the global viewpoint varies based on local political and cultural backgrounds. Distinguishing the contents and modes of communication of various global social media communities is a major challenge in communication research. To address this concern, we investigated the 2012 Taiwanese presidential election. This election was both a local event and a global issue of discussion, both among Twitter users from Taiwan and in several foreign Twitter communities. We applied a Big-Data approach for analyzing the difference in the interests of different communities with respect to this election and the dynamics in their modes of communication. Local Taiwanese Twitter users engaged in heavy discussion before, during, and after the election. However, users from China mostly disclosed their concerns by retweeting and began discussing the election only once it was completed. By contrast, Japanese users “broadcasted” the news and only retweeted content published by news agencies. Thus, the results of this study indicated that the different patterns and modes of communication of social media communities that use different language codes can be identified.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1325,120,2014,Mass Communication Research

Based on a case study of Rescue Earth, this study investigated the modes by which television (TV) news reports on global warming. Oral narratives dominate TV news coverage, particularly in defining global warming as a crisis, introducing prevention strategies, and explaining scientific information. However, musical and oral narratives are usually used for amplifying the meaning conveyed by images in order to construct an image of a beautiful and pristine environment worthy of being protected. In addition, accounts of people-caused global warming are relayed through oral narratives, and black-and-white visuals are used to imply negative effects.

Changing in Convergence: The Impact of TV News Routines on the Usage of Online UGC Sources,Huei-Ling Liu,"media convergence, news routine, TV news, user-generated content","Online videos, or so called user-generated content, have been used in TV news frequently because of recent media convergence. This study examined whether this phenomenon influences news routines, and whether new characteristics of news routines have emerged because of the dependency on UGC sources. A qualitative research method was adopted, and 15 Taiwanese TV journalists were interviewed. The results show that the high dependence on the Internet for obtaining news has encouraged journalists producing news without having to leave newsroom. New routines have been formed in new production. At organizational levels, the search for online materials has been routinized, Journalist’ newsgathering and reporting are no longer original and initial but follow the hit topics on the Internet, Moreover, and news coverage currently focuses on format instead of meaning. At interorganizational level, TV news organizations monitor and imitate each other to adjust their routines.

The National Pension Act and CPF LIFE were used as examples. The research conclusion is as follows: 1. Because of democratization, Taiwanese newspapers are liberal and diverse. 2. Singaporean newspapers support the government and the ruling party’s soft authoritarian policies. 3. Taiwanese newspapers pay considerable attention to universal citizenship and human rights, and contain discourses of parties from both the left and right. However, conversation is lacking between newspapers. 4. Singaporean newspapers are enthusiastic in constructing the right antiwelfarism in emphasizing the failure of Western welfare, and in accentuating the importance of self-reliance and family responsibility. The conclusion shows that differences in discourse reflect various needs of welfare ideologies and value construction.

Historical institutionalism has been used to explain the way that Korean governments had taken to collaborate with the broadcasting industry. The relation between governments and broadcasting industry, the changes of broadcasting policies and authorities responsible for regulating TV industry are involved. Results of this study showed that strong state intervention in Korea did lead to oligopoly, and the governments dominated the industry by designing the market structure.

In Taiwan, the major “enemies” are Korea and China, two neighbor countries having close relationship with Taiwan in politics, economy, and culture fields. By both quantitative content analysis and qualitative discourse analysis of the media reports on related sport events since the 1980s, this paper examines the development and characteristics of “anti-Korea” and “anti-China” discourse. First, the amounts of both anti-Korea and anti-China discourse have increased in the globalization era of 2000s in which Taiwanese economy became in relative disadvantage to Korea and China. Moreover, the number of anti-Korea discourses is obviously more than that of anti-China through the 1980s to 2000s, while the later has increased in the 2000s as the Chinese economy grew rapidly. Second, these nationalist discourses have been transformed from “politic speech” under the governmental control in the 1980s and 1990s, to a “non-politic/entertaining sentimental performances” by ordinary people and celebrities or artists in the entertainment industry in the 2000s. Third, the so-called “festival nationalism” on Taiwanese media nationalism discourse in the globalization era mainly concentrated on anti-Korea sentiment reports, which was resulted from the competitions of the national economy and the entertainment industry among the three East Asian countries. This paper, thus, illustrates how sporting nationalism have been influenced by the economic competitions, and also demonstrates the transformation and re-construction of nationalism by the cultural economy, rather than built by political power, in the globalization age.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1550,122,2015,Mass Communication Research

It finds that structural factors of news organizations (such as orientation of the company, ownership, production model, staffing, etc.) will affect the design and operation of citizen websites. On the surface, no matter what size of company, four news organizations accord with the ideal of citizen journalism-- citizens have the right of access to media and the freedom of expression, they allow citizen journalists to publish their news without editorial review. Based on the actual operation, news organizations separate the citizen journalism from professional journalism, once entering the professional field, citizen-produced news is still edited by professional editors. Moreover, news organizations also try to use a variety of means (e.g., education training, incentives, etc.) as implicit ways to affect the performance of citizen reporters.

Media and Public Ability to Participate In Scientific Decision-making: Using Nanotechnology as A Case Study,Tsung-Jen Shih,"Nanotechnology, risk and benefit perceptions, scientific decision-making, scientific knowledge","As the paradigm of science communication transferred from a one-way, deficit model to an approach that emphasizes public participation and dialogue, citizens in the modern society have thus assumed different civic abilities. These civic abilities include basic knowledge about science, understanding of both the advantages and disadvantages of science, and the ability to make decisions regarding future development of emerging technologies. Because people rely mostly on the media for scientific information, the role of the media in cultivating civic responsibility warrants investigation. Using nanotechnology as a case study, this study aims to examine whether the media can build an informed citizenry and are helpful in people’s decision-making process. The analysis is based on a nationally representative telephone survey (N= 918). The findings indicate that attention to science news on TV has a direct and positive effect on support for nanotechnology. It also exerts an indirect effect by increasing risk perception. Attention to science news on newspapers increases the level of nano knowledge, which, in turn, heightens benefit perception and support. However, the effect of the Internet is subtler. Its effect on knowledge and support depends on education or age. The results of this study suggest that different media platforms play different roles in cultivating the necessary abilities people need in modern, scientific society. By understanding the differential role of the media, science communicators not only can choose appropriate channels for effective communication, but can develop strategies to better use the media as helpful tools in public science education.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1576,124,2015,Mass Communication Research

Instead of paying attention to the influences of the prevalence of mobile phones, this paper focuses on the ongoing accomplishment of the practices of cellphone-using. This paper contends that the mobile phone users accomplish the practices of “talking on a mobile phone” continuously by methods such as “reading hermeneutically”, “embodying”, “the documentary method of interpretation”, and “accounting reasonably”, etc. Users not only take these methods for granted, but also see but unnoticed what they really do by these cellphone-using practices. The practices identify and reproduce reflexively the structural influences brought by the prevalence of mobile phones while accomplishing the process of “talking on a mobile phone”.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1572,124,2015,Mass Communication Research

Our contention is that the quality of “instant connectivity” of mobile phones and the “ambivalence” between individual and society beneath the liquid modernity jointly bring about the phenomena which cannot be explicated by “perpetual contact”. These phenomena we attempt to investigate include the softening of time/space frameworks, the blurring of the demarcation between public and private spheres, and the fluidity of the relations between individual and society.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1573,124,2015,Mass Communication Research
Media Multitasking across Generations: Simultaneous Mobile Internet and Television Usage Behaviors and Motives,Yuhmiin Chang,"generation, media multitasking, mobile internet, motive, television, uses and gratifications","Simultaneous mobile internet and television usage has been getting very popular. Few, if any, studies explicated generational differences in this type of media multitasking behaviors. This study is the first to examine whether different generations have different behaviors and motives in the mobile internet-television media multitasking context. A national face-to-face survey with the probability proportional to size random sampling method was employed. The results showed that Web generation was most likely to perform mobile internet-television media multitasking behavior, followed by X generation and Baby Boomer generation. Web generation paid most attention to the contents on the mobile Internet, X generation focused their attention on either television or mobile internet, and Baby Boomer generation paid most attention to the contents on television. The results also showed that the motives driving mobile internet-television media multitasking behavior were the same across generations, including “habit and convenience” and “cognition and status.” All these findings supported the proposed theory of cross generation media multitasking behavior and the proposed method of analyzing the motives driving media multitasking behaviors.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1574,124,2015,Mass Communication Research

The Imagination of Communication: On Media Ecology,Chun-Hsiang Hsia,"digital convergence, media, media ecology, method, technology determinism, the imagination of communication","Following digital convergence, the press starts new adventures beyond its traditional business scope, in search for new platforms in the internet. Some extend to audio-visual journalism, others ally with radio broadcasters. As a result, conventional communication boundaries start to be blurred, and this trend is ever more intensified by touch screens of smart phones. With this in mind, this essay explores the term “media ecology” as understood in Taiwan, by juxtaposing it with some other related ideas, comparing their respective references, meantime responding to the controversy over its Chinese translations, i.e., “媒介生態學 vs. “媒介環境學”. The author concludes by suggesting a preference for the former, arguing that, if grasped as a methodological notion, it（媒介生態學）serves far better than the latter（媒介環境學）for referring to social reconfigurations and cultural impacts brought up by new media technologies. A more humanistic view of media ecology tends to focus on quality issues about civilization process. In contrast, giving a holistic description of the structural characteristics of a specific media industry could be seen as media ecology of mass media.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1582,125,2015,Mass Communication Research

How different newspapers covered those conflict events from the human rights perspective? The paper aims to analyze different news frames of 10 newspapers: 4 major Taiwan newspapers, 2 China’s major newspapers, 2 Hong Kong newspapers, New York Times of US and The Guardian in Britain. Adopting a content analysis of 7 major Xingjian riots coverage during 2013/06 to 2013/12, the research finds out that there are 2 major frames, one is the China official frame, which shows less news sources with one-sided pro-regime position, accusing the protesters, concerning less human rights abuses.

By observing the various facets of coverage on transnational migrants with different national and ethnic backgrounds in news media, the study intends to discuss how Taiwan’s society as a whole imagines foreigners coming from different regions of the world under the backdrop of increasing global migration. The study chose the online database of the four major newspapers – United Daily News, China Times, Liberty Times and Apple Daily News – as the main sources for data-gathering. News contents regarding transnational migrants within five-year time span (2007-2011) were collected, and a random sample of 466 news segments was selected for content analysis. The content analysis yields several significant findings. First, the study found that the majority of migrant news appears on local sections, and the length of coverage is mainly less than 600 words. Second, some discrepancies concerning the ways of coverage toward different groups of transnational migrants in news theme, news section, length of coverage, news tendency and news source are identified. Last, news coverage emphasizes more on the inner traits than external features when describing group characteristics of transnational migrants, which bears positive meanings for enhancing the overall images of transnational migrants.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1580,125,2015,Mass Communication Research

Place Placement: An Analysis of Local Governments’ Film Tourism Policy in Taiwan,Shu-Ling Huang,"city marketing, cultural and creative industries, film tourism, political economy, product placement","Since 2004, local governments in Taiwan have aggressively initiated the so-called film tourism policy, setting up such agencies as film commissions and filmmaking assistance center and heavily funding media production, in order to promote tourist sites in the counties or municipalities. This article adopts the approach of critical studies in communication and proposes the concept of “place placement” to analyze why such policy is an emergent form of product placement, how it is institutionalized and what impacts it has on the content and production of subsidized films. The findings show that film tourism policy, aiming at city marketing rather than developing the media industries, is a paid form of product placement. It has influenced the shooting locations, scenes, plots and characters presented in media products. Despite the benefits of financial support, it also limits free expression of artistic creativity and cultural specification of films.

What are the possible factors that have influenced cultural taste? What are significant variables related to the quality and quantity of cultural participation? And to what extent there do exist distinction and class reproduction? Data have been collected through a citywide telephone random survey and analyzed from the perspective of Pierre Bourdieu to sort out the causes and consequences of cultural participation. Statistic results show that music, movie and animation are the most popular cultural activities and they are regarded as the very cultural industries that should be fully promoted by the government as well. Cultural capital, according to regression analyses, determines the quality and quantity of cultural participation, whereas cultural participation has further demarcated the difference of class identities, reproduced existing cultural advantage, and facilitated the exchange between cultural capital and social capital. Overall speaking, the composition and volume of cultural capital and economic capital are related to the quality of cultural participation. The volume of cultural capital has positive correlation with the quantity of cultural participation. Distinction, thus, works with cultural omnivorousness side by side, and the outcomes of cultural participation in return have led to certain kinds of class identification and class reproduction.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1592,126,2016,Mass Communication Research

Those who enjoy playing the function would create virtual places. The late check-in, be not a technical restriction, may be a tactic of inviting likes. And it is also influenced by each user’s everyday life context or his/her recognition about ‘reality’. Users frequently tag people who are not with them with multiple purposes. All these demonstrate that users are sophisticated with the capture of ‘opportunities’, appropriating the Facebook ‘place’ as resources to fulfill their interests and desires, and to develop their discrete pedestrian speech acts.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1593,126,2016,Mass Communication Research

Being influenced by globalization, Japan witnessed huge transformations of lifestyles and the rise of mass media and popular culture during the interwar period. Radio was introduced to Taiwan by its ruler with great enthusiasm toward modernity. Although it was the colonizer’s intention to discipline the colonized by means of radio, the medium turned into an important source of information and entertainment for lay people.

However, most of agency works in the PTS were “long-term core jobs” rather than “temporary peripheral jobs,” and the recruitment, remuneration and benefits of agency workers were actually decided by the user enterprise, the PTS, rather than the employment agency. The agency employment in the PTS, therefore, had become the “in-house agency work” which broke the rules of related employment laws. According to the findings based on the questionnaire survey and in-depth interviews, the PTS agency workers were relatively young and high-educated, but most of them suffered from job insecurity and wage discrimination. Most interviewees were discontent with poor working conditions while highly evaluated and identified with the public interests that the PTS pursued. In 2013, the PTS agency employees established a union and urged the management for a transition to standard employment. Nevertheless, the standard employees and their union (the PTS union) spoke out against the “total transition plan,” and forced the employer laid off 6 agency workers while a total of 130 agency workers were successfully transited. The union movement of the PTS agency workers is unique for its two characteristics, including the internalization of public interests among the PTS members, and the young generation’s disobedience to the capitalism under the crisis of pauperization of work.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1618,128,2016,Mass Communication Research

A total of 544 articles from three Taiwanese business magazines were analyzed. The study found that since 2005 the establishment of corporate citizenship-related awards, three magazines began to place greater emphasis on corporate citizenship issues. As for the article themes, magazines tended to report “corporate citizenship activities and performance.” Most of magazine articles concerned CC issue of “social involvement”, and few articles focused on issue of “economic”. With respect to news frame, “business growth and glory” was the major news frame, but “moral responsibility” frame was the least. In the early period (before 2005), “contribution to society” was the major article frame, but “business growth and glory” became the major frame after 2005.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1644,130,2017,Mass Communication Research
An Analysis of Public Discourses on Taiwan Public Television at Its Initial Stage.,Chung-Jung Chiu,"civil mobilization mode, public sphere theory, Public TPV Preparation Committee, Taiwan Public Television (TPV)","Based on the public sphere theory, this article aims to analyze public discourses on Taiwan Public Television (TPV) at its initial stage. In addition, we will examine the relationship between the dilemmas TPV board faces today and normative concepts of the public sphere theory. Therefore, we refer to the theoretical framework of Habermas to propose “civil mobilization mode” to guide the discourse analysis. “Civil mobilization mode” advocates that discussing public issues should be from the “pragmatic discourses”, “interpretative discourses” to “policy discussion” and have a substantial impact on congressional legislation. After analyzing newspapers reports and the Legislative Yuan official gazettes published from 1993 to 1997, we found that there were too many discussions about political involvements of TPV. Secondly, although citizen groups brought up many “interpretative discourses”, ordinary people rarely participated in dialogues. Finally, we argue that even though citizen groups must cooperate with political parties in government agencies and the Legislative Yuan to promote “policy discussion”, they must be wary of political manipulations.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1642,130,2017,Mass Communication Research

How do media represent this issue? Does it have a difference when time has changed? This study explores the media frames and trends of news coverage of “cultural and creative industries” related stories. A framing analysis of long-term data collection focus on how newspapers have portrayed “cultural and creative industries” in the period 2002-2012. The present study found a strong emphasis on the frame of “concerning development” in early stage, and the frame of “presentinging culture” is dominant in 2011-2012. Moreover, this study also indicates the government officials are most dominant sources, and people who work in art and industries also play important roles. It became more vague and trivial in media representation when the “cultural and creative industries” issue interacted with social context during the eleven years, due to media ignoring to provide a public sphere to discuss the core value of “cultural and creative industries”.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1643,130,2017,Mass Communication Research
Narrative Communication in Digital Era: Impact from New Technologies upon Communication Industry and Academics,"Yean Tsai, Kuo-Jen Tsang","academic paradigm, digital era, narrative communication","It has been a new perspective to study communication by using alternative theories of narrative, and therefore connections among text, picture and sound are receiving greater attentions from researchers to examine communication behaviors across different media. In the meantime, the rising concept of “digital narrative” has reminded us that even the term of “narrative,” which has been well-known for its interdisciplinary characters, faces dramatic and revolutionary challenge that would force researchers to reconsider its real forms in the new age during the first era of the 21st Century. In order to explain the new challenges ahead, this study proposes the following principles which would be helpful to understand the real world after we apply narrative theories to study communication. First, narrative can be adopted to explain communication behaviors across different media. Second, both theories of narrative and communication are now fitting each other better than any time before. Third, narrative itself has turned into being a nonlinear complex system. Fourth, both reasoning and emotion are included in narrative communicative behaviors.

However, who are mobilized and how mobilization works are still unknown. This paper proposes the network opportunity model arguing that social media establish virtual proximity, which leads to information dissemination without contact and irrespective of acquaintances or unknowns. Two studies focusing on political consumerism were conducted to examine the model. Study 1 uses 2014 Taiwan Communication Survey and finds that social media diversify the participant of social movement. Study 2 uses Web survey and shows that repeated exposure to similar topic on social media elevates the opportunity of observational learning. Based on social cognitive theory, the increase in observational learning cultivates self-efficacy and promotes social movement participation.

Second, citizen journalism platforms not only empower women, but also restrict them. Women still face the problems of female reporters, such as the appearance, size, femininity, even gendered division of household labor.

The research mainly looks at local journalism from 1950 to 2014, in which the alteration of the use of words and topics related to animals are displayed, and selects reports representative of such vicissitudes as subjects of narrative analysis. Our results show that the narrative strategy of the animal issues in newspapers gradually turned toward the invocation of more complicated emotions. Moreover, with the growing attention that Taiwanese society pays to animal issues, the emotionalized strategy of communication also stimulates the cohesion of public consensus on such issues. As substantiated by the industrial and epidemic domains of animal-related narratives, where the security of human society still surpasses the ethical care for animals, animals of discrete species provoke either anxiety or sympathy, thus manifesting a differentiated emotionalized tendency.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1657,133,2017,Mass Communication Research

The essay reviews LIFE magazine, from which a certain set of professional conventions in Western photojournalism was “invented”, and explains how it has shaped and encouraged the practices in WPP. The essay argues that award-winning photographic images in this category of WPP from all over the world, particularly those from non-Western areas, have transformed daily lives into cultural/visual spectacles through the contents selected, special angles/visual styles taken, or anticipated readers of the works. Due to the WPP’s immense power in media and culture, this paper further contends that photojournalists from non-Western countries internalize such approaches exercised by Western photographers and jury members, and eventually self-exoticize the daily lives in their own societies.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1658,133,2017,Mass Communication Research

As the first and third person effects of media messages may influence audiences’ behavior, this study fills the gap in the literature concerning third-person effect by examining different levels and exploring the perceived effects of global warming at both the individual and national levels. Results from a national survey in Taiwan (n = 1,074) reveal differential self-other perceptual disparities at these two levels. While the first-person effect is observed at the individual level, the third-person effect is observed at the national level. The first-person perception at the individual level positively predicts audiences’ willingness to take proactive environmental action, but the third-person perception at the national level negatively predicts audiences’ willingness to take promotional and proactive environmental actions. The findings suggest that more news coverage on mitigation policies and emission reduction activities at various sectors and levels may increase audiences’ awareness to the phenomenon of climate change and encourage their engagement in pro-environmental behavior.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1664,134,2018,Mass Communication Research

To understand the relevance of gender identity and characterization of female gamers in Massive Multiplayer Online Games, this paper divides gender identity into two parts: sexual orientation and gender role, and separates characterization into three parts: gender, class, and appearance. The results show the following. In gender identity, most female gamers are attracted to men. In gender role, female gamers must gradually shed gender stereotypes. This paper also finds that female gamers turn gender stereotypes upside down concerning toys, jobs, housework, and leadership. In characterization, female gamers tend to create female roles, tend to choose wizard and archer as an occupation, and create roles that have light skin and exude confidence.

Hong Kong is situated on the frontline and has experienced many kinds of challenges. Due to its value of representativeness around the region, I analyze the changing ownership of ATV and TVB from 1997 to 2017 as well as the controversy of issuing new terrestrial TV licenses in 2009. To symptomatically understand Hong Kong, one must put it in the historical context, especially its dialectical relationship with China.

Second, I dissect the political thinking of the CCP leadership, which provides the background of the Go Global policy and China Dream proclamation. Third, I investigate the relationship between financial capital and the Go Global policy. The research finding shows that clientelism with Chinese characteristics has penetrated into HK. Capitalists from China, HK, and Taiwan work together during M&A activities and use capital instruments to circumvent legislation supervision. Moreover, the role of Chinese bureaucratic capitalists has become apparent after obtaining immunity from the Chief Executive. The complicity of clientele politics, the evasion of legal sanctions, and a deregulation policy that has allowed non-citizens run local media as proposed by the current Chief Executive have demonstrated the deepening crisis of legal governance in Hong Kong and the erosion of democratic principles.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1669,135,2018,Mass Communication Research

This essay examines the phenomenon and its relationship between sport and nationalistic implications in Taiwanese society. Methodologically, the essay adopts critical discourse analyses to review stories and commentaries in Taiwanese newspapers and to critically examine the media’s representation of the migration. Because of the unique political situation between China and Taiwan, the economic impacts of the migration still fuel Taiwanese nationalistic implications and make its discourse ever-changing. With the labor migration of Taiwanese basketball talents, the media just focuses on their on-court performance and salary. In order to avoid awkwardness and tension under such circumstances, the formula for the mediated construction of Taiwan’s glory does not apply to these basketball migrants amid political tussles and tacit agreements between the two sides of Taiwan Strait. The result shows that Taiwan’s “postmodern nation” exhibits characteristics of national identification in Taiwan society, but national identity from media representation still reveals differences between Taiwan and China, which trigger further reflections on the environment of sport development that depends more and more on China.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1671,135,2018,Mass Communication Research

First, it explains why and how Bakhtin contradictorily evaluated the dialogicity of Dostoevsky’s polyphonic novel, especially the failure to model the so-called ideal speech situation. Herein, the standpoints of “from the self to the social” and “from time to space” might serve as the rhetorical resources for Bakhtin’s turn to Goethe during the later period. Second, it outlines the two revolving rings of spatiality in Bildungsroman, which proceed from “recollecting the past” to “foreseeing the future” on the basis of visuality and “vision of emergence.” Therefore, Bakhtin has temporarily been substituting his previous research concern on polyphonic novel with spatial rhetoric, which sets up the rhetorical agency in phases. Based on the research findings, this paper argues that the importance of Bakhtin’s embodied spatial rhetoric is indeed its subscription to the primacy of resistance and rhetorical practice over dialogue.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1678,136,2018,Mass Communication Research

Based on this view and utilizing social drama to view communist espionage news as media rituals affecting social orders, this article analyzes communist espionage news that appeared in Central Daily and News Weekly in the early 1950s, looking at how and from what angles communist espionage was framed. From those news articles, this article finds that communist spies were not only regarded as traitors, but also judged through the lense of traditional ethical values and differentiated as enemies by a simplified binary method of good and evil. The government legitimatized the anti-communism advocacy and led the citizenry to be fearful of and alienated from communist spies. The ambience of horror and depression became unerasable collective memories and nightmares of the people of that era, thus hindering later generations from recognizing the historical truth and expecting the possibility of a different future.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1676,136,2018,Mass Communication Research

At first, “癡呆” was only a common expression, but then it developed into an illness name and even a curse word. Moreover, with special writing rules specific for journalism, these news reports reinforced dementia’s negative stereotypes as a shameful and disgraceful illness.

Preliminary Exploration of Constructing a Fantasy Transmedia Story Network Using Narrative Strategies: Using the Story Network of the Harry Potter Series as an Example,Yu-Chai Lai,"intermediality, fantasy genre, story network, narrative strategy, transmedia storytelling","This study used the Harry Potter series to analyze the application of intermediality for constructing story nodes and textual constellations and for encouraging continual interaction from the implicit audience. In contrast to the static observation of traditional structuralism, the story network of the Harry Potter series constantly expands and flows. By tracing the implicit audience’s transmedia memory, the narrator arranges multiplatform story landmarks to bring the audience into the network through their wandering perspectives. In addition, the narrator applies extra compositional intermediality and thereby invites the audience into the story network by referring to other literary works. Finally, in the Harry Potter series, network aesthetics are embodied through the occasional insertion of additional plotlines into the story network, which compels the implicit audience to travel between multiplatform story nodes and to compare episodes in order to fill the gaps.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1684,137,2018,Mass Communication Research

"Identity, Gangsters’ Narrative, and Image of Taiwan Politicians: Representations of Taiwan Politics in Hong Kong Cinema",Yen-Yuan Ni,"representation, Hong Kong cinema, Taiwan politics","This study explores the discourse and narrative structure of three films from Hong Kong based on their representation of Taiwanese politics. Among contemporary Chinese films, those that directly use Taiwan’s politics or political figures as their narrative focus make up a rare genre, especially as film productions produced in Taiwan are close to nil. However, the Hong Kong film industry has successively produced several films on the subject of Taiwan’s politics or political figures, constructing a rather unique representation of “Taiwan’s politics” with Hong Kong people’s perspective as the main subject. Therefore, this study examines Taiwan’s politics presented or framed in related film texts through several cultural and political perspectives. This paper finds that “Taiwan’s political imagery” as represented by the three films has a one-sided focus on organized crime, corruption, power games, behind-the-scenes trading, power manipulation, violence, assassinations, and other negative aspects. All three films used Taiwan as a form of a mirror in order to strengthen the Hong Kong people’s own identity. Most of the actors playing Taiwanese politicians in the three films are Hong Kong celebrities, while local Taiwanese actors typically have just supporting roles. At the same time, all three films choose gang narratives to start the story, making triads and gangs of the underworld the main narrative structures of Hong Kong screenwriters’ and directors’ description of Taiwan’s politics.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=1683,137,2018,Mass Communication Research

This paper argues that a high risk population of climate disaster suffers from both social vulnerability and digital poverty, and therefore it is difficult for the Internet to become the most effective source of disaster risk information. Using the 2016 Taiwan Communication Survey, the data analysis shows that vulnerable people in Taiwan rely much more on TV rather than on the Internet to access disaster information for typhoons and floods, because of their digital poverty.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1569224784592,138,2019,Mass Communication Research

The news media samples include three major newspapers in Taiwan (Apple Daily, United Daily, and Liberty Times) and four internet-based news outlets (New Talk, Independent Comments of Commonwealth, News Lens, and Storm Media). We conduct a computerized content analysis, which unlike a traditional content analysis, allows us to more objectively deal with a large amount of content. Using this method, we studied posts and comments related to the gas explosions in terms of their volume and content (i.e., topics, positive and negative emotions, and cognitive processing). We find that these posts and comments paid more attention to the cognitive aspect of the disaster than to positive and negative emotions. Further, while both the media and audience paid close attention to the government’s disaster management, in contrast with the news media, the audience’s cognitive processing diminished over time and thus, related knowledge could not be accumulated. This study also examines the impact of media posts on Facebook fans’ comments while controlling for time sequence in a natural environment, which is similar to a quasi-experiment, and doing so improved both external and internal validities.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1569224963645,138,2019,Mass Communication Research
The Birth of “Vicious” TV: Re-examining the Early Stage of the Development of Taiwanese Cable Television (1980-1993),Ti Wei,"cable television, communication policy, the fourth channel, media disorder","“The fourth channel”, regarded as Taiwanese cable television’s predecessor, appeared in the 1970s and rapidly expanded in the 1980s. After formal legislation in 1993, cable television not only became Taiwan’s most important form of televized broadcasting services, but is also considered as the main cause for nearly two decades of Taiwan’s “media disorder”. This article re-examines the political and social environments and industrial state of “the fourth channel” between 1980 and 1993, in order to more accurately explain why cable television evolved into a key problem of Taiwanese media, using document analysis, news text analysis, and audience in-depth interviews to explore the issue in three aspects. First, contradictory state policies and unfriendly mainstream discourse together established the early stages of development. Second, the interplay of these two conditions forced “the fourth channel” industry to evolve into a small- to medium-sized enterprise model and the corresponding operational practices, which were sustained after the legistation period. Third, at that time the general audience had no concrete and strong needs nor imagination for alternative televized services, but their consumption trend was gradually shaped by the service provided by “the fourth channel”. Along with the state and the industry, it then helped stabilize the later characteristics of Taiwanese cable television service.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1559543510510,139,2019,Mass Communication Research

Regarding Li Shuangze as the leading figure of the “Singing out Our Songs” movement, we argue that the act of his creation deploys the very way of answering the social condition as well as the urgent issue of identification at that time.

Based on Johann Gottlieb Fichte’s value philosophy about scholars’ mission and a historical view of communication discipline, this paper analyzes the puzzles and difficulties for self-fulfillments that communication scholars may confront when choosing the communication discipline as their major. We first begin by solving the communication ontology puzzle and then integrate the positive and clear self-understanding and self-reflection consciousness into the ontological construction of communication knowledge.

The writing principles of the article of multimodal discourse: On the theory of Husserl’s intentionality and horizons,Ming-Che Lee,"composition, horizons, Husserl, life world, multimodal discourse","This paper focuses on the relationship between the writing of multimodal discourse articles and the use of the principles of composition by emphasizing that the image is equal to the word in the articles of multimodal discourse. Thus, this research is different from traditional articles that only use the image or the word to present the meaning of the articles. Based on such a fact, we propose that using the principles of composition is the key factor for giving the article of multimodal discourse the function of communicating the meaning to the audience. This paper uses Husserl’s theory of ‘intentionality’ and ‘horizons’ to discuss the above issues and argues when the author correctly uses the principles of composition and writing to write a multimodal discourse article that the article could become a media article, which means that the whole audience could achieve the same meaning from the same multimodal discourse article.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1566208978140,140,2019,Mass Communication Research
Political Discourses in Taipei City’s Urban Revival Plans: Symbolic Hegemony in Formation,Shiaw-Chian Fong,"conceptual metaphor, Gramscian hegemony, political discourse, revival plan, Taipei City","The Taipei City Government proposed “Vision 2050 of Taipei” in 2015 as a long-term urban revival plan. It thus raises a critical question: How will it be fine-tuned to gear with citizens’ changing needs? To answer this question, we apply the notions of political discourse and Gramscian hegemony and analyze the three district-level revival sub-plans of “Vision 2050”. By reducing the government’s persuasion and citizens’ responses to the analytical relations among value, goal, circumstance, means, and action claim (categories taken from the political discourse literature), we find that citizens on the whole will rally round the government’s plans, even if these plans suffer from elaborating upon their own values, goals, and action claims. They will positively endorse these plans, primarily because they share with the officials the same conceptual metaphor, i.e., to enrich the people, which becomes the fundamental consensus between the rulers and the ruled. Not all citizens, however, sing the same tune. Those community workers among them do have an alternative plan that focuses exclusively on the value, the goal, and the means for preserving the urban historical heritages. Their plan constitutes a breach of the otherwise completely closed discourse of the government. It therefore prevents the government’s agenda from realizing a sweeping Gramscian hegemony.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1566210033953,140,2019,Mass Communication Research

"Empowerment and its limits? Postfeminism, social media, and selfies",Tingyu Kang,"social media, postfeminism, selfie, gender, sexualization","This study examines women’s sexualization of the self on social media in the context of postfeminist media culture. Postfeminist media culture refers to an emerging trend of sexualizing women. In postfeminist media culture, sexy bodies are portrayed as a site where women actively explore their sexual subjectivities, gain autonomy, and develop sexual confidence. Many debates have since centered on to what extent this trend of postfeminist media culture can be identified as sexual empowerment and agency. While the current debates on postfeminist media culture largely focus on mass media, it is now also a prominent phenomenon on social media, particularly in the form of selfies. This study is based on semi-structured interviews with women who have participated in the production of sexy selfies, exploring whether or not these experiences empower women with regard to sexual autonomy, sexual subjectivity, and sexual self-esteem. The findings demonstrate that these female users of social media develop binary distinctions in understanding sexual subjects in order to negotiate male gaze on their selfies. This includes local / western, male gaze / female autonomy, and oppressive gaze / resisting bodies. On the one hand, these women develop these binary distinctions to identify themselves as having a westernized, liberated, autonomous bodily style that challenges the local, male-dominated definition of sexiness. On the other hand, this articulation of liberation and sexual autonomy requires them to conform to the logics of capital in western-centric consumerism and reproduces the hierarchy between western and local cultures.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1571576953955,141,2019,Mass Communication Research
The role of ‘others’ in the self-narrative and memory construction on social network sites: a case study of Facebook parenting stories,Yow-Jiun Wang,"autobiographical memory, digital memory, imagined audience, narrative memory, self-narrative, social network site","Autobiographical memories that define self-concept are often configured in self-narratives that take place through social interactions or take the form of literary genres. Providing interactive and narrative spaces, Facebook as a social network site not only serves to elicit and inscribe memories, but also changes the relationships between narrators and their interactive others. Via multiple case studies, this paper focuses on the topic of parent-child memories, investigating how multiple others, including proximate/significant other, subject Other, coaxer, addressee, and imagined and real audience, are involved in personal narrative memories on Facebook. This research finds that the interviewees tend to fit in with the common culture of Facebook and script their posts about parent-child lives as happy short stories. The coaxers in the cases are the narrators themselves, who want to record precious memories or adapt to life situations. Against various subject Others, the interviewees construct the narrated “I”s. The feedback mechanisms of Facebook allow the interviewees to perceive audiences’responses, thus enhancing their motivations for posting and sharing memories. Playing collaborative coaxers, the audiences act as the agents of social accountability, affecting the interviewees’ narrative strategies and their methods of selecting and organizing memories. Comparing with the usual imagined and real audiences, the addressees’ perspectives and responses are more influential. Self-censorships based on others’ gaze are related to self- gaze. Owing to its interactive mechanisms and observable cultural patterns, Facebook accommodates the interplays between others’ gaze and self-gaze implicated in the continuous micro-memory narratives on the platform.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1571576800505,141,2019,Mass Communication Research

This study attempts to conduct some critical adjustment to the “audience” theory through the outstanding case of BS video, in order to explore the newly created term “Joyduser”, which infers to the audience’s character being turned into a group of people who are both “producer” and “user”, whereby seeking pleasure is their main purpose for watching videos on the Internet.

“Social-network-manager” journalism: The impacts of social media and messaging apps on the journalistic profession,Chang-de Liu,"new technologies, social media managers, objectivity, social network marketing, affective interactions","The rapid growth of social media and messaging apps has changed how people access information and how journalists report news. In order to analyze the impact of new social network technologies on journalism, this research conducts quantitative content analysis on a total of 16,900 news reports and social network media posts by six Taiwanese news organizations and processes quantitative semi-structured interviews with 11 journalists who manage Facebook fan pages and official LINE accounts. First, the results of content analysis demonstrate that the usages of “non-hard news” and “emotional or interactional headlines” on social media and messaging apps are significantly higher than that on websites. Furthermore, the preferences of non-traditional news value posts on Facebook and LINE are general among the various news media, including newspapers, televisions, and online media. Second, the results of in-depth interviews reveal that the most important principle for social media managers to choose posts and produce headlines is “forward-referring” by which users are motivated to click hyperlinks and read news stories. Objectivity, the core concept of traditional journalism, is challenged by social media managers who usually emotionally express their attitudes on non-public issues and interact intimately with their audiences. The research concludes that this emerging journalistic profession, which is different from traditional journalism and reshaped by social media and messaging apps, emphasizes on affective interactions, de-politicization, and marketing orientation.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1579771356981,142,2020,Mass Communication Research

Social interaction can actually empower the elderly to reach this status. This study examines social interaction building among aging people who play mobile games with an augmented function. The qualitative research methods adopted are in-depth interviews, focus groups, and field research spanning six months. Sixteen aging people accepted our invite for an interview. The research questions are divided into “Gaming behavior”, “Social interaction”, and “Life re-thinking”. The results reveal the following. First, leisure capital is needed in order to maintain the social interaction built up through mobile game playing by aging people. It is not achieved suddenly, but rather through personal investment. Second, aging people are unfamiliar with the Internet and find it hard to trust others easily, however, augmented reality games can combine exercising with fun, so that the elderly can play games with their friends at the same place and same time in a sort of social ritual. In this way, aging people not only consolidate relationships with acquaintances, but have the possibility of getting to know strangers through regular face-to-face encounters. Third, games blur the generation gap and social class boundaries. Games also help consolidate older adults’ original interpersonal relationships and assist them at broadening new interpersonal ties with others. If social welfare policy wants to set up a suitable leisure activity for the elderly in the future, then our findings suggest that the concept of cultivating mutual interests without age barriers can help aging people to build relationships with others and embark on the road to successful aging.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1588133415355,143,2020,Mass Communication Research
Pilot Study of Transtext Based on the Audience’s Interpretation of Transmedia Characters: Using Classical Fairy Tale Characters as Examples,Yu-Chai Lai,"Intermediality, story network, transmedia character, transmedia storytelling, transtexts","Transmedia adaptation industry initiatives combined with transtext have triggered growing discussions in the literature as well as have become quite popular online. Such adaptations enable virtual characters to fit in with an audience’s ownlife context. Thus, this study uses classical fairy tale transmedia characters and transtext as the basis to explore the audience’s interpretation of the cross-platform reconstruction process of such characters. An audience uses transmedia character memories as the context and cornerstone to understand character transformation. The primary imagination (sensual associations and empathy) is triggered by transtext, and audiences may even recreate transtext or images, rewrite descriptions of classical characters, or reconstruct the story network through their own secondary imagination. The audience compares classical characters and transtext from multiple platforms in order to fill gaps in the extended texts. For example, the vivid presentation of live-action remake movies is based on literature and historical information as references in order to mitigate the gap between the audience and virtual characters. The audience can also trigger negativity from transtext. Negativity involves the audience’s reflection on the fairy tale genre, the contemplation of adapters’ narrative strategies of transtext material selection in reshaping classical characters, and the deliberation of the supplementary and dialectical relationships of transtext. For example, images of stars, actors, and actresses (transtext such as news) are conducive to reversing the existing cognition of the audience and adding new meanings in the characters. Overall, transmedia industries have attracted intergenerational audiences through various genres and have also integrated nonvirtual information of transtext so as to facilitate the expansion of potential clientele from multiple aspects. These industries apply strategies including transtext information to entice the audience to be engaged in the character systems of the stories with the aim of consolidating the story network of transmedia characters.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1588133644299,143,2020,Mass Communication Research
Integration of the Differential Gains Model and Cross Pressure: The Case of the 2018 Mayoral Elections in Chiayi County and Chiayi City,"Yun-Ching Tsai, Song-In Wang","cross pressure, differential gains model, political discussion, political participation, willingness to vote","Active political discussion is one of the motives for crafting a mature democracy. Previous studies have tested the differential gains model to explain the complexity of political engagement in face-to–face conversations, traditional mass media, and online interactions, presenting research results in which offline and computer-mediated interpersonal communication, such as online chatting, moderates the effects of political news on political participation. The term “cross-pressure” is utilized in studies of political behavior to refer to an individual’s experience of conflicting (rather than reinforcing) influences across a range of salient considerations. Early studies found that cross-pressured citizens are less enthusiastic about politics, more uncertain about their vote preferences, and less likely to participating in voting than those citizens subject to reinforcing political influences. The present study examines the interactional effects of media use and political discussions on voters’ political participation and willingness to vote by adopting the differential gains model and cross pressure theory during the 2018 mayoral elections in Chiayi County and Chiayi City. A telephone survey was conducted one month before the Election Day, in which 534 and 543 random samples were collected in Chiayi County and Chiayi City, respectively. The results showed that the interaction between online media use and interpersonal political discussion significantly predicts political participation both in Chiayi County and Chiayi City, whereas the interaction between traditional media use and interpersonal political discussion significantly predicts willingness to vote both in Chiayi County and Chiayi City. In addition, the moderating effect of interpersonal cross-pressure is significant in Chiayi City, but not in Chiayi County. This paper also discusses implications and recommendations for future research.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1588133830968,143,2020,Mass Communication Research
The Heterogeneous Actor-Network of Social Media Research: Reimaging the Production of Knowledge in the Digital Age,Chia- Rong Tsao,"digital humanities, digital sociology, digital tools, hybrid network, posthuman, social media studies","This research examines the interdisciplinary practices and collaborations of the social media literature from the perspective of the new materialism. Big data and related digital tools are changing the format of knowledge production among the humanities and social sciences. Moreover, the development of digital sociology and digital humanities shows the clear trend of collaboration between social scientists (or humanists), data scientists, and digital tools. A reflection of this kind of interdisciplinary research focuses mainly on the problem of methods and methodology, but some works also probe epistemological questions. This research instead explores the practices and collaborative processes of knowledge production that involve the interaction between social scientists (or humanists), data scientists, and digital tools. Based on the new materialism, the process is seen as a network assembled by heterogeneous elements including both humans and non-humans. We thus discuss how an interdisciplinary research team is enacted, how researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds collaborate with each other, and how digital tools as non-human actors act and interact with researchers? The discussion is based on two cases of social media research teams in Taiwan. In the end, we argue that, before judging the digital tool, no matter as “a favor” or as “a burden”, one must reconsider the whole process of knowledge production by treating it as a hybrid network assembled by heterogeneous activities. In this way, we are able to know more about the relationships among different “actors” and what they actually do, hence making the knowledge production of this digital era even more solid.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1588134076295,143,2020,Mass Communication Research
To Be Or Not To Be? The Media Tragedy of Attentional Commons on Facebook,"Victoria Y. Chen, Tse-min Lin","Facebook, journalism, news content, social media, the tragedy of the commons","The fact that news media distribute their content on Facebook in order to reach more readers and to gain more traffic back to their websites sets up a dilemma. This paper adopts the concept of the tragedy of the commons to explain why news media are aware of the concern of losing control over their content and their business, but still choose to stay on and to utilize Facebook.This paper further explores the strategies that news media adopt when facing this dilemma and investigates possible solutions to the tragedy of attentional commons on Facebook. The results herein show that the Facebook dilemma conforms to the hypothesis of the tragedy of the commons. News media are indeed willing to take the risk to partner with Facebook, because the benefit from providing free content to Facebook outweighs the cost of doing so in the short run, but not necessarily in the long run. For news publishers, sustainability is a much more pressing issue than thinking of a strategy very far out into the future. This paper argues that news publishers ignore the externality of partnering with Facebook, and that the price news publishers are likely to pay covers the loss of news and economic autonomy, because when they build their business on Facebook, if Facebook changes its rules, then these news publishers need to change accordingly. In a sense, Facebook has the power to influence news content. Two contradictions arise from the tragedy of attentional commons on Facebook. 1) News media cultivate their independence from Facebook by investing into more content and interaction with users on Facebook. 2) Producing news that only conforms to Facebook users’ interests based on an opaque algorithm fails to override something that is important but not popular among users. Overall, under the tragedy of attentional commons on Facebook, news media and consumers are paying the price, because Facebook is the only beneficiary.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1596102227948,144,2020,Mass Communication Research
Decision-making Process in Quitting Journalism - A Study on the Resignation of Journalists in the Digital Era,Huei-Ling Liu,"burnout, image violation, shock event, voluntary turnover","In order to explore the decision-making process of journalists when quitting their journalistic job, 20 newspaper and TV journalists who left the press industry after 2013 were interviewed based on the unfolding model of voluntary employee turnover. This study shows that the main factors spurring reporters to consider quitting are burnout triggered by digital working conditions and the image violation caused by conflicts between different professional roles. The term “image violation” refers to the conflicting mental status triggered by one’s inability to achieve personal value, goal and strategy at work, and also takes on the role of helping journalists to introspectively examine themselves during the process of making a final decision. According to the data collected, the total time spent from the preliminary idea of quitting to actually making the decision to quit varies. All the research objects experienced push and pull factors in their minds during this period. Their enthusiasm for journalism, concern over a lack of expertise, and financial burden were the major obstacles to resignation. The social status of journalists not being as respectable as before, job insecurity, and limited salary growth were the motives for leaving a journalistic job. Before the final decision was made, this study also finds that everyone encountered a certain type of shock event and the digital policies and leadership at the media firm for which they worked were two examples that most of the research objects were ever faced with. The findings hence support the assumption of the unfolding model that asserts a shock event is an important factor stimulating one’s attempt to quit a job. This research further suggests that the impact of a shock event on decision-making does not necessarily occur in the early stage of the whole process. It does, however, seem to play a significant role in accelerating journalists’ determination to part with the industry of journalism.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1596102310471,144,2020,Mass Communication Research
Turning from the “Object” into the “Subject”: A Case Study of the Baiku Yao Community Media Team,Chin-Tong Tsai,"documentary, ethnographic film, participatory video, reflexivity, subjectivity","So-called “new Chinese documentaries” have received a lot of attention in the media and film study recently, but there is another important but ignored film movement in the southwest frontier of China. It is named community media, and its education comes from the concept of participatory video. Through some form of educational process, the documentaries’ facilitators hand over the power of the camera to voiceless people and empower them to speak in their own voices and to see the world from their own eyes. Therefore, via field investigations, participant observations, and in- depth interviews, this paper explores how community media and its education in southwest frontier China, especially taking the Baiku Yao community media team in Guangxi for example, not only generates subjectivity, but also produces reflexivity on documentary or ethnographic film. This paper concludes that community media and its education particularly emphasizes the cultural production based on community or ethnic group involved with the relationship of shooting, the aesthetics of text, and the politics of screening. First, community media and its education changes the relationship between shooting and expands possibilities such as collaborative, inherited, or practical. Second, although community media and its education focuses on environmental protection and traditional culture as the main topics, observations of social change and visual power also appear. Moreover, under the aesthetics of text, they develop an archiving way and vertical method to represent reality. Third, the previous negative viewpoint of Baiku Yao people on camera has changed, as they have now learned to recognize the value of documentary or ethnographic film, especially related to the collective memory of a community or ethnic group.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1596102372060,144,2020,Mass Communication Research
A Meta-Research of Media Management and Economics: 1988-2016,J. Sonia Huang,"international journals, media economics, media management, meta-research","Media scholars have largely ignored or intentionally avoided the effects of economic forces, but things have change dramatically over the past few decades. With the emergence of information and communication technologies, greater media globalization, and the changing behavior of audiences, a specific application of economic and managerial laws and theories upon media industries and firms becomes increasingly more crucial. Meta-research focuses on a synoptic analysis concerning research in media management and economics, by pointing out its current state as well as future areas of research. This study reviewed 842 articles from three core international journals - namely, Journal of Media Economics, The International Journal on Media Management, and Journal of Media Business Studies - spanning from 1988 to 2016 according to the year of publication, background of author(s), industry studied, theoretical base, research methods, and data analytics. The main results show that: (a) the demand for media management and economics research has gone up annually ever since the year 2000, (b) author concentration has almost disappeared, but more than 40% of first authors are from the Unites States, (c) the research on traditional media is still the majority, but studies of information and Internet industries and studies of other issues have increased year by year, (d) the volume of media management research is greater than that of media economics research and growing over time, and (e) non-empirical qualitative studies account for a considerable amount overall, but exhibit a downward trend. The conclusion summarizes the research results and derives future trends of media management and economics.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1596102513583,144,2020,Mass Communication Research
Clouds Deep in the Sea: The Infrastructural Inquiry of the Internet,Shih-che Tang,"infrastructure, Internet, media, submarine cable, system","Society as an organic system has taken root in the spatial expansion of transportation and communication media. In the light of this materialistic epistemology, the article presents the infrastructural dimensions of the Internet as a communication system, unfolding a discussion with the affinity of the system as a concept with the development of modern transportation and communication networks. From canals, to railways, to radio masts and submarine cable lines, the physical layout of modern transportation and communication infrastructure has, at different times, inspired various thoughts of society as an organic system. The article proposes to use infrastructure as a conceptual entry point to explore the Internet as a communication system. By way of Geoffrey Bowker and Leigh Star’s characterization of infrastructure, the article singles out cable as a crucial boundary object with social and geo-political implications: Socially, the Internet as a technology of connectivity has been a work of collaboration since its incubation stage. Via wired computers under a unified communication protocol, this network technology at the seminal stage underwent a process of social integration, linking diverse communities of practice with heterogeneous interests in national defense, science, and business. Therefore, the Internet fully manifested itself as a socio-technical system. The boundary character of the Internet is also apparent in the transoceanic connection of the submarine cable. Geo-politically, this cable has been, and still is, the acting agent of surveillance systems on a global scale. The risk of disconnection reflects the ongoing conflict and struggle among international political power blocs. In addition, high-tech corridors and zones benefitting from the transoceanic cable linkage substantiate the logic of accumulation through the dispossession characteristic of digital capitalism.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1604040772941,145,2020,Mass Communication Research
“Collaborative Mobility” in Urban Space: WeMo Scooter as an Example,Yi-Fan Liu,"collaborative mobility, scooter-sharing system, smartphone, practices, WeMo Scooter","Scooter-sharing is becoming more and more popular in Taiwan, making the country the second-ranked market by size globally. Inspired by software studies, this study defines a scooter-sharing system as “collaborative mobility” that connects smartphones and electric scooters and makes them work together. Therefore, it operates through media practice and movement practice simultaneously, which are inseparable. Accordingly, this study distinguishes collaborative mobility from coded mobility and code/mobility, making the practices from general users indispensable in the collaborative mobility system. Treating collaborative mobility as a social–technical–cultural assemblage, this study takes WeMo Scooter as an example to point out that the (re)definition of the operation zone, the (re)distribution of the scooter network, and the whole system operations are all connected by operators and collective users via mobile media and scooters in a specific social-spatial context. One benefit is that it triggers urban space ambiguities and possibilities for both the operator and general users to (re)understand and (re)build the hybrid urban space and the formation of everyday life. However, it also shows strict dataveillance from operators at the same time. Treating “collaborative mobility” as an interdisciplinary concept, this study also revises some relative concepts in media studies and the mobilities paradigm. For the former, the concept of collaborative mobility indicates that the “hybrid space” exhibits materiality. For the latter, the concept of immobile moorings is changing due to the role that mobile media play in the collaborative mobility system. Because the concept of collaborative mobility is new to media studies and the mobilities paradigm, it is worth more in-depth discussions and empirical studies to develop it into becoming more grounded interdisciplinarily.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1604041051034,145,2020,Mass Communication Research
Locative Media Studies and City Identity: An Investigation of Mainland Chinese Immigrants’ Local Experiences in Hong Kong,Lin Jin,"locative media, media geography, media practice, urban studies","Locative media in the digital age has become a hot topic in both mass media and communication studies. Contemporary academic research on locative media comes from diverse theoretical tributaries: place representation, individuals’ everyday practice, and political economy. This paper thus focuses on individuals’ use of locative media in their daily life. Although locative media studies can be regarded as a relatively mature field, few articles have discussed its current status and potential problems. By reviewing the existing literature, we aim to analyze the objectives and subjects of these articles, reconsider limitations, and propose potential dimensions with specific cases for future research. First, this paper defines locative media as media of communication that are functionally bound to a location, examining three developments necessary for contemporary locative media: location awareness, geoweb, and smartphones. Second, we summarize the latest findings in locative media studies into five themes: sociality, self-presentation, space, place, and mobility. The current research mainly discusses how the everyday use of locative media creates new types of interpersonal relationships and identity, how it changes the relationship between people and space/place, and how it shapes different kinds of mobility. However, these articles overlook the context of media practice. The ways that individuals use their locative media in different cities should vary and are certainly worth an in-depth study. Therefore, this paper focuses on one typical city, Hong Kong, and analyzes Mainland Chinese immigrants’ place-making based on the idea of city identity so as to help expand the research direction on locative media.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1604041324919,145,2020,Mass Communication Research
Mobile Practices in Hybrid Spaces: Utilizing Mobile Maps as Motility,Xu Tongwen,"hybrid spaces, locative media, mobile map, mobile practices, motility","Mobile maps that currently afford people the chance to navigate and explore nearby areas have become an important medium for people to experience urban space. The mobile map, as a form of locative media, combines virtuality and reality and is an integral part of people’s mobile system in the digital age, representing a new mobility and generating new mobile practices. This study thus focuses on what categories of motility and mobile practices have emerged due to the various characteristics of mobile maps. Adopting research methods from the perspective of digital anthropology, this research depicts the mobile practices promoted by mobile maps from three aspects, “hybridization,” “visualization,” and “privatization,” which according to their view reflect the motility of a mobile map. In hybrid movement, the study finds that the connection between the real and the virtual, such as through bodies and “live cursors” as well as physical space and “live interface,” creates a moving cyborg in the hybrid space. As a kind of view technology, it enables people to “see” “themselves” and “others” in this hybrid place, thus setting up the premise of the movement. At the same time, visible movement is characterized by “privatization.” While a mobile map can demonstrate the physical space in accordance with the user’s demand, forming a “hybrid on demand” scenario with “one map for one person,” in a privatized hybrid space the movement is similarly also privatized. Mobile practices, based on mobile maps, help us to rethink the binary oppositions in the field of the traditional representation theory, such as the physical and digital, the body and the medium, and the embodied and the mediated.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1604041504216,145,2020,Mass Communication Research
Computing Urban Life: Data Practices and The Transduction of Everyday Life,Sung-Yueh Perng,"everyday practices, lifelogging, personal big data, quantified self, transduction, wearable technology","The popularity of wearable technologies and the enthusiasm around quantified self and lifelogging movements have encouraged the collection of personal data in comprehensive, objective, and sustained ways for computing urban life. In light of these emergent data practices, this paper explores and critically reflects upon how such practices are undertaken and what consequences they engender. Most studies in the literature concerned with quantified self and lifelogging have focused their discussion on the practices of knowing, the sociomaterial contexts of knowledge practices, or the political economic consequences of such modes of knowing. The paper thus proposes to understand data practices as an ontogenetic process and analyzes their transduction of everyday life. The paper is based on the research conducted in Dublin and Boston between 2014 and 2016. Building on this empirical research, I demonstrate how wearable technologies and wearers of related products attempt to reconfigure each other when transforming life into data and how this process unexpectedly and unevenly transduces ways in which everyday life is undertaken. What this process has achieved then is not a complete translation of everyday life into data, rather, the parts of life that are easier to record receive more attention and the data about them become enriched and expanded, at the expense of others that are difficult for computing logic to work with. Such uncertain and uneven processes of transduction can complicate any claims and sociotechnical imaginaries of a complete translation of everyday life into data and the computing of such data for engineering better societal futures.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1604042176877,145,2020,Mass Communication Research

Through Scruff, a social network-based social application, the study queries eight interviewees to explore the meaning of the Kaohsiung gay community ecology and living space under the evolution of the current times via purposive sampling. The interviewees previously had the desire to meet someone attractive in the dark space when being young, went through the nostalgic era of looking for gay friends on the left bank of the Love River with the laborers, and also experienced the urban gay culture when joined by American soldiers and foreign sailors. However, with the evolution of communication technology, they started to present themselves in a conservative and cautious way like a masquerade through online interaction and have sought companions under the condition of aesthetic homogeneity. The real-time communication between the proximity of the Internet and location allows multiple overlapping of physical and virtual dating spaces. In addition to presenting the geographical location space interwoven by “socio-sexualized” behaviors and finally gaining positive social support by actually appearing and communicating with each other, the elderly gay men have gradually gotten rid of the negative stereotypes of social isolation. Furthermore, because of the legality of gay marriage, it was originally only supported by virtual or private physical space, but has now expanded to legal social support at the social and national levels. After same-sex friends can legally become partners, this has importantly reversed the phenomenon that friends are more important than partners in past heterosexual marriages. Such comprehensive levels of social support are still not available in other Asian countries, and the legal gay marriage phenomenon shows the value of this LGBTQ research on elderly gay men in Kaohsiung.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1611590894791,146,2021,Mass Communication Research
The Digital Labor and Gender Politics of Female Social Live Streamers in China,"Yi-Chieh Jessica Lin, Man-Ting Shan","China, digital labor, gender, live streaming, performativity, platform capitalism","Social live streaming services have recently expanded rapidly in China and acquired a large viewing segment in the country’s market for such services. The majority of so-called broadcasters are women, who emphasize the sexualization of the self and offer services such as chatting, singing, and dancing in exchange for remuneration through virtual gifts, membership fees, and Internet advertising. Based on semi-structured interviews and Internet ethnography, this study examines the motivation and labor processes of female social live streaming broadcasters in China. The study initially delineates how the broadcasters navigate through this new media environment, conduct gendered performances, develop personal brands, and manage the social network of fans with the assistance of their agencies and live streaming platforms staffs. We then show how the broadcasters meticulously carry out affective labor and emotional labor in their gendered performances in order to convert relational labor into economic capital. The paper next engages in a dialogue with studies of post-feminist media culture to discuss whether or not the technology of social live streaming services actually empowers female broadcasters. The broadcasters not only actively manipulate their femininity in exchange for the attention and support of male fans but also accumulate social support and economic capital. Although the format of social live streaming allows for more participation from the audience, the research data present that this particular mechanism also exposes female live broadcasters to gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Therefore, due to this environment female broadcasters have limited autonomy over the content of their gendered performances. Finally, this paper discusses how the female broadcasters in this study adopt different strategies to protect their privacy and safety.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1611591163031,146,2021,Mass Communication Research
The Narrative Structures and Representation of Homosexuality in Taiwanese BL TV Dramas,"Wan-Chun Wen, Song-In Wang","narrative analysis, representation of homosexuality, semiotic analysis, Taiwanese BL TV drama","Boy’s Love (BL) TV drama is a genre depicting homosexual love between two male characters and has become very popular in Taiwan. The present study thus examines the narrative structures of six Taiwanese BL TV dramas broadcast from 2017 to 2019 by employing dramatic structural methods developed by Vladimir Propp and using semiotic analysis to uncover the implied homosexuality represented in these six dramas. The first research objective is to analyze the narrative structures of Taiwanese BL TV drama and to investigate if they are the same as those of traditional TV drama. The results of narrative analysis show that all the characters in the six BL TV dramas could be resolved into six abstract character functions (villain, dispatcher, helper, princess, donor, and hero), except for the character function of the false hero, and that the plot structures perfectly follow the traditional sequences of narratemes: initial situation, counteraction of heroes, resolution of problems, and happy ending. Findings also show that BL TV dramas attempt to create a utopia where romance takes precedent over the gender of the subjects, creating a homonormative discourse. While this may create a gender-friendly discourse, BL dramas also downplay the struggles, obstacles, and conflicts that gay people may face in real life, such as the problem of self-identity, relationships with conservative parents, and peer pressure. Some dramas also emphasize differences in the role-playing of “seme” (“the man”) and “uke” (“the woman”). The above-mentioned features of Taiwanese BL TV drama could thus reinforce the stereotypes of homosexuality.

"Pick Me Up! Taking Dream as a Symbol: Femininity, Empowerment, an Neoliberalism of Chinese Female Trainees in the in the Era of Postfeminism",Zhong Fangqi,"feminism, feminism critical discourse analysis, neoliberalism, reality show","The first nurturing idol variety show in China, Creation 101, was launched in 2018. The show was labelled as an “Idol Girl Group Competitive Reality Show” and quickly gained widespread attention after its broadcast. By employing feminist critical discourse analysis as a method and with feminism and neoliberal theories as a basis of analysis, this paper explores the flowing ideology and the power structure behind the aforementioned program and infers the current feminist development in China. This study draws the following conclusions. First, the program presents a localized femininity with a pursuit of personality, in combination of traditional Chinese and modern popular culture. Which means that the Western privileges under post-colonialism have failed in China, and that the localized gender subjective consciousness of the Chinese female is beginning to rise. Second, the female has a “wrested power” in breaking stereotypes, establishing subjectivity and participating in the public domain, implying that China seems to have entered the post-feminist era. Nonetheless, female characters in the show are still presented as ‘charming girls,’ resembling sexual objects for the pleasure of the heterosexual male viewer. Thus, the male hegemony still exists, only it has transformed into a form of self-materialization among women, continuing to dominate and control the female. Third and finally, due to the rise of the feminist movement, today's patriarchy is more fragmented than it was before. It has intersected with other forms of power in society and still plays an invisible but destructive role contemporarily.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1611591885354,146,2021,Mass Communication Research
Media Attention and Framing Analysis of Environmental Issues: Taking Air Pollution Issue as An Example,Yie-Jing Yang,"air pollution, framing analysis, media attention, quantity of coverage theory","This study applies media quantity analysis and content analysis methods to analyze media attention and media representation of air pollution issues. Quantity analysis of five newspapers in Taiwan and the U.S. from 1987 to 2017 finds that the issue of air pollution has always been the focus of media reports. The overall coverage quantity has always been on the rise during the study period, starting to climb in 2011, reaching the second highest point of media attention in 2015, and hitting the highest peak in 2017. Although U.S. newspapers present the most reports, they are different from the increasing trend of Taiwan media, as the former paid more attention to air pollution in the early days. Content analysis is based on a comparative analysis of two newspapers, The United Daily News and The New York Times in 2017. The results of the study point out that Taiwan’s air pollution news reports mostly appear during the winter, whereas U.S. newspaper coverage of air pollution is spread relatively evenly over different months. The Taiwan newspaper’s air pollution news mainly targets the country’s own air pollution issues, whereas The New York Times by contrast also reports other regions’ news of air pollution. Taiwan’s newspaper reports air pollution that mainly occurs in the south region. As for topics of air pollution, The United Daily News and The New York Times reported the most topics covering government responsibility and related policies. The news sources of the two newspapers are not the same. The United Daily News pays more attention to “official and expert sources”, while The New York Times quotes multiple sources. The United Daily News and The New York Times have most often reported on the “Rebirth framing”, but the former has done so significantly more than the latter. In addition, The United Daily News has focused more attention on discussing air pollution responsibilities than has The New York Times, while the latter has focused more on the environmental damage, losses and possible diseases caused by air pollution. Overall, Taiwanese and U.S. newspapers have different news framing of air pollution reporting.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1619615211254,147,2021,Mass Communication Research
Building a Framework for Journalists’ Communication Tools and Their Interacting Relationships: An Investigation Via Social Capital Exchange and Remediation,Ya-Hui Chen,"communication tools, human face theory, journalists and news resource, relationships, remediation, social capital","In the current digital convergence era, this research focuses on how journalists interact with people through communication tools. From the logic of remediation, the study establishes two kinds of communication tools: one is a reporting tool to solve news storytelling under the logic of transparency, and the other is for recognizing the logic of hypermedia, which are social tools that bring together a variety of connections. Under these two modes of communication tools, looking further at social capital exchange, journalists employ reporting tools to exchange information into situated viewing relationships, in order to complete the relevant tasks in the news production process, which is often based on the principle of seeking truth from facts. Journalists also utilize social tools to develop networking relationships for human communication, in order to extend the possibility of a relationship between the links, so that private friendship can reserve more space for interpersonal interaction. This research thus establishes a theoretical framework in which journalists use communication tools to interact with people and transforms the knowledge of tacit understanding into a process of concretization.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1619615843115,147,2021,Mass Communication Research
"Politics of Documentary in Time: The Mediatized Story Consequences of Fly, Kite Fly",Wan-Lin Tsao,"communicative figurations, documentary, mediatization, temporality, transforming communications, zone of intermediacy","In this age of continuously transforming communications, the media are increasingly intertwined into the texture of people’s daily life, thus changing the constructive process of practices both in communication and other social domains. The accelerating speed generated by media technology often denotes the time metaphor where the post-modern age is located. This study thus aims to extend a reflexive discourse with the concept of communicative figurations in the constructive approach of mediaization theories. From the alternative perspective of temporality, it explores how the documentary Fly, Kite Fly, the first ecological theatrical film released in Taiwan, generated multiple ‘timescape’ articulated technology, genre, and text in the zone of intermediacy. Not confined to a binary divide between the text and audience in the cross-media narrative process, key social actors are interviewed and invited to look back so as to interpret the mediatized story consequences that still substantially affect environmental conservation and eco-friendly agriculture. This research adopts a cross-media perspective of “transforming communication” to trace the three characteristics of communicative figurations, including frames of relevance, constellations of actors, and communicative practices. On the one hand, it analyzes how media and communication embed both new and old media forms (written articles, documentaries, face-to-face interactive communication, online communities, etc.) in their narrative practices, on the other hand, it explores how society and culture change along with them. The purpose is to 1) understand and interpret the complex dialectical relationship between social construction and media communication that is increasingly more intertwined, and 2) to see how to achieve a strategic reversal in the action of “thick time” dialogue through reflexivity in the deep mediatization era, which is a constantly accelerating trend of the “thin time” connectivity.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1619615981942,147,2021,Mass Communication Research
“Ideal” and “Utopia”: On Cheng Shewo’s Idea of Journalism Education and Its Practice,"Li Shixin, Liu Mengxi","combined use of hands and brains, division of labor, labor conflict, Peiping College of Journalism","The low popularity of Chinese newspapers, labor conflicts, and the contradiction between mental labor and physical labor were the main problems of modern Chinese press. By establishing the Peiping College of Journalism, Cheng Shewo wanted to train students to become professionals who could engage in both mental labor and physical labor. In this way, if the employees were able to play overlapping roles and share all the work across different departments, then contradictions between them would be easily solved. Newspapers run under labor cooperation could help with the development of this form of media and continue to promote their popularization. However, Cheng Shewo did not realize that the contradiction between mental labor and physical labor was mainly caused by the limitation of division of labor. Artificially breaking the segregation of the two different forms of labor violated the objective law of the development of division of labor, but at the same time created a new contradiction—that was, labor conflicts. Cheng Shewo’s educational idea of the “combined use of hands and brains”, as he stated, did not provide a satisfactory solution, as it was only “a Utopian attempt”, except for its ability to expand the knowledge and printing skills of students. Cheng Shewo’s idea of “newspaper sovereignty sharing” was also closely related to his idea of “combined use of hands and brains” and furthermore treated the chronic problem of the Chinese press. In fact, the idea of “newspaper sovereignty sharing”, which aimed to alleviate labor conflicts, was to abolish the division of labor between management and execution. This was inconsistent with Cheng Shewo’s actual identities of the owner and manager of his newspapers and thus could not be implemented.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1619616168064,147,2021,Mass Communication Research
Precarious Media Labor in the Era of Post COVID-19: Rethinking the Supporting Policy for Film and TV Industry in Globally and in Taiwan,"Hui-Ju Tsai, Yu-Peng Lin","COVID-19, cultural labor, cultural policy, film & TV industry, neoliberalism, precariousness","The film industry has experienced rather severe times in the post- COVID-19 epidemic era. Hollywood estimates that nearly 200,000 people will be unemployed, and Taiwan’s movie theaters have also suffered heavy losses at the initial stage. Faced with such a severe environment, the jobs of film and television workers have really been a big challenge. The precariousness and inequalities of free-lance or self-employed workers may further be impacted. This study examines film, television, and cultural industries. With the theme of cultural labor, through in-depth interviews and relevant policy analysis we aim to answer three levels of questions. The first level lies in the current fragile cultural labor environment. What is the appearance of creative and cultural labor under the influence of the epidemic? Does this deepen its vulnerability? The second level is a discussion at the policy level, the public sector’s rescue plan and implementation of the cultural and creative industry, the impact on workers, and whether it is possible to develop new policies that are more public and inclusive through this epidemic. The third layer observes the plight and new possibilities of cultural labor under the epidemic through the actions and trends of governments, film, and television labor unions as well as the film and television industry around the world during the epidemic. This research adopts Murray & Gollmitzer’s (2012) concept of ‘creative ecology’, which provides us a new framework of a better cultural and creative industries policy to improve the employment conditions of precarious cultural workers. This research hopes to provide new perspectives on cultural labor as well as substantive suggestions on the relationship between cultural labor and policy.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1627545490624,148,2021,Mass Communication Research
How College Students’ Cognition of Cloud Academic Lectures Strengthens Their Continual Willingness to Share During COVID-19:A Moderated Mediation Model,"Zhiwu He, Tianming Chen","cloud academic lectures, continual willingness, COVID-19, distance e-learning, information sharing","Internet technology and social media have played key fundamental roles in distance e-learning for college students in China during COVID-19. This study constructs a moderated mediation model to explore the relationship between college students’ cognition of cloud academic lectures and their continual willingness to share, including the mediating effects of motivation for sharing and the moderating effects of self-construal. Based on the theoretical perspective of “cognition-motivation-willingness,” we use a common two-step procedure: First, we have in-depth interviews with 15 college students who are active participants in cloud academic lectures. Second, we further conduct a nationwide online survey and generate 431 results from college-student users in China. Exploratory analysis shows that the cognition of cloud academic lectures has significantly positive effects on continual willingness to share after controlling the factors of gender, education, and major. Among the four motivations for sharing, achievement, knowledge self-efficacy, altruistic, and social motivation, only altruistic motivation and knowledge self-efficacy significantly exhibit mediating effects, with the former mediating effect negatively moderated by independent self-construal, whereas the latter mediating effect is not moderated by interdependent self-construal. The results show that college students generally have high evaluations of cloud academic lectures and a strong willingness for continual sharing. The mean value of altruistic motivation is the highest among the four sharing motivations. In terms of the sharing channels, WeChat groups and WeChat Moments play significant roles. The findings of this study contribute to the academic institutes’ understanding of presentation form, content production, and user experience for cloud academic lectures in the post-epidemic era. More importantly, these results are meaningful to improve the cognitive evaluation and information-sharing willingness a",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1627545623962,148,2021,Mass Communication Research
Cross-domain Identity Transformation of Rural Elites through the Pandemic: Gift Exchange as an Enabling Medium,"Yuting Sun, Yong Zhou, Chaoyun Liang","elite circulation, gift exchange, identity transformation, old-new alteration, returning elites, skilled farmers","This research examines a case of poverty alleviation through industrialization in east rural China to explore the identity transformation of returning elites when they engage in rural field. The study employs field research and applies the theory of elite circulation in which gift exchange is regarded as an enabling medium to accelerate circulation. The results reveal that a diversified, flexible, and dynamic gift-driven action strategy that is shaped by different types of gifts helps promote the cross-domain identity transformation of elites and facilitates circulation between those with different social statuses and the old and new elites. The highlighted findings are as follows. (1) The knowledge and social capital that elites have accumulated through urban experiences are regarded as a gift for their returning village. (2) Poverty alleviation through industrialization is perceived as a gift that transforms the elites from urban cultural elites to village economic elites. (3) Voluntary helping actions are perceived as gifts that facilitate the continuous transformation of village economic elites into village societal elites. (4) The emergence of the large-scale public crisis of COVID-19 has brought opportunities for strategic actions. The returning elites have carried out a series of gift-like disaster relief operations, which have brought diversified identity transformations and strategic disaster relief operations. (5) Returning elites have empowered skilled farmers with symbolic gifts, which provide these farmers with opportunities to enter the elite hierarchy, however, these new entries could be rapidly displaced by newer empowered farmers, because of the strength of inertial thinking and the weakness of assuming professional roles. This study further explores the dynamic pattern of rural governance and the logic of poverty alleviation under the reconstruction of rural areas that are a product of the identity transformation of rural elites and circulation between hierarchies, which are subsequently shaped by the poverty-alleviating effect of industrialization in rural areas.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1627545255561,148,2021,Mass Communication Research
"Preventive Measures as a New Lifestyle During and After COVID-19: The Interplay of Media, Emotions, and Risk Perception",Tsung-Jen Shih,"COVID-19, fear, preventive measures, risk perception, social media use","The COVID-19 pandemic seriously struck the world in early 2020 and has exerted great impacts on every aspect of human life. Whether the disease can be contained or not depends greatly on how well people take preventive measures over an extended period of time. This study thus integrates theories from risk communication and media effects to understand the predictors of preventive measures, with a specific focus on the interplay among media, risk perception, and emotion. Based on a representative, dual-frame telephone survey (N = 1,073), the current study finds that people’s ways of living have changed quite drastically during the pandemic. More than 8 out of 10 Taiwanese expressed wearing face masks (82.9%) and washing hands (83.1%) more frequently than the usual level, while 63.6% of people indicated that they have tried to avoid going out, unless it is necessary, such as going to work or school. More than one-third of Taiwanese had canceled a planned trip (35.7%) and about a quarter are considering to do so (23.0%). Results of regression analyses suggest that risk perception is not directly predictive of people’s preventive behaviors, but it does positively affect behaviors by increasing people’s level of fear, lending support to the “emotion mediation model.” The results also indicate an amplifying effect of television on the relationship between risk perception and fear. Conversely, social media use exerts an attenuating effect that mitigates the impact of risk perception on preventive behaviors. The results extend the applicability of the social amplification of the risk framework from risk perception to subsequent emotional and behavioral responses. Further implications are discussed.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1627545445541,148,2021,Mass Communication Research

Through field analysis, in-depth interviews, and text analysis, the study presents the following findings. (1) Hardcover popular science books that emphasize hard-shell binding and color printing of pictures have become a trend, and through direct sales channels they have repeatedly created “sales legends” of NT$1 millions of dollars a day. (2) Most popular science books are translated from Japan’s version rather than from those of Europe and the United States and appeal to children and students, making them an extension of science education. (3) The interdisciplinary integration model of cooperation between the publishing industry and scientists has been valued by the latter and aims to advocate that scientific knowledge must be correct. (4) The industry has relied on the selection of articles and related edited chapters of the college entrance system, compiling a parent-teacher manual to guide parent-child learning together. (5) Direct sales channels through interpersonal communication have created “sales legends”. (6) Relevant themes are arranged in accordance with the content of the natural science textbooks of the country and high school, as well as “the origin of life”, “the origin of species/evolution theory”, and “the birth of earth”. (7) The narrative strokes of popular science books are similar to textbooks, but more colloquial and simplified. (8) Scientific knowledge visualization has become a trend, not only through concrete scientific viewpoints, but also because of a lack of science cultural viewpoints, which is the only sugar coating that once again strengthens the authority of science.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1635224811485,149,2021,Mass Communication Research

With U.S. armed force activities around Taiwan increasing, this research examines the influence of American Asia-Pacific strategies toward Taiwan on Taiwanese war risk perceptions and responses from the media. Believing that online responses by Taiwanese represent part of public opinion, we take an online public opinion mining approach to explore the topic modeling of online discussions over this issue. When discussing U.S. armed force activities around the Taiwan Strait, the findings show five major topics that Taiwan’s netizens focus on:(1) Taiwan-Sino-U.S. game,(2) activities for seeking independence,(3) strategic evaluation,(4) risk of war, and (5) policy on freedom of navigation. This article contributes to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and corpus approaches to present national strategic studies that previously mostly used constructed approaches. Regarding the theoretical applications, we provide a new research approach for risk communication on strategies studies, extending its theoretical scope to national strategic studies. Moreover, we demonstrate that online public opinion toward risk perceptions and military activities of the government can address the vital issue of public support toward national defense strategies. We also found that U.S. military activities influence Taiwanese people’s perception of war risk and negative emotions expressed online. This means that their online emotions significantly influence their propensity to support public policies.

The Relative Effect between Humorous and Non-Humorous Rebuttal: The Moderation of Candidate’s Core Image,Hsuan-Yi Chou,"candidate image, humor, negative attacks, rebuttal, response strategies","Negative attacks on candidates or disclosures that could potentially impact their image appear frequently during elections. When being attacked, a candidate’s response is often crucial for gauging the impact of the accusation, the persistence of the charge(s), and voters’ assessments on the views of both the responding and attacking sides. Previous studies have focused on the impact of negative attacks and how to effectively design attack content, but there is little focus on candidates’ responses to negative charges as well as methods to identify which response strategies are more effective under specific conditions. Accordingly, this study explores the effect of using humorous rebuttal versus non-humorous rebuttal when responding to a candidate’s image being attacked by an opponent. In addition, it examines how the rebuttal leads to better effects when the attack goes against the candidate’s core and non-core images. The results of three experiments show that when a candidate’s core image is attacked and voters’ original perception of that core image is based on the candidate’s educational background, work experience, and previous performance as a public official, then using a humorous rebuttal or non-humorous rebuttal yields similar effects. However, if the core image perception comes from stereotypes, regardless of gender or attractiveness labels, then using a non-humorous rebuttal improves voters’ attitudes and voting intentions toward the responding candidate. When a candidate’s non-core image is attacked, humorous rebuttal generates better rebuttal effects. The research findings offer a theoretical contribution to research areas such as response strategies to negative attacks, candidate image, gender stereotypes, and attractiveness labels and provide practical suggestions for campaign teams on how to respond to negative attacks.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1635223940341,149,2021,Mass Communication Research
"Path Dependence in the Asymmetrical Distribution of Power: The Origins, Modulation, and Historical Evolution of Three Press Laws in Iran","Mengshan Ren, Chengye Li","Islamic Republic of Iran, Khomeinism, Press Law","From the establishment of Khomeini’s regime in 1979 to the present, Iran’s Press Law has followed the political climate in the Islamic Republic, featuring a clear “path dependence”. The logical beginning of the changing regulatory regime of the Iranian press can be traced back to the importation of modern newspapers and magazines into Iran in recent times. In contrast to the mosque, mass media are not as accessible to traditional society and religious figures. Through the “institutional breaking point” of the Islamic Revolution in 1979, this historical entanglement evolved into an asymmetrical distribution of power in the initial set-up of Iran’s press regulatory system. Through the 1979 version of the Press Law and the Constitution, the press was placed under the “tutelage” of religious conservatives. This asymmetry was further reinforced by subsequent versions of the Press Law from 1979 to 1989, highlighted by the 1986 version of the Press Law that significantly increased the power of religious conservatives to regulate the press. After the death of Ruhollah Khomeini, the two Presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammed Khatami wanted to unbundle the press with reforms, which led to a conservative backlash and an awkward situation of “one step forward, two steps back further”. After 2005, although new media technologies overwhelmed the hard-line government, they were no match for the “neo-Khomeinist” Nejad’s strong measures to regulate the press. In 2003, the new President Hassan Rouhani’s course deviated from the radical policies of his predecessors, as he looked to strike a balance between the expectations of the reformists and the hammering of conservatives. In the end, the basic framework of Iran’s press regulation continues to be as solid as a rock.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1635224149554,149,2021,Mass Communication Research
Digital Narrative Production in the Era of Media Convergence: Taking Campus Media as an Example,Huei-Chun Chi,"campus media, digital narrative, interdisciplinary response, narrative","Digital narratives have become such a prevalent form of news reporting that they play an indispensable role in the teaching curriculum of mass communications. Composed of the elements of journalism, computer science, information theory, and visual design, not only do they challenge the existing boundaries of mass communications through an interdisciplinary nature, but they also expose students to the complexities in utilizing computer programs, datasets, design tools, and digital devices, bringing innovations to the academic community. Curriculum reforms have been put in place by many universities to equip students with theoretical knowledge and the professional skills of handling digital narratives, by introducing the use of online multi-media tools, the production of diverse contents, and the use of analytical tools and web builders, while not forsaking the basics of traditional journalism. Taking the campus media in the mass communication department of a local university with a history of 36 years as an example, vocational training for video news production has been provided from day one. Moreover, the use of web builders such as WordPress and Wix.com, which incorporate workflows such as news gathering, editing, censoring, and broadcasting, has been introduced since 2017 to cope with the rise of the digital era. This study seeks to understand students’ apprehension of the difference between digital narrative production and traditional news production, to observe the change in the demand of talents and in the dynamics within work teams, and to explore possible changes in future curriculum. As such, focus group interviews were conducted with fourteen students who had taken part in the production of three in-depth stories in 2020, applying the digital narrative for campus media as mentioned above, while in-depth interviews were also carried out with three teachers and one intern. The study revealed that students found it confusing to perceive the distinction between digital media and mass media, because they used to interpret news reporting in a rigid way and thus failed to explore the nature of the digital narrative. It therefore implies that the traditional linear narrative is no longer applicable pertaining to digital convergence and means students are not only required to master digital tools, but also have to grasp the idea that media convergence should not be simplified as merely a technique about using digital tools, and that the structure of the digital narrative is different from that of the traditional narrative. Interviews in this study indicated that students recognized they have to diversify their ability of story-telling by acquiring practical skills of digital production, including recording, coordination, editing, and disseminating, rather than limiting themselves to a certain area of expertise as they were taught under the long-established approach of journalism education. On the grounds that prospective journalists are expected to play multiple roles in the digital era, by differing from the conventional newsroom-centricity model that emphasizes a division of labor and adopts a top-down approach of management with a highly synchronized industrial production style, it is suggested that radio services, television broadcasts, and newspapers operating independently should now be integrated into a digitalized platform where journalists from print media and broadcast media can collaborate with digital journalists on various news themes. At the same time, teachers and students can also experiment under various ways of story-telling through different types of media with a hands-on approach that allows students to apply what they have learned in class, aiming at cultivating prospective all-round journalists via the process of ‘learning by doing’. Catering to the demands of the audience is essential for conceiving digital narratives, by providing information and also managing expectations from the audience. The duty of journalists has shifted from pure reporting to illustrating information. The significance of visual spatial designs and multiple reading strategies therefore outweighs that of the linear narrative with regard to the digital narrative. This echoes previous research showing that spatial arrangement, instead of time sequence, has become the key for organizing stories when it comes to the digital narrative and demonstrating visual spatial layers in news presentations. Such a change itself represents the fact that digital narrative production has been liberated from the traditional conceptual system that is centric, peripheral, hierarchical, and linear, evolving into a hypertext format that is multi-linear and contains a network of nodes and links. Previous studies have reflected that the objective of interdisciplinary studies is to establish connections between various disciplines in order to extend the boundaries of knowledge. The interdisciplinary feature of the digital narrative, as this study highlights, is the reason for the obstacles faced by many students attempting to utilize computer programs, datasets, design tools, and digital devices. Hence, solutions to know-how should be the focal point of interdisciplinary studies in the future as it is no longer restricted by the historic classification of disciplines constructed by power. A series of curriculum reforms thus deserves to be considered under the influence of media convergence. In this age of paradigm shifts, the modules and teaching methods of journalism education should be thoroughly reexamined with concerted efforts made by all educators so as to systematically and precisely capture the thoughts of the entire education community. To cultivate students’ ability in employing the digital narrative, it is suggested to crucially develop their capability at mastering digital tools, as well as to uncover how the digital era has influenced the way news stories are organized, with an emphasis on the importance of demonstrating the combination of visual and spatial presentations. On that account, enhancing the ability to produce digital narratives not only implies an instrument-wise transformation, but also establishes concepts differing from the traditional linear narrative and hence calls for an utter change in the teaching model and a more innovative way of thinking.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1643088138077,150,2022,Mass Communication Research
Factors Influencing Viewers’ Social Support for Live Streamers: Parasocial Interaction and Telepresence Perspectives,Shaojung Sharon Wang,"live streaming, loneliness, parasocial interaction, social support, telepresence, voyeurism","Background: Live streaming is a form of media that involves recording and broadcasting simultaneously via the Internet in real time. Due to the recent advancement of real-time broadcasting technologies, the increase of high-bandwidth connections, and the popularization of mobile devices, the technical threshold for creating and delivering live media content has been greatly lowered. Live streaming platforms have thus rapidly proliferated across the global digital landscape, and programs on such platforms have garnered a large number of user-generated content. Since 2015, live streaming has become one of the important way for viewers in Taiwan to consume content. Live streaming not only allows viewers to interact with the streamers in real time and in person through text messages, but the mechanism of giving virtual currencies and gifts on the platforms has also created a new type of business model and transformed everyday people into influencers. Purpose: Considering the design and mechanism of live streaming platforms and characteristics of user-generated content, the goal of this research is to integrate the theoretical lens of parasocial interaction and telepresence to investigate factors that may influence live streaming viewers to provide social support to the streamers. Given that use and gratification, selective reception, and media effects can mutually promote audience’s media consumption process, which may affect the attitudes and behaviors stimulated by media, this study further explores five antecedents, sensation seeking, perceived novelty, mediated voyeurism, wishful identification, and loneliness, that may contribute to parasocial interaction and then proposes and tests an integrated model. Method: A sample of 1001 live streaming viewers (467 males, 46.7% and 534 females, 53.3%) who were 20 years and older (M=33.82, SD=7.539) and had donated to streamers was recruited through market research panels and completed the survey. The survey was fielded for two weeks. The questionnaire consisted of 45 questions, including five filter questions to determine participants’ eligibility to proceed. All items in this study were measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale, except for demographic questions. Structural equation modeling with maximum likelihood estimations using AMOS 20 was employed for path analysis followed by a bootstrap method to test the mediation effects. Findings: The results demonstrate that three antecedents - namely, perceived novelty (β =.252, p=.000), mediated voyeurism (β =.366, p=.000), and wishful identification (β =.445, p=.000) - positively correlate with parasocial interaction. Sensation seeking (β=.164, p=.000), loneliness (β =.251, p=.000), and parasocial interaction (β =.765, p=.000) have positive relationships with telepresence. The paths from telepresence to three dimensions of social support, emotional (β=.752, p=.000), instrumental (β=.815, p=.000), and financial support (β=.782, p=.000), are particularly salient. Mediation analysis using bootstrapping with 5,000 samples and a bias-corrected 95% confidence interval further reveals that the direct effect from sensation seeking to telepresence is significant (β =.164, p=.000, CI=〔.096, .236〕), but the indirect effect from parasocial interaction to telepresence is not significant. Therefore, the mediation effect from sensation seeking to telepresence through parasocial interaction is not supported. Although the direct effect from loneliness to telepresence is significant (β =.251, p=.000, CI=〔.195, .331〕), the indirect effect from loneliness to telepresence through parasocial interaction is not significant. Thus, the mediation effect from loneliness to telepresence through parasocial interaction is not supported either. Implications: Theoretical implications may be drawn from this study. First, this study takes an active audience perspective to extend the context of selective media exposure and emotional needs and further identifies the antecedents of parasocial interaction. It provides empirical evidence for the causes and consequences of a parasocial experience in live streaming scenarios. Second, this study finds a positive relationship between parasocial interaction and telepresence and further explores the relationships between telepresence and three dimensions of social support (emotional, instrumental, financial). It incorporates media study and consumer behavior research on telepresence to explain live streaming viewers’ provision of monetary and non-monetary incentives to the streamers to broaden the application of this concept. Finally, live streaming consists of the characteristics of both mass communication and interpersonal communication as streamers can broadcast media content to a large anonymous audience and at the same time interact with viewers in real time. Therefore, live streaming is considered as a type of masspersonal communication. This study explores how viewers transform the media content exposure into a channel to support the streamers and extends the social support research to a masspersonal communication-mediated environment.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1643088418646,150,2022,Mass Communication Research
"Assembled Actions and Hybridized Emotions: The Posting, Articulating, and Symbiosis of Depressed People “with” Instagram","Chia-Rong Tsao, Zhao-Hong Chen","assemblage, Instagram, new materialism, posthuman, the depressed people","This research examines how “we” (including human and non-human actors) affect each other on Instagram and thus engender emotions, feelings, and actions in the contemporary post-human condition. Different from Sherry Turkle’s argument in Alone Together, we do not regard the state of always relying on connections with each other to be a symptom of a fragile and narcissistic self. This research argues that, in the post-human condition, we are no longer traditional humanist subjects who are regarded as independent and individualized subjects. The concepts of “self” and “subject” need to be redefined and understood in the context of contemporary technological developments and changes. It is not to say that “humans” do not have “self” or are not “subject” anymore, rather it means that what needs to be changed is to treat “human” as completely independent individuals with definite boundaries. The post-human condition also means that the perspective of traditional humanism no longer can explain who (or what) are the real “actors” any more. In other words, we need to reconsider everyday life from the more-than-human perspective. This research takes the daily using and posting practices of depressed people on Instagram as the example and adopt new materialism as our theoretical frame. Taking depressed people on Instagram as the example does not mean that they are special cases. On the contrary, we regard the efforts and struggles of depressed people on Instagram as activities against the contemporary consumer culture. Unlike “normal” users who typically present their glamorous selves, depressed users on Instagram look for a supportive place or relationship. Their activities also accentuate how humans (and non-humans) affect each other and through this illuminate for us the limitation of Turkle’s criticism of “the collaborative self”, which is based on the perspective of the traditional humanism. The research materials are mainly gathered in two ways. First, one of the researchers, who is also a depressed Instagram user, records his own experiences and observations on Instagram. The researcher began writing his own daily experiences and feelings on Instagram in 2014 and started to make connections with other depressed users through the mediation of specific hashtags at the beginning of 2018. The researcher recorded these personal experiences and field observations during early 2018 to early 2020 through his autobiographical writing and field notes. The second part of our research materials is interview data of depressed users with whom the researcher make connections on Instagram. In addition to building relationships online, depressed users on Instagram also have held offline gatherings to develop relationships further. The researcher has joined the gatherings several times and through this built trusted relationships with some of the participants. After that, the researcher interviewed four depressed users in late 2019 and early 2020. To explicate our theoretical perspective for analyzing depressed Instagram users’ connections and relationships, this research discusses how the new materialism and post-human theories could contribute to our analysis. In a nutshell, this theoretical frame could (1) give a different viewpoint that does not see technologies or artificial objects as just neutral and passive tools and therefore will not confine them in the analysis of the contents of communication, (2) in contrast to the affordance theory that already brought the technological objects and their mediation into focus, this theoretical frame also goes further to foreground the “affects” of users’ (and non-human actors’) interactions, which is beyond (or below) their conscious activities, (3) in this theoretical perspective, the “human action” is the assembled process that continues affecting or being affected, instead of being the only cause of social events, (4) thereupon, in this assembled process, all kinds of non-human actors, including the touchscreen of a mobile phone, the memory of the mobile phone system, the user interface of Instagram, the internal database of Instagram, the algorithms, etc., become users in every interaction, (5) at last, we argue in the post-human condition that all kinds of activities and relationships, which engender our emotions and feelings, are the complicated assembled process involving human and non-human actors. This research therefore “re-assembles” the connection and activities of the depressed Instagram users. Through this, the heterogeneously assembled process will be dismantled and unfolded. From the perspective of the new materialism, Instagram is not just a tool or medium, and the users are also not individualized subjects whose feelings and emotions are engendered inside. Instagram, as an assembled digital object, can act. More clearly, the Instagram users, mobile phones, and Instagram itself are assembled to affect and be affected with each other. This research argues that, by exploring the practices of depressed people on Instagram, we are able to illustrate how emotions and actions are engendered in the interacting process of the (affected) user, mobile phone, Instagram, and other users. Hence, we can understand how these engendered emotions and actions affect other members further. This research also argues that the actions and experiences of depressed people on Instagram are not unique. On the contrary, those are also every “normal” person’s actual daily life in the post-human condition. “We” could have various kinds of “self”-feelings only after the interacting and articulating process - for example, clicking the Instagram App, recalling a memory by choosing a photo, forming a feeling gradually while retouching the photo, confirming an emotion by adding and deleting the text, being affected by the “like”, etc. Finally, this research suggests that we could go further to explore other aspects of our changing world from the perspective of the new materialism. This research can only discuss the experiences of depressed users on Instagram in a limited length. What we face today are actually more kinds of changes brought by technological development, and they are gradually revealing our post-human condition.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1643089087599,150,2022,Mass Communication Research
Fate and Uncanny Communication: On the Concept of “Communication” in Lacan’s Psychoanalytical Theories,Wei-Yuan Chang,"communication theory, Freud, Lacan, media theory, psychoanalysis, uncanny","Jacques Lacan noted that if we want to understand his concept of “communication,” then we need to pay close attention to Sigmund Freud’s discussions on occultism. This article thus attempts to follow this clue faithfully. By analyzing occultist examples drawn from Freud’s work, I argue that the focal concerns of Lacan’s discussions on “communication” lie in the “uncanny structure of mediation” that unfolds in the subject’s perception at the moment when “communication” deeply affects the subject. The “uncanniness” of this particular “structure of mediation” resides in its ability to receive and transform all kinds of “stimulations” into oracular “messages.” It is through this mode of reception and transformation that the fantasies of “encountering fate” are generated on the side of the subject during the process of communication. In other words, “fate” is an inevitable product of the “uncanny (dimension of) communication.” It is these fantasies of “fate” that give “communication” its existential wight. However, this “uncanny” dimension of communication is also the dimension that “normal” communicative practices - that is, the practices of “meaning making” and “information exchange” - attempt to repress. Although these repressions can never be totally successful, they nonetheless maintain a basic functional state of communication. What these necessary yet also necessarily failed repressions of “meaningful” and “informational” communications show is the following structural role played by the “uncanny communication” - namely, the uncanny dimension of communication constitutes the “spectral background” of all human communicative practices. The “uncanny” dimension of communication is rooted in Lacan’s logic of signifier. The major importance of Lacan’s various discussions on “signifier” does not reside in the signifier in-itself, but rather the “void” opened by the signifier and situated beneath it. It is this void that “calls” for other signifiers to fill in, through which an unstable structural chain of signifiers can be articulated into “meaning effect”. In addition, because these other signifiers that come to fill in the void can never be the one single signifier that opens the void, this void can never be totally concealed. This indestructible void not only is the element that constantly threatens the stability of signifiers’ chain-structure, but more importantly it also has the potentiality to reshuffle the established chain-structure. In other words, this “void” is the constitutive “motor” that activates signifiers’ articulation, de-articulation, and re-articulation dynamics. Moreover, this dynamic has made this void an extra-flexible, infinitely expandable, and ultra-sensitive hole that can capture all other signifiers. This article demonstrates that this “void” resides both in the transmission side of the uncanny communication, which is the Other, and that of the reception side, which is the subject. It is the gravity zone formed between these two voids that allows the transformation of “stimulations” into fateful “messages.” Lacan emphasizes that the principal “interlocutor” of the communicative subject is not the other, but rather the communication system as a whole, which is constituted by signifiers through which a void will always insist within it, making this system an essentially opaque totality. It is this ambiguous system that decides the final meanings and outcomes of the subject’s communicative actions, when the subject is incapable of fully grasping how this system works. As a result of this ambiguity, the subject tends to fantasize a transcendental entity situated beyond this system that can provide this system with a minimal consistency. This transcendental and fantasmatic entity is the Lacanian Other. For Lacan this Other is the only true “interlocutor” of the subject, and the void situated in the midst of this ambiguous communication system symbolizes the “mouth” of the Other. This constitutes one side of picture of the uncanny communication - namely, when engaging in communicative practices, the subject is an anxious subject who stands before the Other and waits for “it” to announce its statements. The Other is usually hidden behind the scene of communication and shows itself only when the response or message sent beck from the ambiguous communication system deeply “hits” the subject. When this “hit” occurs, the subject will experience the empirical other who really talks or writes to him as nothing more than a “channel” or “messenger” through which the Other’s oracular “message” is delivered. The subject necessarily situates on the side of reception in uncanny communication. It is widely known that the Lacanian subject is a subject made from memory traces that are signifiers. However, the most significant point here is not that the subject is constructed by signifiers, but rather voids or holes that are opened in the subject by these signifiers. In other words, what the Lacanian “subject of signifiers” really means is the following - “memory traces/signifiers” inscribed on the subject open or create multiple voids on the subject through which a “porous” subject is constituted. As the Other is normally hidden from view, these “holes” are usually closed, too. They will become “open” only when the subject puts strong doses of affect investments upon them. When these “holes” open, they are not simply any kind of “openings”, but rather “openings” towards the Other, which means that they are the receptive accesses that take in the Other’s “messages.” By ways of analyzing several of Freud’s occultist examples, this article looks to demonstrate that the “void(s) of the subject” and the “void of the Other” constitute a kind of gravity zone or “resonance tube” that elevates literally all “stimulations” entering into it into the status of the Other’s oracular “messages,” whether as omens, fatal messages, or miraculous gifts of love. It is precisely this uncanny “structure of mediation” that underlies our ecstatic experiences when we encounter media products that make a deep “impact” upon us. These media products can contain an “other-worldly” and “unnamable” aura for us (that sometimes can even make us exclaim “this is IT!), because they have been fantasmatically perceived as sent from the Other - that is, our encounters with them will be experienced as “fate” or “destiny.” This fantasmatically fateful feeling is, firstly, where the “weight of communication” resides and, secondly, the target of the “meaningful” and the “informational” communications’ repressions. These repressions are attempts to maintain a minimally “normal” and functional human communication. The “meaning making” dimension of communication functions, on the one hand, as a “productive” repression to the “uncanny communication.” In this “productive” repression, the subject can partially unload the unnamable, uncanny impacts by articulating them into discourses shared within the intersubjective networks through which the established, common intersubjective discourses can constantly reinvigorate themselves. Nevertheless, this “unloading” can never exhaust the uncanny impact and as a result of this inexhaustibility, vortices of renovations will keep “insist[ing]” on the intersubjective, discursive networks. The dimension of “information exchange” of communication works, on the other hand, as an “evasive” repression to the “uncanny communication” by displacing the unnamable impacts and the followed-up meaning-making practices onto the “idiotic” others through which the purely informational subject can evacuate himself from the uncanny dimension of communication. Nevertheless, since the voids on the subject can never be concealed permanently, the uncanny impact will eventually “hit” this purely informational subject. When this “hit” finally arrives, the subject will suffer even stronger senses of uncanny and anxiety. This is what Lacan means when he says that “the letter always arrives at its destination.” In other words, the “porous” subject can never escape from the delivery range of the Other’s “message.” To sum up, the repressions of “meaningful” and “informational” communications towards the “uncanny communication” are both necessary and impossible. As a result of this coincidence of necessity and impossibility, “uncanny communication” can be viewed as the “spectral background” that both anchors and haunts human communication in its generality.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1643089505916,150,2022,Mass Communication Research
"The Media Multitasking Motives and Choice Confidence of GenZ: The Moderated Serial Mediation Model of Conformity, Task Relevance, and Information Diagnosticity",Yuhmiin Chang,"choice confidence, Gen Z, information diagnosticity, media multi-tasking, Taiwan Communication Survey (TCS), task relevance","Background: Generation Z (Gen Z, those born between 1997 to 2012) tends to multitask with multiple media. Studies have shown that media content influences Gen Z’s consumption behaviors that persist until adulthood. Recent studies have also focused on the media combination or the effect of media multi-tasking on the emotion, cognitive control, academic performance, or well-being of Gen Z, yet scant studies have investigated the influence of media multi-tasking on this generation’s consumption behaviors or even choice confidence. Choice confidence positively influences consumers’ intention to pay and to resist competitors’ messages. Objective and hypotheses: This study investigates how different media multi-tasking motives influence the choice confidence of Gen Z and how conformity moderates such effects. It develops three hypotheses based on the uses and gratification theory, task repetition bias, uncertainty reduction theory, and diagnosticity-accessibility perspective. The first hypothesis suggests that habitual-cognitive (vs. emotional-social) motives result in higher task-relevant multi-tasking search (H1-1) and discussion (H1-2) behaviors. The second hypothesis proposes that higher task-relevant multi-tasking search (H2-1) and discussion (H2-2) behaviors lead to higher perceived information diagnosticity and boost subsequent choice confidence. Finally, the third hypothesis advocates that conformity interacts with media multi-tasking motives on task-relevant multi-tasking search (H3-1) and discussion (H3-2) behaviors and moderates the serial mediation effects. The serial mediation effects only hold for Gen Z with lower conformity. Method: This study analyzes the 2020 Taiwanese Communication Survey (Phase Two, Year Four) and its data targeting adolescences. The survey was conducted from November 11, 2020, to January 19, 2021 and used a two-stage stratified cluster sampling design. Five hundred twenty-one weighted cases (539 unweighted cases) reported multitasking with multiple media and analyzed. The measure of media multitasking motive was adapted from Zhang and Zhang (2012) and Wang and Tchernev (2012). The Taiwanese Communication Survey developed the measure of conformity, and the measures of task-relevant multi-tasking search and discussion behaviors were adapted from Ran and Yamamoto (2019). Finally, the measures of perceived information diagnosticity and choice confidence were adapted from Flavián et al. (2016). Findings: The hypotheses involve two moderated serial mediation models: one for multi-tasking search and the other for multi-tasking discussion behavior. This study applies model 83 of Haye’s PROCESS with the 5000 bootstrapping method to analyze the two models. The results show that habitual-cognitive (vs. emotional-social) motive results in higher task-relevant multi-tasking search behavior, b = .85, p < .01, supporting H1-1. Higher task-relevant multi-tasking search behavior leads to greater perceived information diagnosticity, b = .39, p < .001, which leads to higher choice confidence, b = .25, p < .001, supporting H2-1. Finally, conformity significantly interacts with the media multi-tasking motive on task-relevant multi-tasking search behavior, b = -.23, p < .01, and moderates the serial mediation effect, 95% CI [-.04, -.01]. Pairwise contrasts between the conditional indirect effect further show that the moderated serial mediation effect is significantly different between the Gen Z with higher and lower conformities, 95% CI [-.06, -.01], supporting H3-1. In addition, the results show that habitual-cognitive (vs. emotional-social) motive does not result in higher task-relevant multi-tasking discussion behavior, b = .20, p = .61, rejecting H1-2. Higher task-relevant multi-tasking discussion behavior leads to greater perceived information diagnosticity, b = .24, p < .001, which leads to higher choice confidence, b = .24, p < .001, supporting H2-2. Finally, conformity does not interact with media multi-tasking motive on task-relevant multi-tasking discussion behavior, b = -.06, p = .55, and does not moderate the serial mediation effect, 95% CI [-.02, .01], rejecting H3-2. Discussion: The results show that conformity moderates the serial mediation effect of media multi-tasking motive, task-relevant multi-tasking search behavior, information diagnosticity, and choice confidence. For Gen Z with lower conformity, habitual-cognitive multi-taskers are more likely to conduct relevant search behavior while multi-tasking. They perceive higher information diagnosticity and have greater choice confidence than emotional social multi-taskers. Nonetheless, the serial mediation effect does not hold for Gen Z with higher conformity. The moderated serial mediation effect also does not hold for task-relevant multi-tasking discussion behavior. This study contributes to the existing literature in the following aspects. First, it explores the relationship between media multitasking motives and choice confidence of Gen Z to fill the knowledge gap. Second, this study demonstrates the applicability of the uses and gratification theory to studies of media multi-tasking of Gen Z. This study extends the one goal perspective of the uses and gratification theory by dividing it into one goal and a common goal in the context of media multi-tasking. One goal and a common goal result in lower and higher task-relevant media multi-tasking behaviors. Third, we integrate the uses and gratification theory, task repetition bias, uncertainty reduction theory, and diagnosticity-accessibility perspective to develop a proposed moderated serial mediation model. The model posits that conformity moderates the effect of media multi-tasking motive on choice confidence through the serial mediation of task-relevant multi-tasking search behavior and perceived information diagnosticity.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1651306746793,151,2022,Mass Communication Research
Fighting Like a Guerrilla: Dangwai Magazines in Political Archives Abstraction,Shun-Shing Huang,"alternative media, communications circuit, Dangwai magazines, freedom of the press, guerrilla media, white terror","Previous studies on Dangwai (non-Kuomintang) magazines can be divided into two categories: 1) verification of their political stance by analyzing the remarks of the magazines, and 2) an exploration of how Dangwai magazines promoted the development of Taiwan’s democratization. However, researchers have always overlooked the fact that Dangwai magazines were printed publications that need circulated and sold in the market. The content of any opinions and propositions had to be carried by the media, thus, solely discussing the content without examining the media appears biased. Moreover, analyses with an excessive focus on content merely present heroism, while ignoring the fact that the speech restraint that transcended the party-state system was overcome by numerous unsung heroes in the production of Dangwai magazines. The scholars argued that during the martial law period, intelligence units such as the Taiwan garrison command wantonly banned Dangwai magazines in order to hinder readers from purchasing such magazines, thereby preventing the dissemination of non-Kuomintang information. The inability of readers to access actual publications obstructed the spread and influence of radical speech and truth in the communication network, in turn rendering them incapable of swaying the readers’ and voters’ political intention and urging them to take action. Following the implementation of the Archives Act in 2002, the National Archives Administration has continuously acquired surveillance data targeting Dangwai magazines created by intelligence agencies through the deployment of informants. The purposes of these political archives are to learn the contents of the magazines in advance, verify the authors’ identities, and identify the operators involved in the production and publication of Dangwai magazines, enabling the government to expand its monitoring network and ban such magazines. Nevertheless, despite their original objectives in monitoring, these archives inadvertently left behind various details on the production of Dangwai magazines. This study employs the communication circuit by Darnton as the analytical framework, in which Dangwai magazines were regarded as the products of a long production process, thereby serving as the analysis basis for this batch of political archives. The production process of Dangwai magazines was not merely the materialization of ideas, it also involved labor production that required time, space, and considerable physical effort. By focusing on the working principle of “digging roots, cutting roots, and sweeping leaves” of the Taiwan garrison command, this study explains how the Taiwan garrison command conducted its banning operations. To ensure the successful banning of magazines, the Taiwan garrison command first adopted various methods to ambush informants in the targeted magazines and identify in advance details such as the content and authorship of the magazines, the location of their printing sites, their distribution channels, and the revenue of each issue. In addition to planting informants to acquire intelligence information, intelligence units also obtained relevant information through approaches such as monitoring telephone calls and intercepting fax information. The Taiwan garrison command could only conduct seizure operations at the magazine production sites, such as the plate making plants, printing plants, and binding factories after securing the aforementioned information. In order to ensure a watertight censorship of Dangwai magazines, the Taiwan garrison command also seized the vehicles transporting such magazines by establishing random checkpoints or standing guard outside retail bookstores to deter readers from making purchases. In response to the omnipresent official surveillance and banning operations, Dangwai magazines developed various guerrilla tactics to break through the government’s blockade. These included applying for multiple magazine registration certificates simultaneously to ensure the capacity to quickly publish another new magazine when one of the magazines was ordered to suspend publication, using multiple printing methods to reduce the number of magazines seized and ensure timely publication, and hand-delivering the magazines directly to the subscribers to break through the blockage of retail channels. The endeavors of these news workers in production and distribution who responded to the official censorship in a flexible way enabled Dangwai magazines to overcome the blockade and reach the readers, who were subsequently able to read and disseminate non nationalist information. The numerous surveillance archives and the evolution of censorship policies in the martial law era indicated that the authorities no longer targeted the authors, but rather a production line of Dangwai magazines to eliminate the source of ideologies. This exclusive production line outside the party developed into a strong and profitable industrial chain of Dangwai magazines around 1985. Through this exclusive production line, Dangwai magazines were able to engage in a guerrilla warfare against the party-state system while obtaining funds and readers from it. The authorities mobilized a large number of soldiers, police officers, and secret agents to wipe out Dangwai magazines in 1985, resulting in a banning rate of such magazines of up to 75.38%. The heavy financial losses suffered by the magazines led to operational difficulties and forced many of them to end their publications. Eventually, approximately only one issue of weekly magazine could be legally published every month. Thus, “breaking through speech regulation and striving for complete freedom of speech” depended not on the wisdom of the literati, but on the guerrilla tactics that consisted of ubiquitous, joint actions from upstream, midstream, and downstream operators, as well as on anonymous news workers in typesetting, printing, transportation, and retail. These combined efforts turned taboo speech, which was regarded as an ideological poison by the party-state system, into magazines that could be read and disseminated among the people. The aforementioned individuals were the behind-the-scene manipulators who were overlooked in previous studies, but had in fact influenced the survival of Dangwai magazines and their expression of opinions.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1651307042474,151,2022,Mass Communication Research
"Stimmung, Aura and Nothing: Intangible Media in 100 Flowers Hidden Deep",Guan-hua Huang,"100 Flowers Hidden Deep, aura, media, nothing, stimmung","This essay addresses the notions of ‘stimmung’, ‘aura’, and ‘nothing’ to summon up the presence of intangible media. By juxtaposing the readings of Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, and Jacques Lacan for interpreting Kaige Chen’s 100 Flowers Hidden Deep - a segment in the anthology film Ten Minutes Older: The Trumpet - the essay weaves the arguments of mediation through discussions of the comic theme and the animated scene of shan-shui audio-vision in Chen’s short film. The aim is to show how these three notions can be closely intertwined with the intangible sense of medium and to reveal the zero-degree dimension of spectrality that various forms of mediation - be they material, technical, or discursive - cannot convey. Chen’s 100 Flowers Hidden Deep is a whimsical comic fable on the ravages of Beijing’s urban modernization and the cultural memories of traditional local Hutong alleys. The film features a delusional elderly man, Mr. Fong, who is convinced his belongings still stand in the vacant lot where his residence used to be and so persuades workers to help him transport them to his new home. When the workers arrive at the specified location, however, they discover that the old man’s residence has already been demolished. The so-called 100 Flowers Hidden Deep becomes a lost place. The comic motif of “moving nothing” thus arises: upon further reflection the workers decide to humor the anachronistic man and help him move his non-existent possessions. After the play of moving nothing, Fong is disappointed except for finding a relic of the bell that used to hang from the roof of his house. The workers leave, but on the way of driving back, they find the clapper of that bell. When Fong puts them together, the film concludes by shifting from a realistic shot of the empty lot to an animated shan-shui painting of what is presumably Fong’s memory of his former home. In order for an in-depth analysis of the anachronistic existential relation between Fong and the workers that introduces the comic motif, I draw on the concept of stimmung in Heideggerian phenomenology to examine its function of mediation that implicitly determines our states of mind. For Heidegger, stimmung, as a primordial way of disclosing Being-in-the-world, attunes us ontologically to the world. In this sense, I contend that Heidegger’s account of stimmung not only explores the interplay of tradition/modernity, the past/the present, the virtual/the actual, and memory/reality in Chen’s film, but also brings about a more psychoanalytical light on the effects of comedy with regard to Fong’s “out-of-jointedness”, which indicates an uncanny excess of reality. Moreover, the incorporeal image of animation, making ephemerally present the spectral remainder of the lost 100 Flowers Hidden Deep, thus discloses for the workers the possibility of immersion in the stimmung of traditional Beijing. The effect of shan-shui animation when we view it as virtual surroundings in Fong’s past memories becomes the workers’ auratic presence, rendering communicable the long-forgotten cultural heritage. For an analysis of the aesthetic characteristic of shan-shui animation, the essay reflects upon the writings of Walter Benjamin and most especially his passages on aura and dialectical image, which provide the tools to understand the pivotal role of memory and image in relation to Benjamin’s redemption of history. Much has been addressed about the aura, particularly in relation to Benjamin’s most-quoted essay, ‘The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction’, in which aura is associated with the singular status of artwork - its unique existence in space and time. Rather than regarding the concept of aura as the traditional sense of full presence and authenticity, the essay argues that the notion of unconscious aura in Benjamin’s other texts allows us to link Proust’s “involuntary memories” to the analysis of shan-shui animation. In keeping with Benjamin’s perspective, it can be claimed that the aura of animation looks back, thus causing the workers to undergo an uncanny experience that indicates the possibility of encountering alterity. In other words, the unconscious aura runs parallel to the gaze in Lacanian psychoanalysis. Significantly, I suggest through the mode of auratic perception, like a medium in the sense of a diaphanous halo surrounding human beings, that the workers in the film, and we spectators as well, are allowed access to a fragment of lost time. The image of shan-shui animation in the form of irresolute vagueness should be paid more attention. In the last scene of the film, the shan-shui image is surfacing much like a dream or memory, with the effect of a nebulous atmosphere pervading the whole screen. In this regard, it seems to encompass the magical value of the aura that Benjamin refers to dialectical image. As such, I argue that the notions of unconscious aura and dialectical image formulate Benjamin’s messianic thinking of history, according to which the animated image of traditional Hutong alleys implies the redemptive power of memory. To pinpoint the significance of Chen’s artistic creation and his major concern for historical heritage, I focus on Lacan’s passage on the theory of art from his Seminar VII, which re-evaluates the Kantian notions of Thing and Sublime, in order to investigate the function of sublimation in artistic work. Sublimation is a concept central to psychoanalytic theories about art. In the text of Seminar VII, Lacan speaks of the fully developed definition of the term sublimation, which raises the object to the dignity of the Thing, and the formula of art, which is characterized by a certain mode of organization around the nothing (void, emptiness). By explicating the function of sublimation and the close relation between the Thing and the nothing in Lacan, I propose that the lost place, 100 Flowers Hidden Deep, is just the nothing that Chen creates and organizes the plot around, and the Thing-like shan-shui animation as the existence of the nothing designates the sublimatory moment when the memory of this lost place flashes up. As such, Chen’s act of creation undoubtedly echoes the ethical gesture of sublimation in Lacan’s sense, longing to find a new way to approach the Thing. At the core of my interpretation on 100 Flowers Hidden Deep, I conclude that the role of nothing with spectral materiality in psychoanalysis manifests itself in relation to the mediating aspects of stimmung in ontology and of aura in aesthetics and present the question of sublimation through which Chen’s work over the concern for historical heritage invites us to think.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1651307919949,151,2022,Mass Communication Research
Using AI BERT to Investigate the Framework of Taiwan News Media: A Case Study of the 2020 United States Presidential Election,"Lo Peiyi, Chiang Tosti Hsucheng","agenda setting, big data analysis, Google BERT, media bias, news framework","Background: The Taiwanese people are generally very concerned about U.S. presidential elections, but their views on them are different from most countries’ social phenomena. Past research has pointed out that the media’s discussion of the issues will affect the audience. Influence and other factors have prompted this study to take Taiwan news media as the analysis object, in view of the strategic and economic importance of the United States in regards to the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. How Taiwanese media present the issues of U.S. presidential elections are certainly worth exploring. Purpose: With the advancement of technology, more and more experiments expect to use technology to assist in research, and many researchers have begun to use computer programs to analyze data based on the advantages of big data. This study believes that the approach of big data research can help scholars sort out the topical framework of news media and understand the core meaning behind it. Therefore, this study compares the differences between the Google AI BERT model and manual classification, so as to confirm whether the error value between the latter and the former affects the research results, and proposes the verification results of the application of the classification model in the field of data analysis. RQ1: Using the Google AI BERT classification model for the 2020 U.S. presidential election report, what is the accuracy of the classified subject frame? RQ2: What thematic framework is used to reproduce the 2020 U.S. presidential election among different online news media? RQ3: What is the significance of the differences in the thematic framework of coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election between different online news media? Method: This study uses big data analysis to analyze texts and applies Python to scrutinize news frames to understand the meaning behind a large amount of information. In the end, 35,991 news samples in total were collected from seven online media firms. Reports of the U.S. presidential election have established five mutually exclusive categories: Game Framework, Strategy Framework, Issue Framework, China-Taiwan Relationship Framework, and Unrelated to Election. In this study, 3400 items were extracted from each of the five categories that were manually classified as the training dataset of the AI BERT model. The parameters were set as Batch size=16, learning rate=1e-5, and epoch=6, and the accuracy of the model training results was 84.48%. Thus, the study adopted this model as the classification model for subsequent studies. Findings: From the artificially encoded data in Figure 4 to Figure 10, it can be observed that only ETTV News has a relatively average reporting ratio among the news media, and the media’s “Game Framework” ratio is also the highest among the seven. In addition, in the “China-Taiwan Relationship Framework”, SET News, ETtoday News, Apple Daily, and LTN News are all over 30%, while SET News’ number of news related to the “China-Taiwan Relationship Framework” is even higher than 43%, or greater than that of other news media. This means that when SET News reports on the U.S. presidential election, it particularly focuses on content related to China or Taiwan. TVBS News, ETTV News, and UDN News accounted for nearly 25%, of which TVBS News accounted for only 22%. Among them, UDN News obviously focuses on “Issue Framework”, which accounts for 43%. In “Game Framework” media, SET News, Apple Daily, ETtoday News, UDN News, and LTN News accounted for only less than 10%. Implications: Cappella & Jamieson (1997) pointed out that one of the most common news conventions in political reporting is “game framing” that focuses on the struggle between politicians. Polling results attract readers to the news. However, different from most previous election news studies, this research focuses on how news media view foreign elections. The research results in Figures 4 to 10 present that the classification of manual coding is different from the ones often used in general election reports. For Competition Framework, Taiwanese media reporting on the news of the U.S. presidential election often employ the China-Taiwan Relationship Framework and Issue framework that relate to Taiwan’s own interests. Such research results are also in line with Nwokora et al. (2020) for Australia and the United Kingdom, which are also friendly countries with the United States. The mainstream media The Australian and Guardian in those two countries conducted news about U.S. President Trump, and their results of the analysis of the content of the reports are consistent. Compared with the general use of the Game Framework for domestic election reports, for foreign election news reports the Issue Framework that involves domestic interests is more often used. Regarding research question 2: What thematic framework is used to reproduce the 2020 U.S. presidential election among different online news media? This study finds that Taiwanese media did produce reports on foreign elections that are consistent with past research. The handling of foreign political news is not based on the Game Framework that is often used in domestic political news reports, but is presented in a news framework that is more relevant to national interests. There are also differences between different news media. In response to research question 3: What is the significance of the differences in the thematic framework of coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election between different online news media? Among the media discussed in this study, the news media with a more anti-China or pro-Green (DPP) stance are SET News, LTN News, and Apple Daily. Those whose political stance is more pro-China or pro-Blue (KMT) are UDN News, TVBS News, ETTV News, and ETtoday News. Past research has shown that these politically charged media outlets often suffer from bias when producing news (G. Rawnsley & M. Y. T. Rawnsley, 2012, Sullivan et al., 2018).",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1651308951970,151,2022,Mass Communication Research
"To Verify or Not To Verify, That is the Question: Newspaper Journalists’ Considerations of Daily News Verification","Chin-Chih, Chiang","context, daily news verification, expense of verification, future-oriented, news genre, source credibility","Verification is a core value of professional journalism, and especially in the digital age it adds significance to professional journalists. Canter (2014) found that local British journalists regarded themselves as “verifiers of news”, yet according to previous publications, journalists in daily news production neither spend much time nor put lots of effort into verifying like the public expects. There are several reasons for that - namely, journalists do not have enough financial and time resources, they are familiar with and trust their sources, and what journalists need is relatively accurate information and not an absolute truth. Despite that, journalists do not ignore the importance of news verification, as they still verify while producing daily news. Journalists in theory should verify the source of the content and the content itself independently (Brandtzaeg, Lüders, Spangenberg, Rath-Wiggins & Følstad, 2016, p. 325), but in daily news production, source verification is the key (Barnoy & Reich, 2020, Rauchfleisch, Artho, Metag, Post & Schäfer, 2017). Furthermore, because journalists rely heavily on their regular authoritative sources in daily news production, source credibility becomes a practical mechanism that helps them decide whether or not to verify (Reich, 2011a). However, Reich (2011b) also pointed out that source credibility does not fully explain why journalists decide to cross-check their information. A review of the literature on this topic indicates that when journalists decide whether to verify or not, they tend to consider three major contextual factors: news genre constraints, content characteristics, and source authority and credibility. However, it is worth noting that a journalist’s decision is not only context-dependent, but also highly dynamic. Until now, there has been scant research on how journalists consider the interwoven contexts and how they regard news verification as a future-oriented task. Therefore, by focusing on daily news production, this study aims to explore journalists’ practical consideration of multiple contexts when they decide whether to verify or not. The data of this study comes from a research project that aims to examine, in daily news production, how journalists decide to verify, their consideration and verification practices, and how news organizations establish their verification routines and norms. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 editorial supervisors and journalists specializing in politics, judiciary, or finance in Taiwan’s four major newspapers. All interviews were conducted between the middle of April 2018 and the beginning of July 2019. Each interview was approximately 2 hours in length, and all were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The purpose of this study is to explore in daily news production the journalists’ consideration and decision about whether to verify or not, and so we focused on the data from the 25 interviewed journalists. The interviewees were asked to classify the information which they decide to use in their news articles into three types: the information they have to verify, information that does not need verification, and the information they could decide either way. The researcher then asked them to give examples of each information type to elaborate on their reasons and the various contexts they took into consideration. There are three main findings in this article as follows. First, this study reveals that journalists’ decision about whether to verify is based on weighing the expense of verification (time, cognitive processing, and interpersonal pressures), the benefit of the news (importance or impact of the news), and the risk of lacking full verification (it might cause a negative impact on society, their news organization, and the journalists themselves). Therefore, the higher benefit and risk a news article has, the higher the probability is that journalists will start verifying. On the other hand, when the expense of verifying is negligible, journalists are inclined to regard news verification as part of information gathering and proceed with verification while gathering information. Second, in addition to news genre constraints, source authority, and content characteristics influencing journalists’ decision about verifying or not, this study finds that journalists tend not to verify content if it is similar to previously acquired information. Furthermore, this study emphasizes that the contextual factors are not independent, but interwoven and affected by the expense of verification, the impact of the news, and the risk of lacking full verification as mentioned above. For example, in daily news production, one of the reasons, as stated in previous literature, that journalists skip verifying the information offered by their authoritative sources is the sources’ authority and credibility. However, there are four other practical considerations as follows: (1) Journalists tend to believe that authoritative sources will avoid the negative impact of offering incorrect or fake information to journalists. If journalists can use authoritative sources’ names in news articles, it will especially transfer the responsibility of verification to the source, and journalists can avoid the risk of being sued and being accused of lacking verification. (2) With limited time, the authoritative source might be the only one that journalists can reach for help to verify. (3) The information that authoritative sources provide to all journalists is not exclusive, and it can always be used with the sources’ names, and so the news benefit and risks are low. (4) Journalists do not verify news that is beneficial to authoritative sources, because both its newsworthiness and its risk are low, and it might contribute to developing a good relationship with the authoritative sources. Third, this study emphasizes that verification, as an action, is future-oriented. We find that journalists might continue verifying even after some news articles have been published. This is because, in the process of news verification, journalists can continue to develop news stories as well as accumulate their domain and situational knowledge, especially their perception of authoritative sources’ authority and credibility. All such factors can help them to reduce the expense of verification in the future. Our findings contribute to new knowledge on how journalists regard news verification as a future-oriented task and how journalists consider multiple contexts when they decide whether to verify or not. We suggest future research could explore the impact of field characteristics and journalists’ experiences on journalists’ verification decisions or use discourse analysis to study how journalists specializing in different fields employ discourse techniques to construct evidence.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1658928300063,152,2022,Mass Communication Research
Creativity in New Media: How to Turn Adversity Into Opportunity,"Wendy Chan Wing Lam, Pui Ho Fai, Fred","journalism, journalistic creativity, journalists, media creativity, new media","The models and ecology of the media industry are different in today’s society, as it is not easy to grab the public’s attention. It is even harder to get people in big data era to make the first few items of social media their own content, thus pushing media creativity to greater importance. The analysis of media creativity in this research falls into two parts. First, under the new media era, this study aims to find out the environmental factors that make media practitioners gradually turn to use creativity. Second, we delve into if and how creativity takes different forms under new media and traditional media. All interviews for this study were conducted in the second half of 2020, and the interviewees can be roughly divided into three groups. The first group is leaders in the industry who have 5 to 10 years or more of work experience in the media industry. The second group covers those who are awardees and who have been recognized at international competitions. The third group is young journalists who work in traditional and online media. From relatively experienced young journalists to award-winning journalists and even frontline media professionals, their experiences form a more rounded version of the term media creativity. This research analyzes the advancement of the creative concept of news media, so as to see the direction of the development of creativity in news media. The findings indicate that the three key aspects that foster journalists’ creativity are individuals, society, and the workplace environment, which are emphasized throughout this article. The interviewees note the ability for the new generation of journalists to interview and write independently. Journalists’ competences in applied technology, knowledge of using new media, and their professional knowledge are all crucial. At the same time, if the media’s management lacks the mentality to embrace new technology, then it will restrict reporters’ incentive for embarking on creativity. The environment in the new media era is, on the other hand, extremely competitive, because there are several channels for the general public to access information. Media professionals must first consider why the general public would find certain content interesting. In order to engage readers, practitioners need to find intriguing ways to provide uninteresting news in a manner that is simple to understand. At the same time, the new media environment offers social media platforms, numerous new tools, and applications that are simple to use. The reporters’ creative capability is made simpler by all of these factors. The 15 interviewees feel that their work environment, including the company’s culture, resources, and encouragement of innovation, is highly essential to them. Hong Kong’s conventional media have been reluctant to change, as it is not possible to instantly upgrade this working model, which has been in use for decades. In recent years, the working atmosphere at news companies has also gotten worse. The economic crisis has had an impact on many of Hong Kong’s traditional news outlets, and there is not much money available to invest in new technologies or give journalists the tools they need to express their creativity. They are thus unable to properly express their creativity, despite the presence of others and the encouragement of their social surroundings. The interactions among people, society, and the workplace are also beneficial for media innovation. The interviewees reveal how important the three are, because society as a whole is still reliant on new media. It is also simpler for everyone to be creative with technology, which might draw people’s attention and bring more people to a news platform. To boost sales of their advertisements, media companies need to generate the traffic. Naturally, additional resources are allocated to media innovation. For media practitioners, the new media is just a platform. Everyone is trying to convert the advantages of the platform into their own advantages, but it is easy to talk about it than successfully doing it. This article also points out that although a small number of media practitioners still resists the word “creativity”, some respondents confirm the existence and application of creativity, in the hope of bringing out the importance of the word “creativity” to the field of media through this research. This study identifies six key factors that affect whether journalists will apply creativity in their work: the ever-changing needs of information by society, the industry’s transformation, the career aspirations of media practitioners, the resources given by a company, pressure within a company, and fulfilling readers’ expectation. These key factors could further be included into a future quantitative study to test the correlations and interactions between each factor and also the dependent factor of media creativity.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1658928833675,152,2022,Mass Communication Research
The Intermedia Agenda-Setting Effects between Party News Media and Commercial News Media: A Study of Weibo Hot Issues from 2013 to 2020,"Su Ting, Huiping Huang","commercial news media, cross-lagged analysis, intermedia agenda setting, network agenda setting, party news media, QAP (quadratic assignment procedure)","Background: Following the guidance of revolutionary experiences and the Marxist-Leninist theory of journalism, the news media have long been regarded as a propaganda apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. However, after the reform and opening-up policy in 1978, two different types of media, party news media and commercial news media, have emerged and shown different coverage patterns. With the development of Internet technology, the media in China have also undergone tremendous changes. Social media like Sina Weibo have become a collaborative network of content production for information sources. Both party news media and commercial news media need to engage in social media platforms to attract the audience. Literature Review: News media can shape public opinion by underscoring the salience of certain issues, which is known as agenda setting. By selecting issues and attributes, the media further construct a network of objects and attributes, and the salience of network relationships can also be transferred from the media to the public. In other words, the news media not only tell us “what to think” or “how to think”, but also determine how audience members connect different pieces of information to construct their perceptions and judgments of social phenomena. This is called the network agenda setting (NAS) effect. Moreover, while intermedia agenda setting focuses on the interactions between different types of media and the relationships of agenda setting, NAS effects may also occur between different types of media. This study thus incorporates NAS and intermedia agenda setting theories to test the differences and relationships between China’s party news media and commercial news media in their Weibo coverage of eight hot issues from 2013 to 2020. Using this longitudinal perspective, this study presents a more comprehensive media landscape in today’s China. Research Purpose and Questions: This study aims to break through the limitations of previous literature on a single issue at a single time. It investigates the agenda setting effects between party news media and commercial news media with a long-term vision. It first examines the content, frequencies, and attributes of news coverage on hot issues of the two types of media in recent years and proposes the first research question. RQ1: What are the attributes and characteristics of the hot issues by the party media and the commercial news media from 2013 to 2020? It then analyzes the relationships between the party news media and the commercial news media and tests whether the cross-media agenda setting theory is valid in China’s particular media environment. The second research question is proposed as follows. RQ2: What is the intermedia agenda setting relationship between the party media and the commercial news media in the hot issues from 2013 to 2020? Method: This study selects People’s Daily as representative of party news media and The Beijing News as representative of commercial news media. It collects 1,545 microblogs on Sina Weibo from People’s Daily and 711 microblogs from The Beijing News, making a total of 2,256 microblogs. According to the attributes of eight different events from 2013 to 2020, the study codes these microblogs and presents the co-occurrence matrices based on Python language. It then uses QAP (quadratic assignm mination, further opening up a possibility of alternative news reporting for the public. Results: Evidence reveals a strong correlation between the two types of media in terms of network agenda attributes. Further analysis shows that People’s Daily set the agenda of The Beijing News for the explosion accident in Tianjin Binhai New Area in 2015, “two sessions” (the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]) in 2018, and the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC in 2019. However, for the “Problematic Vaccine” scandal in Shandong in 2016, The Beijing News set the agenda of People’s Daily. The results demonstrate that although China’s controlled media environment is dominated by party news media, commercial news media still is able to set the agenda of party news media for some particular issues concerning social and people’s livelihood. Discussion: This study is the first longitudinal one that combines theories of network agenda setting and intermedia agenda setting to investigate the attributes and the relationships of agenda setting effects of different types of news media. It explores the network agenda setting and intermedia agenda setting effects across party news media and commercial news media in China. This study also uses QAP analysis and cross-lagged analysis to test the direction of network agenda setting, demonstrating its methodological value. Overall, the results offer a picture of party news media and commercial news media in China’s new media era and discover that commercial news media still have voices that may shake the party news media’s do Background: Following the guidance of revolutionary experiences and the Marxist-Leninist theory of journalism, the news media have long been regarded as a propaganda apparatus of the Chinese Communist Party since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949.

"Virus, Information, and Society:Observation of Infodemic Using Luhmann’s Social Systems Theory",Wei-San Sun,"infodemic, Luhmann, misinformation, social systems theory","Research background: The new coronavirus (COVID-19) has brought about two epidemics: one physical and the other informational. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines infodemic as “a tsunami of information—some accurate, some not—that spreads alongside an epidemic....... an infodemic can have direct negative impacts on the health of populations and the public health response...... infodemics hinder the cohesiveness of societies by increasing existing social inequities, stigma, gender disparity and generational rift.” Amidst the uncertainties brought about by the pandemic, COVID-related misinformation has run wild just as much as the virus. This chaotic communication phenomenon has not been charted theoretically in communication studies thus far as most studies are limited to a phenomenal level. This study identifies three major approaches to tackle this problem in the academic arena. First, the health communication approach, typified by WHO’s endeavors, is to rectify misinformation by providing scientific evidence, hoping that science and reason prevail over misinformation as the dominant theme of social communication. Second, big data analyses have adopted a technical approach to trace the footprints of misinformation and reveal patterns of how misinformation spreads on social platforms and the scope of its seriousness. Third, geopolitical studies, political think tanks, and international human rights advocates seek to unveil the whos and whys behind misinformation by documenting certain social or political groups’ and regimes’ misinformation operations. Although fruitful, research efforts thus far have not provided a conceptual framework to make sense of the infodemic phenomenon as well as its deep-rooted societal problems at an abstract level. Research purpose: Using social systems theory as a conceptual framework to analyze the infodemic phenomenon. Research questions: This study situates the infodemic scenario within a broader matrix of diverse relations between information and societies and aims to answer the following questions. If the virus’ threat toward human health is a fact, then why do different social groups react to the virus so contrarily? If information can be determined as true or false, then why is misinformation being continuously reproduced, spread, and even supported? What does one make of the relations among the virus, information, and society? Research method: This study uses sociologist Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory as the conceptual tool, as well as the study’s worldview, to analyze the infodemic phenomenon. It first introduces Luhmann’s concept of observation, autopoiesis, communication, system differentiation, and system contradiction and conflict and then uses these concepts to observe the diverse relationships between information and societies within the pandemic. This research deems Luhmann’s systems theory an adequate conceptual model for the subject as it conceives society as a complex conglomerate of differences instead of an aggregation of consensus. Research results: This study concludes with four propositions. (1) The semantic of infodemic does not reflect an objective phenomenon, instead, it is a construction out of frustrated observations projected by nation-states that find themselves unable to steer the themes of social communication both within and over their boundaries. According to Luhmann, there is only one society in the modern world, the world society, which presents itself as the horizon of all possible themes of communication. Infodemic reflects a frustration in which nation-states find that the disparity between reality and an ideal civic society is getting wider. (2) Luhmann conceives social systems as differences, systems differentiate themselves from the environment and use the distinctions self-referentially to recognize information with which to construct communication on which the systems exist. As a result, different systems apply different distinctions to construct information pertaining to their own autopoietic reproduction. This explains why different social groups would have very different responses to an otherwise physically harmful virus. (3) In Luhmann’s communication concept, information is not the message transmitted between sender and receiver, but a selection among participants who share the information as a resource for system reproduction. Thus, a message, be it true or false and as long as it is meaningful for an observation system’s reproduction, is deemed useful information. This explains why pieces of misinformation can be continually reproduced, shared, and supported. (4) Misinformation, and thus infodemic, emerges as various systems utilize different distinctions to construct diverse observations and communications. From the perspective of first-order observation, a system calls a message misinformation if the message violates its own meaning constitution. However, from the perspective of second-order observation (i.e., observing how a system observes), one can see that misinformation is a system’s communication labeling another system’s communication. It takes at least two systems involved in a contradictory or conflicting relation to realize misinformation being labelled. On the level of second-order observation, there can be no true or false information, only different information. Under the characteristics of the diversity of modern society, accusations of misinformation will become rampant as contradictory and conflicting system relations prevail. Originality/value: Luhmann’s systems theory not only provides a conceptual framework for observing the infodemic phenomenon and its deep-rooted societal problems, but also enables us to see the other side that previous research methods do not - the side of unscientific and anti-democratic communications that nevertheless also make up parts of the social world.",https://mcr.nccu.edu.tw/web/backissues/../backissues/backissues_in.jsp?pp_no=PP1658930481042,152,2022,Mass Communication Research
Rethinking Ecological Perspectives: The Relational Network between Human and Non-human in Indigenous Social Work in Taiwan,Hsiang-I Teng,"cultural care, green social work, ecological perspectives, indigenous peoples","The article is concerned the development of Indigenous Social Work theory related to Cultural Care in Taiwan. Based on discourses on the starting point, such as cultural competence, cultural safety, cultural translation, cultural sovereignty and historical trauma, this abstract aims at creating a dialogue with an ecological approach and social work perspective while dealing with problem solving. Currently, social workers seeking an understanding of persons' situations are focusing on the relationship between human and human, or with an interest in environmental trauma affected by climate change. This paper is rises above these concerns to explore the relationship network between human and non-human via an indigenous worldview, and also aims to achieve a coexistence ecological system approach to cross-species care and co-work. The practical field example is millet as a non-human species to create a relational recovery and connection from the indigenous point of view of ecological perspective discourse.

The in-depth interview method was conducted with 6 care givers and 7 adolescents from a residential care facility. The research results applied to three situations: application for going out, mobile phone use, and activity participation. The principles of ＂the Right of Child to be Heard＂ were summarized, including: listening and respecting, active communication, empowerment, individualization, and team consensus. In addition, the practical actions include: (1) enhancing children's ability to deal with violations by different methods; (2) seeking reasonable adjustments to the family rules via discussion and dialogue; (3) designing multiple participation mechanisms to adjust the family rules; (4) discussing the issues of daily living; (5) providing different choices to increase the opportunities of decision-making; (6) enhancing children to reflect their opinions to key person. Based on these finding, suggestions for future practice include: (1) planning a regular supervision and training system to create a friendly space for dialogue; (2) continuing to adjust the relationship and communication between caregivers and children; (3) creating a child-based dialogue space; (4) identifying the factors that may limit the implementation of rights.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202212-202212260004-202212260004-33-81,46,2022,NTU Social Work Review
"Aging in Place Factors, External Continuity and Quality of Life among Older Adults in Cities: Taipei City Taken as an Example","Chin-Yi Su, Shiau-Fang Chao","quality of life, path analysis, aging in place, continuity theory, aging friendly cities","＂Aging in place＂ has long been a popular and desirable term in regard to improving quality of life (QOL) among older adults. However, most extant studies only focus on certain aspects instead of viewing aging in place inclusively from its three elemental definitions: being safe at home, maintaining autonomy, and enjoying an aging-friendly community. Furthermore, less is known about how continuity of daily lives potentially affects older adults' QOL. Integrating the Environmental Press Theory and the Continuity Theory, this study evaluates how aging in place elements and external continuity of city-dwelling older adults combine in affacting their quality of life. 253 adults aged 60 and above were recruited. The sample was not representative of community-dwelling older adults in Taipei city. A structed questionnaire was carried out either by paper-and-pencil or an online survey. The results showed that, firstly, home safety, autonomy and aging-friendly community all positively affect QOL, with the latter two elements having stronger effects. Secondly, the stability of personal relationships and activity continuity not only showed strong effects related to QOL, but also served as mediators between autonomy, aging-friendly community and QOL. This study urges that in putting aging in place into a more active practice, policy makers and social workers should not only evaluate the situation of home safety, autonomy and aging-friendly community of older adults, but also pay attention to their external continuity, which entails maintaining their long-term relationship with the local community and preserving their own daily routines. To achieve higher QOL among older adults, related organizations could be more proactive to empower older people to become agents of their own communities and city spaces.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202212-202212260004-202212260004-83-125,46,2022,NTU Social Work Review
＂I am a Volunteer; I Earn Respect!＂ Analyzing Empowering Experiences of Female New Immigrants for Participating in Volunteering Services in Taiwan,Yi-Han Wang,"volunteering, service center for new immigrant family, female new immigrant volunteer, empowering","Volunteering is related to empowerment; the concept of empowerment contains multiple dimensions and refers to an empowering process as well as empowered result. Adopting the empowerment framework proposed by Parsons, this article explores female new immigrants' volunteering experiences in the service center for new immigrant families (SCNIFs). Based on 28 in-depth interviews, three empowerment categories are identified: 1. Personal empowerment through believing in one's own abilities, improving self-esteem, and increasing self-awareness and self-acceptance; 2. Interpersonal empowerment of accumulating resources, setting limits on giving, using resources to solve problems, and interacting with others with assertiveness; 3. Community/Political empowerment of giving back by volunteering at SCNIFs, and removing stigma and earning respect. It is further found that volunteering, which embraces empowering elements, is an important means of social participation for female new immigrants to negotiate their multiple inferior situations within Taiwanese society. Besides, employing Parsons's framework to examine these female new immigrant volunteers' components and dimensions of empowerment, this article further reveals that these female volunteers mainly get their power by developing positive self-perception and improving their abilities, but rarely striving for rights or changing the unfair system. In other words, the empowerment of female new immigrant volunteers is still in the process stage.

We explored intersectional life experiences of sexual stigma and HIV stigma, and how gay men living with HIV coped with intersectional stigma. Results: The results revealed that our participants internalized negative attitudes related to sexual stigma, which impacted their willingness to come out. When they came out as gay men, they still held expectations that society would exhibit positive images of being gay men. Secondly, being gay men living with HIV could possibly generate stress from intersectional stigma due to the impression that living with HIV would lead to deteriorating masculinity, which includes independence, health, and strength. Thirdly, participants who held strong sexual stigma also indicated strong HIV-related stigma. Coping strategies for intersectional stigma across the personal level (positive reframing and active avoidance), interpersonal level (social support from both HIV or non-HIV networks) and societal level (active action and searching for friendly healthcare network).

At present, all 22 municipalities in Taiwan have organized ＂children's representatives＂ who may participate in local governance and offer their collective voice on policies affecting children. This article starts by overviewing the rights to be heard and participate, as guaranteed by article 12 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is followed by a summary of the research results gathered from in-depth interviews and a focused group interview with municipal children's representatives. This article makes the following recommendations, encompassing the core values of diversity and child-friendliness, to enable children's representatives to engage in a meaningful way with their local governance debate and decision-making processes. (1) The emphasis on raising proposals neglects the needs of children's representatives with special needs or vulnerable backgrounds. The government is recommended to allow children's representatives to make their views heard in more diverse ways. (2) The government should rethink the focus of its evaluation and monitoring approaches for this participation mechanism. Instead, children's representatives' self-worth and self-esteem, whether their views are taken seriously and the impact of their participation, should all be considered as potential outcome indicators. The exchange of information and transparency between adult and children's representatives should be strengthened, in order to cultivate an environment of mutual respect among participants.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202206-202206130006-202206130006-1-44,45,2022,NTU Social Work Review
＂Why Is It Only Me?＂: Obedience and Confrontation When Adult Siblings Inherit the Family Caregiver Role,"Gian-Yuan Fan, Chen-Fen Chen","caregivers, siblings, intellectual disability, inheritance","This study explores the factors that influence families with intellectual disabilities in choosing specific siblings to inherit the main care responsibilities, as well as the coping strategies from the perspective of the main sibling caregiver. Using the in-depth interview method, we interviewed 10 sibling caregivers of patients with intellectual disabilities in nine families. The study has two main findings. First, the interaction of ＂parents' appointment＂ and ＂the gap in the opportunity to participate in care of siblings＂ is the main reason for the success of the main sibling caregivers. In other words, this gap in opportunity is not innate; it is the long-term close interaction between the parents and their heirs, excluding or ignoring the effects of other siblings. Second, the main sibling caregivers have three coping strategy patterns: most obedient, less confrontational, and rare voices. One of the main sibling caregivers gradually tries to develop their personal resources and knowledge and challenges parental and mainstream societal expectations in an attempt to influence their care fate. We propose three suggestions: First, service organizations can conduct narrative-oriented sibling workshops to help siblings to look back on growth experiences and develop coping strategies that take care of both career planning and care responsibilities, as well as to give them the opportunity to reinterpret and construct new experiences to promote change. Second, the government and organizations can create care arrangement guidelines for encouraging all family members to take part in discussing the intellectually disabled sibling's care plans together and joining the care arrangement, in order to avoid the single inheritance situation. Finally, provide a multivariate caregiver support service program and carry out care transfer planning and support services in advance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202206-202206130006-202206130006-45-88,45,2022,NTU Social Work Review
Factors Contributing to Quality Co-parenting after Divorce,"Chih-Yen Cheng, April Chiung-Tao Shen","forgiveness, divorced parents, co-parenting, visitation arrangement, parenting collaboration","Based on system theory, this study aims to investigate the factors contributing to quality co-parenting after divorce. Co-parenting after divorce refers to the relationship of divorced parents continuing to participate in child rearing, i.e., a high quality co-parental relationship combined with low inter-parental conflict and high mutual support. This study used a self-reporting questionnaire to collect data from 136 participants who had been divorced for at least one year and were raising children under 20 years of age. Participants were recruited from family case service centers in family courts all over Taiwan, social media, and a recruitment advertisement placed in Household Registration Office. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were utilized to test the effect of 6 factors: forgiveness, expectations of post-divorce co-parenting, level of hostility between divorced parents, satisfaction with child financial support, satisfaction with visiting arrangement, and satisfaction with custody arrangements on quality of co-parental interaction after divorce. The control variables include county of residence, gender of the parents, length of the marriage, length of the divorce, the divorce procedure, average monthly income of the parents, highest education level the parents attained, age of the children, children's living and custody arrangement, and parent-child closeness. The research results show that on average, the support between divorced parents was low, and that the divorced parents had occasional conflicts. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that satisfaction with visiting arrangement, closeness between the ex-spouse and the children, and forgiveness were the significant predictors of quality co-parenting between divorced parents. In other words, the more that the divorced parents were satisfied with the child's visiting arrangement, the more closeness the relationship between the child and ex-spouse, and the more forgiveness between the divorced parents, the better the quality of co-parental interactions between the divorced parents.

A Preliminary Study on Local Practice of Community Music Care: Taking Penghu Community as an Example,Liang-Ru Lin,"community music care, music care, music therapy, community music therapy","Based on the experience gained from local practices in Penghu Community, this study found that only two music care activities can serve as bridges for community connections: music care activities tailored for the community and the training of local volunteers for these activities. Integrating theories and practices of music therapy, music care, and community music therapy, this study is the first one of its kind that proposed the concept of ＂community music care＂ and applied the seven aspects of community music therapy ＂PREPARE＂ as a reference framework to its execution. Because this study was in the preliminary stage; therefore, the participatory observation method was adopted. The observation revealed that, in the process of volunteer training and leading of activities, all the other six aspects of ＂PREPARE＂ were workable in the practice of community music care except the A (Activist) aspect, which was not obvious in the practice. Developed from a single ＂music care＂ activity, the ＂community music care＂ is more closely related to the community and has provided broader thinking space and more practice directions for music care. Through numerous practices, the volunteers gradually found ways to interact sincerely with the community elders. By designing activities for the community music care, we can train local volunteers to become the foundation for the development of a healthy community.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202206-202206130006-202206130006-133-170,45,2022,NTU Social Work Review
System debugging? Individual blame? Serious Case Reviews of Child Maltreatment Fatalities in Taiwan,Shu-Chiung Liu,"child death review, risk management, Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), child abuse and neglect fatalities, child abuse","Serious child abuse presents an unbearable weight for human rights protection. Serious Case Reviews (SCRs) in child abuse are risk management mechanisms to identify risk factors, facilitate system improvements and correction, and prevent recurrences. This paper reviews domestic and international literature on risk management mechanisms of serious child abuse cases from three dimensions: structure, processes, and outcome. The empirical data, generated by two waves of child protection social workers focus group and interviews, describe, and compare the longitudinal internal and external dynamics of SCRs, patterns of practice, and practitioners' attitude, as well as the potential consequences in Taiwan. Specific recommendations for policies and procedures have been made. The SCRs, at both the local and central government levels, have realized that discussions and decisions were made without sufficient information. Although the perceived finger-pointing and fault-finding culture has decreased, the discussions and resolutions are still focusing on scrutinizing individual social worker's practice, while the system improvement opportunities, such as resources allocation and interagency collaboration, are lost. At the policy level, this paper recommends that the government adopt a holistic approach to examine institutional and systemwide root causes for undesirable outcomes, and develop a plan of action accordingly. At the professional practice level, this paper recommends that cases with specific characteristics be identified and selected each year for a systematic in-depth analysis whose objective is to share the knowledge gained and lessons learned from SCRs with frontline child protection workers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202112-202112300006-202112300006-1-44,44,2021,NTU Social Work Review
Rebuilding Social Support Network of Substance Abusers: A Qualitative Inquiry into the Services in Faith-based Residential Treatment Centers,Yih-Tsu Hahn,"therapeutic community, recovery, social support network, faith-based treatment for addiction, treatment for substance abuse","Objectives: Substance abuse treatments are gradually replacing incarceration with multiple, longitudinal treatment arrangements in Taiwan. Few studies have been conducted on how substance abusers are guided in rebuilding social support networks during recovery. The purpose of this study was to investigate social support network implications of services for recovery in nonprofit residential treatment centers. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative research design, and conducted three focus-group interviews with 13 living care assistants, social workers and directors from 8 residential centers. The interview data were converted into transcripts for analysis with Nvivo12. Results: The social support network implications of services for recovery include four dimensions: rebuilding new connections with people in the centers, reframing original connections with family members, extending outside connections with people outside the centers, and enhancing collaboration of peer workers and professional workers. Conclusions: It is recommended that residential treatment centers increase resources on services of social support network for abstinence. Peer support services are valuable in the service model. Specific services for female substance abusers and their families are needed in the treatment procedures. Policy should evaluate the subsidy requirements linked to education level to encourage people with recovery experiences to remain as peer workers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202112-202112300006-202112300006-45-84,44,2021,NTU Social Work Review
Factors Associated with the Quality of Life Among People with Facial Disfigurement: Evidence from the Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation,"Chao-Yin Lin, Yi-Chun Chou, Shu-ling Liu","facial disfigurement, quality of life, social support, social participation, disability acceptance","Purpose: The face has important meanings for people. Facial disfigurement may have comprehensive impacts on people both physically and psychologically, as well as in social relations, thereby influencing the overall quality of life. Nevertheless, systematic research related to the quality of life among people with facial disfigurement is still extremely limited in Taiwan. The individual/ medical model and social model in disability studies were applied to explain the level of quality of life among people with facial disfigurement in this study. Methods: This study conducted a representative population-based survey in 2015 through face-to-face interviews involving 304 people with facial disfigurement. The interviewees were randomly sampled from the service users of the Sunshine Social Welfare Foundation. The concept of quality of life was measured by the WHOQOL-BREF (Taiwanese version), and factors associated with quality of life were divided into three groups: demographic backgrounds, facial impairment factors, and social environment factors. Descriptive statistics, ordinal logistic regression and multiple regression analyses were employed to present the features and factors associated with quality of life. Results: Compared to the findings drawn from the general population in Taiwan and people with facial disfigurement in the U.K. and Turkey administered with the same questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF), the level of quality of life among our respondents was relatively lower. Regarding factors associated with their quality of life, the type and degree of facial disfigurement was significantly related to the physical domain; the variables of social support and social participation were significantly related to the four domains of quality of life. However, demographic variables were less significantly related to the quality of life as determined in the present study. Conclusions: The results of this study were found to be similar to those in the related literature; social support and social participation were constructive factors leading to the improvement of quality of life among people with facial disfigurement.

In order to achieve the above aims, this study was conducted with qualitative research methods, and purposefully invited representative experts, scholars, administrators and practitioners in the public and private sectors to conduct individual in-depth interviews and focus groups. The research results show that ＂Long-term Care 1.0＂ and ＂Long-term Care 2.0＂ have six advantages and seven disadvantages. According to these findings, this study puts forward six relevant suggestions for promoting ＂community-based＂ long-term care services from the perspective of network governance, including: (1) Enhancing the network's awareness of partnerships to create a niche for long-term care network governance; (2) Strengthening the mechanism of cross-departmental and cross-professional integration and coordination; (3) Introducing the ＂person-centered＂ concept to stimulate the motivation of stakeholders to participate in the network; (4) Allocating resources appropriately and simplifying administrative procedures and promoting the governance consensus; (5) Exploring and making good use of resources inside and outside the community to strengthen the energy directed at community care; (6) Strengthening investment in care services in remote areas to improve the quality and quantity of services.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202112-202112300006-202112300006-133-173,44,2021,NTU Social Work Review
Challenges and Coping Strategies among Indigenous Gay People in Facing Intersectionality,"Ciwang Teyra, Chao-Kai Huang, Wan-Jung (Wendy","social support, indigenous people, Intersectionality, LGBTQ individuals, discrimination","Background: With the legalization of Same-Sex Marriage in Taiwan, the LGBTQ population and its related issues have gradually gained public attention. Specifically, the indigenous LGBTQ groups experience more severe challenges by encountering the intersectionality of racial and gender discrimination in daily lives. With only a few existing studies regarding the indigenous LGBTQ population in Taiwan, this research aims to fulfill the gap by exploring their life challenges, coping strategies, and resilience factors with an intersectionality perspective. Method/Analysis: This study collaborated with the Taiwan Indigenous LGBTQ Alliance, conducting in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 indigenous gay men who reside in various regions of Taiwan. We employed an inductive thematic analysis approach to analyze transcripts. This approach involved both within and cross-case analysis to identify major themes. The findings were reviewed by the core members of the Taiwan Indigenous LGBTQ Alliance to establish cultural validity. Findings: Many indigenous gay men experienced the intersectionality of racial discrimination, gender identity/ sexual orientation discrimination, and stigmas of religion, class, and SES status during their growths, which is different from the experiences of the general LGBTQ group in Taiwan. To respond to these challenges, indigenous gay men developed several coping strategies. Specifically, they would be actively involved in tribal public affairs and services, kept a proper physical distance from the tribal communities, made connections within the indigenous LGBTQ group, and sought for higher socioeconomic status (SES) to increase a sense of security. Conclusion: This study suggests that more future research about indigenous LGBTQ persons in Taiwan is needed. This study also indicates that more resources are required in order to support indigenous LGBTQ persons and their parents to cope with stress about coming-out, to explore their inner strengths and resilience, and to facilitate dialogues within the tribe. These practices and supports will be critical to reduce further oppression among this population and promote their wellbeing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202106-202107130008-202107130008-1-53,43,2021,NTU Social Work Review
Exploring Occupational Health Hazards and Protection Mechanism in the Disability Welfare Institution: Focus on Educare Givers,Su-Fen You,"occupational health hazard, educare giver, the disability welfare institution, risk communication, assistive device","While the work process of caregivers in disability institutions entails numerous occupational health risks, Taiwan's society rarely pays attention to this issue. Based on the case study and qualitative research, this study explores the occupational health hazards, risk communication and protection mechanisms for educare givers in a disability welfare institution. The research institution in this study is an agency located in southern Taiwan, with the focus on the adult department and preschool department. We collected data through participatory observation and in-depth interviews. In terms of the results of the study, the educare givers are threatened by occupational disasters, despite the case institution's history of excellent performance as reflected in its evaluation results. It is also noteworthy that the institutional management attaches great importance to employee health and risk communication. However, the protection mechanism against occupational health hazards apparently has not been effectively implemented. From the perspective of human resources management, some mechanisms of the organization need to be strengthened, including: education and training need to include more topics related to occupational health and safety, health promotion programs should collect occupational injury and disease information, develop the requisite measures to facilitate employees' compliance with health and safety requirements, etc. In addition, the case institution does not even use any transfer device. This study calls for the ＂No-lift policy＂ to first be implemented in disability institutions. Faced with the shortage of care workers in disability institutions, we argue that ＂building a safe and healthy working environment＂ should be listed as an important item for manpower maintenance. This suggestion is also a response to the international trend of ＂workplace health promotion＂ as its core strategy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202106-202107130008-202107130008-55-106,43,2021,NTU Social Work Review

In so doing, this article refers to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the inspection framework adopted by England, in order to demonstrate that the purpose of inspections is not merely for the government to check that institutions are meeting their legal compliance requirements, but also to drive improvements and enhance outcomes for children and young people. In addition, the article draws on observations gathered during in-depth interviews with workers in children's welfare institutions throughout Taiwan, and with academics working in this field. The aim is to raise the following considerations for future policy or law reforms: (1) in the short-term, introducing a mandatory requirement for inspectors to receive training before they conduct inspections, in order to enhance their understanding of child welfare practices. There is also a need re-think and design a more articulated way for children to participate in these inspections; (2) in the medium term, further government guidance is required, in the form of regulations and directives, concerning the core principles that should inform inspections of children's welfare institutions. There is also a need to enhance the dialogue between inspectors and children's institutions, as well as platforms to enable experiences and good practices to be shared among institutions; and (3) in the longer-term, the government should consider establishing an independent institution to be responsible for inspections of children's welfare institutions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202106-202107130008-202107130008-107-148,43,2021,NTU Social Work Review

Seldom can they become part of the professional middle class in which residential care plays a crucial role. Nevertheless, the interplay between residential care and class inequality is underexplored. Employing a Bourdieusian analysis, this paper explores, both socially and psychologically, how the field of residential care shapes the classed habitus and the emotional landscape of its service users. Data from interviews with 15 ex-service users, alongside participant observations, are used to sketch how the social field of the residential child and youth care service is operationalized, shaping the unequal psychic landscape of class for its residents. This paper concludes that future research on the implementation and improvement of residential child and youth care services can benefit from the voices and experiences of the service user, who should be valued and centered in the service.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202012-202103020006-202103020006-1-55,42,2020,NTU Social Work Review

Situated learning refers to the design of a series of learning situations in the curriculum, so that learners can connect knowledge, actions, and experience, and then learn how to employ ＂situational knowledge and ability＂. In this study, I will use the BASW ＂Methodology of Social Work＂ as the target to investigate how attendees to this course acquired embodied knowledge of social work research methods. The study finds several elements in the curriculum design of situated learning: First, teachers should be able to translate the core knowledge and competence of the course into lectures as well as specific practical actions. Second, these practical actions should interest the learners and make them willing to cooperate. Third, the learners should generate specific experience through the operation of practical actions. Fourth, the teacher should be able to guide and discuss the experiences generated from the practical action, and link the relationships among action, experiences, and core knowledge. In addition, through this teaching model, students should become more interested in the curriculum, better understand the steps and knowledge of social work research methods through actual operation, and the purpose of social work research method.

The aim is to improve their quality of life. Due to its multi-professional work context, and the development of its ladder career system, medical social work highlights the need to define the connotation of professional competence and level among medical social workers. The purpose of this study is to establish a consensual structure for grouping the medical social workers' ability. Hence, this structure would be used for clarification and establishing an index and context for medical social workers' professional ability and capability. Utilizing qualitative research in this study, the gathering and analysis of information includes document investigation, focus groups, and modified Delphi method.

However, East Asian welfare states are transforming. On the one hand, family policies are expanding to help people reach a work-life balance due to socio-demographic transformations. On the other hand, the responsibility of welfare provision has been gradually shifted to non-state sectors; therefore, the idea of welfare pluralism is emerging. However, the transformation of the welfare state needs to be underpinned on the micro-foundation of the demand side, which is public opinion. Thus, this study will examine public attitudes towards childcare and eldercare services in Taiwan by analyzing the 2012 Taiwanese Social Change Survey. While our multi-nominal logistic regression models show that childcare is based on intergenerational solidarity, self-interest is more important in explaining attitudes towards eldercare policy. We conclude that despite familialism remaining significant in explaining public attitudes towards childcare and eldercare in Taiwan, divergent familialism can be found in different social policy areas in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-202006-202007140003-202007140003-1-56,41,2020,NTU Social Work Review
Positive Youth Development Model: Promoting mutual relationship between youth and community in social work practice,"Meng-Jung Lee, Yen-Ping Liu","youth developmental needs, positive youth development (PYD), youth social services, strength-based perspective, ecological assets","Taiwan government renewed the Protection of Children and Youths Welfare and Rights Act in 2011 to ensure youth development rather than problem solving; however, gaps between the law and direct practice on youth social services remain. This study aims to introduce a positive youth development (PYD) model and provide a theoretical framework for a paradigm shift in youth social services. First, the PYD model is based on developmental system theory (DST), arguing that human development involves continuous interactions between individuals and contexts; thus, the intrapersonal and interpersonal changes during adolescence should be considered as a fundamental strength rather than risk. PYD model hypothesizes that mutually beneficial interactions between youth and contexts will not only result in fewer risk behaviors but more youth contribution to the society. Second, empirical studies were reviewed to examine the above hypothetical relationship and to provide evidence for professionals working with youth to apply the PYD model to their practice. Then, youth social services in Taiwan were reviewed under a PYD lens; four obstacles in implementing development-based services were identified: 1. Values: the current services and programs over-emphasize problem solving rather than capability building; 2. Services: the majority of the existing community programs fail to address youth developmental needs; 3. Research: limited empirical research examining and comparing the process and outcomes across various youth programs. 4. Issues of youth disempowerment in Chinese culture.

"Factors associated with social work students' attitude toward poverty: social work education, ideology, and poverty attribution","Wei-Cheng Liu, Li-Chen Cheng","path analysis, poverty attribution, social work education, ideology, poverty attitude","A core tenet of social work education is to cultivate students' professional identity and ability to show concern for disadvantaged people. However, in the past, little research has focused on exploring the relationships between social work education and student attitudes toward the disadvantaged people in Taiwan. To be exact, based on the attribution theory model proposed by Zucker & Weiner (1993), this study tested path relationships among social work education, welfare ideology, poverty attribution, and attitudes toward poverty. Four hundred and twenty-four social work students from 16 different universities across Taiwan were recruited through a stratified random cluster sampling design. They were invited to give responses to a structured questionnaire. As expected, social work students who had higher learning competency on poverty issues, leaned toward left-wing ideology, had higher approval of structural poverty attribution, and had higher opposition to personal and cultural attributions were positively related to attitudes toward poverty. In path analysis, the attribution model which posits that students' poverty attribution has a mediating effect on the relationship between students' welfare ideology and their attitudes toward poverty was also confirmed. The results in this study indicate that students' learning competency on poverty issues plays an important role in cultivating students to be reflective and thoughtful in their poverty attribution and welfare ideology toward poor people. The competency was then indirectly was transformed to enhance their poverty attribution toward more structural explanations, eventually favorably changing their attitudes toward poverty.

Child Injury and Parental Pain: The Grief Experience and Rescue Actions of Parents of People with Ketamine Abuse Disorders,Pei-Jen Tsai,"parents, Ketamine, rescue, substance abuse, family with drug addicts","Ketamine poses unique risks, and the parents of individuals with drug abuse disorders are unrecognized victims of drug abuse. This study used qualitative research methods. Ten parents of individuals with ketamine addiction participated in family visits, in-depth interviews, and family group meetings to reveal the effects of drug addiction on families and the rescue actions of the parents of people with drug abuse disorders. The study revealed that the average duration at which addiction sustained was 7.3 years and that parental rescue actions spanned from childhood to adulthood. Ketamine addiction, abuse, and related social harm are serious problems that alter the life path of those who become addicted. Parents included in this study implemented many rescue actions, including source breakout, assisting their children in conquering their addiction, and risk management. These actions spanned from early active rescue until family exhaustion. The rescue actions of the parents also varied according to the age of their children. Individuals addicted to ketamine lack detoxification resources, and school routine assistance has been disrupted. Therefore, parents rely on their own strength to rescue their children from addiction.

Making the Production of a Text Visible: Analyzing the Investigatory Report on ＂The Tragic Death of Girl Tsao＂ to Explore the Methodology of Critical Discourse Analysis,Yi-Shih Cheng,"social work research, methodology, critical discourse analysis, child protection","This p aper aims to examine the rationality and methodology of critical discourse analysis (CDA), in seeking to extend its theory and applications for social work research and practice. It is divided into three parts. The first part discusses CDA as an analytical concept founded on phenomenological linguistics claiming the sociality of language; post-structuralism declared speech as a power process, and critical theory asserted the ideology in language, pursuing to understand the relationship between language and social process. The second part examines CDA as a research orientation: how to use phenomenology, hermeneutics and post-structuralism to disclose the meaning-making network and the role of power in texts; how to choose text; and how to analyze the text. In the third part, the investigatory report on the ＂The Tragic Death of Young Girl Tsao＂ from the Control Yuan is text used to carry out the steps of CDA analysis obtained above. It also demonstrates how the core-concern of CDA: ＂how does language figure (this article is a child protection discourse) as an element in the social process (this article consolidates the child protection system in Taiwan)＂.

The Taiwanese government therefore opened up the foreign care workers (FCWs) association to enter the formal elderly care systems. The aim of this research was to analyze the current situation of FCWs participating in training, focusing on labor situations, and analyzing the factors affecting the implementation of education and training. This research applied qualitative methods, using field observations and in-depth interviews to collect data. Four long-term care facilities participated in this study. The subjects are foreign care workers and administrators, social workers and nursing staff. The study results revealed that the care work of long-term care facilities depends entirely on FCWs in Taiwan. Although the FCWs were trained before they came to Taiwan, their effectiveness was not as expected. Facilities need to pay attention to FCWs' recruitment training management and provide a comprehensive training program for them. Organizational differences affect the effectiveness of the implementation of on-the-job training. Finally, this research suggests that the design and evaluation of training materials need to consider the cultural and semantic differences of FCWs, as well as to evaluate the requirements of FCWs and the efficiency of training course. The standard operating procedures given to the FCWs need to be developed, along with government and private sectors cooperation.

This paper aims to reconstruct the medical social workers' subjective experiences in seeking organ donations and to analyze the struggles faced by the medical social workers in the process of guiding families to acquiesce in organ donation as well as the solutions derived thereby in order to accumulate practical work methods. In addition, through the integration and analysis of practical work methods related to organ donation, this study provides reference for future organ donation work, aiming to enhance care and service quality. This study, adopting a qualitative method, invited 12 medical social workers who had been engaged in, or were currently engaged in organ donation to discuss their working experience with family members during the process of organ donation. Thematic analysis was used to analyze 12 texts. The results showed that medical social workers tend to carry out organ donation with family members by willingness consultation instead of purely focusing on organ procurement. The main work target is grief counseling supplemented by organ procurement.

It covered 11 professionals working in various periods including team preparation, service planning, service provision and revision, and a conclusive period, for a total of 1 year and 11 months. Eleven male oral cancer survivors received this service, and eight of them returned to work. There were three major findings. Firstly, there was a gap between service provision and use due to the fact that the patient was still unaware of the importance of returning to work at the initial stage of diagnosis, was unable to cooperate with service time, displayed lack of trust, lack of a friendly working environment; secondly, this multiple disciplinary team met the ＂interdisciplinary team＂ model but had not yet reached the ＂transdisciplinary team＂ model; the main reason being that the branching out of professional roles into other fields was limited; and thirdly, the interpersonal network, unit supervisors support, clear common goals and members commitment, open communication atmosphere, and communication technology were determined to be important factors for the stable operation of this multiple disciplinary team.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201812-201902130007-201902130007-51-98,38,2018,NTU Social Work Review

People with disabilities are regular users of medical services. In the standardized professional medical system, they are often regarded as ＂non-standard patients＂ and face many medical barriers. The purpose of this study was to present the problems faced by disabled people in medical environments, and to explore their opinions and actions under the medical system from the perspective of ＂medical service users＂. This study employed qualitative research methods to explore the subjective medical experiences of 12 physically disabled persons and 14 intellectually disabled persons and their caregivers, supplemented with interview data on three medical professionals to analyze the situation of people with disabilities in the medical system. This study found that people with disabilities appeared to be out of place in the standardization of the medical system, such as non-applicability to certain testing or inspection equipment, the occurrence of secondary or comorbid conditions, and difficulty to communicate with medical personnel. In the face of medical difficulties, some people with disabilities could guide the medical staff to develop a cooperative mode; some of these patients had secondary injuries due to improper treatments, while others chose to give up medical treatment or examinations due to excessive failure experiences.

There hasn't yet been a thorough investigation on the cost-effectiveness of this scheme. This study explored care visitors' experiences in Eastern Taiwan in seeking to find the scheme in actual practice, as well as its cost-effectiveness. The research results are summarized into four points. First, regarding care visitors' roles, services and target population, the interviewed care visitors share similar perceptions concerning their roles, with illness-related medical problems as their service priority. The target population and service period in these three counties differ. Second, in terms of value and cost-effectiveness of the visiting service, care visitors make up for the shortage of service staff for community mentally ill patients and offer their family members a lot of help. Third, there are gaps between service planning and service implementation. Also, some problems were found in the process of service delivery. Fourth, care visitors face the dilemma of balancing service quantities and quality, and the potential threat to their personal safety also causes care visitors' concern.

The community building involves 6 aspects: humanities and education, industrial development, welfare and health care, tribal security, environment and landscape, and environmental protection and ecology. The population is indigenous people aged over 20; 679 successful samples, referred by 48 indigenous family service centers located across the whole island and offshore, were collected and analyzed. The results show that the stock of indigenous social capital is rather high, and the degree of satisfaction with the 6 aspects of community building is diverse. The correlation between social capital and community building is also various. In general, the linking social capital contributes the most to community building, followed by bridging social capital.

Also, ＂housing pathways＂ (Clapham, 2005, 2010) is employed to study the patterns and factors in relation to these families' housing and care transition. Thirty families, including older parents (≥60 year-old) and their ageing sons/daughters (≥40 year-old) with ID were invited and completed the in-depth interview which was conducted at their homes in Hsinchu City. A thematic approach was used in the analysis of the qualitative interviews. The findings showed that an older two-generation family might include not only older parents and ageing offspring with ID, but also the ageing siblings of the ageing adults with ID. These ageing siblings were likely to be the carers of older and frail parents and ageing adults with ID. Families including older parents and ageing adults with ID rarely used services which are provided for people with disability and older people from formal systems. The parents' care transition plan for ageing adults with ID and their own moving plan in old age were intersected, connecting parents' and siblings' individual, family and social contexts. Two types of pathways to both areas, namely care transition of ageing offspring with ID and older parents' moving, were identified: ＂planned＂ vs. ＂not planned＂ and ＂not considering moving＂ vs. ＂considering moving＂. The types of pathways of moving in old age and care transition among these families are related to individual parents' autonomy and parents home identity and both parents' and siblings' cultural identity as well as with the relationship and financial conditions of both the original and siblings' families. This study suggests that both the health and social care needs of these older two-generation families including older parents, ageing adults with ID and their ageing siblings should be considered a high priority by the long-term care scheme which is currently one of the main social policies in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201806-201807130010-201807130010-99-149,37,2018,NTU Social Work Review

The process of Hong Kong's social welfare subvention policy was debated from 1995 to 2000 in Hong Kong's legislative council. The implementation of lump sum grants in the social welfare system was most remarkable development in 2001; this practical model or social welfare reform was part the reform of new public management. Currently its subsequent effects are still influencing relevant stakeholders in the entire field of social welfare. After an analysis of the relevant documents of Hong Kong's legislative council from 1995 to 2000, this paper finds that in the process of policy making the Hong Kong government played the administrative and dominant roles. Interest groups and members of the legislative council amended the policy of the stakeholders. Both sides discussed and negotiated in the legislative council as a communication platform. The Hong Kong Government manipulated its financial resources by ＂giving bonuses,＂ thereby gradually inducing non-governmental organizations to support their policy making. Finally it legalized and implemented the lump sum grant system. This paper reviews the logic of Hong Kong's policy making process of lump sum grants in social welfare, the new public management implications and its effects on Hong Kong's Government and social welfare institutions. The results should serve as reference. The use of lump sum grants in the social welfare system was enacted in 2001, and the debate between managerialism and professionalism among relevant stakeholders in the entire field of social welfare also started at the same time.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201712-201801080007-201801080007-1-45,36,2017,NTU Social Work Review

In particular, child protection and family support regimes embraced by Anglo-Saxon countries and continental European ones, respectively, have been the focus of heated debate. Amidst the process, the two camps started to undertake policy exchange, which triggered their subsequent policy reforms. These international experiences have important implications for Taiwan's own policy development. Having acknowledged this, an institutional approach is adopted in this comparative- historical paper to address two related research questions. The first concerns investigating the politics of child protection reforms in the case countries of the two aforementioned regimes following policy exchange. The other pertains to inquiring how international lessons have shaped Taiwan’s policy reforms as well as its related challenges in respect of policy implementation. With regards to the two major research findings, first, it is elicited that the convergence thesis of international child protection regimes put forward by some child welfare scholars is not sustainable. To the contrary, the analysis based on an institutional approach discovers a continuing diversity of policy regimes. As to the second finding, it is demonstrated that with heavily reliance on the importation of American reform experiences, Taiwan's child protection regime has been transformed into a managerialist one. Regardless whether this arrangement is appropriate or not, it cannot be ignored that the inadequacy of system inputs could have serious repercussions regarding the capacity and efficacy of the post-reform child protection system on the island.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201712-201801080007-201801080007-97-136,36,2017,NTU Social Work Review

The reason for not seeking help from the formal medical system is generally either personal preference or the stigmatization associated with social exclusion resulting from the identity of drug users being revealed as a result of their seeking help from the formal medical system. This study intends to explore the subjective experiences of drug users when seeking help from the formal medical system, as well as determining what kind of alternative medical systems they sought help from. Using a qualitative approach tocollect data, this study employed in-depth interviews with seven drug users regarding their help-seeking experiences in the formal medical system. This study also conducted participatory observation when five interviewees sought help at different kinds of medical systems. The results indicated that the interviewees experienced recurrent stigmatization due to the judgmental identification of these addicts not only as patients, also as criminals. The unfriendly social treatment they experienced precluded them from subsequently accessing formal medical systems. Subsequently, the drug users sought help from other alternative self-help sources, such as drugs provided by their peers, drug stores or clinics in the community, mixing drugs and medicine, folk therapy, etc., which sometime resulting in lethal harm from drug misuse and overdosing.

Using institutional ethnography as my research approach, I observed the daily care schedule of care workers (both Taiwanese and foreign) and interviewed institutional managers and their care workers, as well as family members serving as caregivers with and without hired in-home foreign care workers. The texts for Taiwan's nursing home system were also collected to discover how they make for the imbalance between space and care needs, and also why nursing homes, even those very near hospitals, require family caregivers to take clients to rehabilitation and other medical appointments. The truth is that from the hospital to the nursing home, the family has to assume all care responsibility, and when the family can't handle said responsibility, hiring a foreign care worker is the only alternative. This study's analysis shows multiple silhouettes of the ruling relations in a nursing home as well as their influences on the disjuncture experiences and institutional actions. One major finding of this study is how institutional managers distribute their care workers according to the number and placement of family-hired foreign care workers stationed in nursing homes, in effect balancing care needs and staff ratio. In addition, although it seems that a seamless care system is in place, the real issues behind the system have yet been illuminated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201706-201708180003-201708180003-137-182,35,2017,NTU Social Work Review
Comparison of Disability Policy Models and Long-Term Care Policies in Germany and Taiwan: A Rehabilitation-Oriented Perspective,Yi-Chun Chou,"Germany, long-term care policies, disability policy model, rehabilitation-oriented policy","Since 2007, the Taiwanese government has promoted associated long-term care (LTC) policies in response to demographic changes in Taiwan's aging society. According to the most recent draft of the LTC insurance law, the government Taiwan intends to provide LTC services that are almost identical to disability services. By contrast, under the rehabilitation-oriented disability policy model, LTC for elderly people is separate from the disability services in the LTC insurance program pioneered in Germany. Through a content analysis of the relevant disability laws and comparative historical analysis, the framework of Michael Maschke's disability policy model is used in this paper to explore the effect of the German disability policy model on the benefit plan for persons with disabilities, and the differences in cases of LTC insurance between Germany and Taiwan are compared. The results indicate that under Germany's rehabilitation-oriented disability policy, disability services are defined as lifelong support measures for assisting people with disabilities in resuming their work and social life. However, LTC for elderly adults depends entirely on other LTC insurance recipients and is distinct from disability support services. The disability policy in Germany prioritizes rehabilitation over LTC services, and this is because LTC imposes a financial burden on social expenditures. By contrast, the orientation and core values of the disability policy model in Taiwan are unclear, thus affecting the benefits planning of LTC insurance and leading to the absence of differences between LTC services and disability services under two distinct evaluation criteria.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201612-201701040030-201701040030-1-39,34,2016,NTU Social Work Review

In addition, this study tested the moderating effect of gender by using data from an ongoing nationally representative Taiwanese youth sample. Methods: The data for this study were drawn from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey. The present research used the data when students were in the 7th and 9th grades. Stata 13.0 was used for data analyses. Results: The findings support a linear model indicating that those students who experience more family risks are more likely to develop negative outcomes. Moreover, girls have higher levels of depressive symptoms than boys do, while boys have higher levels of delinquency than girls do. The effect of cumulative risk on academic performance is lower among girls, in comparison to boys. Conclusion: The findings confirm the accuracy of the linear cumulative risk model, highlight the influence of cumulative risk on youths’ de- pression, academic and behavior outcomes, and suggest potential gender-based differences, particularly in regard to academic performance. The findings suggest the need for comprehensive family prevention programs as well as stress-coping training for youths in order to reduce the influence of family risks.

The results, based on 206 respondents, have shown that the one-year prevalence for LGB's intimate partner violence is 7.8%, while lifetime prevalence for LGB's intimate partner violence increases up to 17.0%. Among these respondents faced with intimate partner violence, few have ever asked for help either from informal or formal resources.

In-depth interviews were done with five subjects who constantly suffered abuse from childhood till adolescent. Findings of this study show that factors preventing interviewees from disclosing the abuse include previous negative experience of contacting the service system, worry about consequences after disclosure, belief in “solving problem through endurance”, lack of obvious evidence of scar, and surrounding adults’ advice of fatalism. However, they are willing to re-disclose their actual experience of being battered once they have enhanced ability of evaluating risk, strengthened consciousness of self-protection, better knowledge of and belief in child and juvenile protective service system, as well as social support. Therefore, as suggested by this study, with respect to child and juvenile protective service system, it’s necessary to reinforce staffs’ understanding of and sensitivity to abused children and adolescents’ help-seeking behaviors, prudently investigate truth of the abuse, focus on safety guarantee services for children and adolescents, and continuously enhance the school system’s awareness of child and juvenile protective service system.

The Nomad Phenomenon in Social Welfare? Research on the Strategies of Non-profit Organizations in the Contracting of Community Care Stations in Taipei City,"Yu-Ching Liu, Cheng-Fen Chen","community care station, non-profit organizations, social service contracting","In 2005, the Executive Yuan promoted the “Taiwan Health Community Six-Star Program” encouraging communities and non-profit organizations to establish community care stations. Compared with previous contract programs’ emphasizing price, this program encourages organizations from different sectors to join, and allows each other-sector organization to depend on its own ability and sector-related practices. This research is based on the theory of resource dependence, using case studies to analyze the strategies of non-profit organizations, and focuses on explaining how and why providers choose to become functional or budgetary community care stations. This paper includes four cases: two functional and two budgetary. We found that a nomadic social welfare phenomenon exists among non-profit organizations. The major motivation behind this nomad phenomenon is that budgetary non-profit organizations apply for the community care station program in order to acquire government resources. In addition to chasing the additional resources afforded to program participants, they also benefit in that being a community care station improves their reputations from both the government’s and service user’s perspectives. The second finding is a franchise-like relationship between functional and budgetary organizations. While the expectation behind the central government’s policy was that functional and budgetary organizations would be independent of one another, Taipei City government’s contract with elderly welfare centers required they take on the additional role of functional community care centers, forcing them to assist new budgetary community care stations in their districts to apply for the project and implement community care work. This relationship resembles a franchise in that both types of organization benefit: functional organizations get the opportunity of building a community service network, while budgetary organizations receive free knowledge and instruction as well as assistance with implementation. In conclusion, because the central government’s contract programs are rarely modified, non-profit organizations need to constantly look for more resources and supplementary programs to survive. Finding a way to integrate these different programs is an important issue for Taiwan’s community care system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201606-201606280011-201606280011-43-87,33,2016,NTU Social Work Review
The Development and Reform of Pension Automatic Adjustment Mechanisms in Developed Countries,"Tsung-Hsi Fu, Shih-Jiun Shi, Hung-Yang Lin, Chiu-Lan Chang","pension, pension automatic balance mechanism, automatic adjustment mechanism, pension reform","Due to population aging, maturation of pension schemes and unfavorable labor market conditions, Western high-income countries have all conducted pension reforms during the past 30 years. One of the main challenges to pension reform is the need to balance two major goals of pension schemes: the protection of older people’s income and the maintenance of financial sustainability. Both of these dimensions are directly linked to benefit levels. Since the 1990s, many Western countries have developed a pension automatic balance mechanism (ABM) to improve financial soundness. Its main concept involves linking pension benefits to pension solvency and sustainability. This newly developed mechanism exerts significant impacts on traditional public pension schemes. To some extent, it signals a change in the development logic of public pensions. In addition, it alters fundamental principles for determining pension benefit levels. This paper contains three major parts. The first part reviews the development of the pension automatic adjustment mechanism and pension automatic balance mechanism. The second part compares pension automatic balance mechanisms among major countries. The final part analyzes the impacts and implications of pension automatic balance for public pension systems.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201606-201606280011-201606280011-89-128,33,2016,NTU Social Work Review
From Patienthood to Personhood: Clubhouse Workers’ Journey of Professional Formation,"Yu-Hui Lu, Chiung-I Liang","medicalization, subjectivity, clubhouse, mental illness, professional relationship","The clubhouse philosophy for people with mental illness is summed up as “from patienthood to personhood.” It expects workers to treat each people with mental illness as “a person” instead of “a patient”, so that they can become partners working together “side by side”; the voluntariness of members is then respected. Besides, the organization in pursuit of efficiency and performance is influenced by the policy of “New Managerialism”, while the workers have to deal with la significant amount of office administration. The findings of this research show that clubhouse workers are confronted with the social expectation that they will play the role of “almighty agent for the mentally ill.” In the meantime, the tension between clubhouse development and policy requirements puts them under great pressure. All of the above considerations raise the issue of reconstructing the professional relationship between workers and members. Clubhouse workers reflect that: Before reconstructing the professional relationship, they have to go through the process of transforming their professional subjectivity reflectively via knowledge regarding “from patienthood to personhood” in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201606-201606280011-201606280011-129-170,33,2016,NTU Social Work Review
"Biology, Genes and Social Work: Research Methods, Practice Implications and Future Directions",Hsing-Jung Chen,"biopsychosocial, intervention, brain and neuroscience, nature and nurture, transdisciplinary research","Despite the long support for the biopsychosocial perspective in social work, knowledge of biology is still not well integrated into the building process and daily practice of social work, or in social work education. Moreover, transdisciplinary research is a developing trend among biology, genetics and social science internationally; practical implementation has begun to incorporate biology, genetics and psychosocial research findings. However, this kind of transdisciplinary research and practice is limited in the social work literature in Taiwan. This knowledge gap impedes social workers from fulfilling their professional roles. The development of biology/gene-social knowledge not only improves social workers’ understanding that bio-psycho-social factors are inextricably interlinked, but also promotes social work practice and policy to improve people’s well-being. This paper aims to fill this gap. This paper starts with a summary of the development of new biology/ gene-social knowledge, how social work in America responds to this ongoing trend, the challenges social workers face and the progress so far. The paper then introduces genetic research methods, epigenetics and neuroplasticity. Ways to apply this knowledge to inform social work practice and research are also discussed, with examples provided. Lastly, suggestions for the development of social work in Taiwan are also offered. The main emphases are to cultivate social workers’ curiosity about biology, to equip social workers with biology-related knowledge through tertiary level and continuous education, to prepare social workers with the ability and skills to engage in interdisciplinary research, and to increase social workers’ awareness of ethical and social justice issues related to this area.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201606-201606280011-201606280011-171-201,33,2016,NTU Social Work Review

Taipei City's Subsidized Institutional Care for Low-Income Elderly: Within Sight but Beyond Reach,"Chen-Fen Chen, Yu-Yuan Kuan","nonprofit, Taipei City Government, care institution, for-profit, elderly","After passing the first amendment of Taiwan's Senior Citizen Welfare Act in 1997, the government has allowed long-term care institutions to operate as for-profit entities. One of the government's strategies has been to encourage both non-profit and for-profit institutions to become service providers. Whether such changes have benefitted the industry is questionable. It is important to understand the causal relationships between institutional attributions and the social role in serving the low-income elderly. This paper focused on explaining how and why providers of long-term institutional care for Taipei's low-income elderly are mainly for-profit institutions, particularly small institutions. Secondary data analysis, documentary analysis and in-depth interviews were used to examine the quantity and proportion of the purchase of low-income elderly services from non-profit and for-profit institutions by the Taipei City Government from 2006 to 2010. In addition, institutions' positions and strategies, as well as Taipei's related long-term care policies and programs were carefully examined. This research found that government subsidies for Taipei's low-income elderly are nearly enough to cover for-profit C class fees; A and B class institutions thus limit low-income admissions. The reason for the for-profit A and B class institutions admitting low-income elderly is to make up for unoccupied bed costs. However, non-profit institutions get additional subsidization for staff and facilities, so providing service to the low-income elderly results in less pressure, causing a right-and-responsibility imbalance and unfair competition between non-profit and for-profit institutions. Modifying Taipei's subsidy policies for low-income elderly care institutions is necessary, and will set an example for other city governments.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201512-201512210030-201512210030-33-78,32,2015,NTU Social Work Review

The legal employment quota for disabled persons can be offset by the aforementioned measurement. How will the employment quota policy impact massagers with visual impairment? This study aimed to explore the reasons for persons with visual impairment choosing massager as their career, and interviewed 15 participants. Furthermore, adoption to social inclusion will be discussed with four dimensions: rights of employment, work environment, social relationships and sense of belonging. The results show that, compared with regular employees, massagers with visual impairment face unstable employment opportunities and unequal welfare, even if they can obtain a stable salary and avoid risks. Additionally, even private industries which improve the environment for massagers with visual impairment, still regard them as informal employees. For the most part, massagers with visual impairment can merely acquire the opportunity to be employed by industries, but without being included in the general labor market. Consequently, the government will need to support more measures for the massagers with visual impairment to aid them in entering into the general labor market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201512-201512210030-201512210030-79-132,32,2015,NTU Social Work Review

This systematic literature review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate to what extent ＂active aging＂ has been explored in journal articles in gerontology and how we researchers could further push the envelope going forward on this concept. We scanned all journal articles from Web of Science (WOS) in SSCI in the 21st century (a 15 year-span from 2000 to 2014) on active aging (N=205) by using WOS statistics and CLAN, a transcript analysis tool, to conduct meta- analysis. Results show: 1. Current research assets are not evenly distributed and are mostly concentrated in Europe. 2. The subject areas under gerontology that have been probed the most are social, environmental and educational. 3. The most recurring research themes are lifelong learning, employment and gender. 4. The most researched determinants on AA are gender and physical activities. 5. The most used outcome measurement of AA is Quality of Life (QOL). Our suggestions for future research directions: 1. AA research in developing countries should become top priority for international governments, especially longitudinal cohort studies, due to the population aging acceleration in those regions. 2. Global urbanization reinforces the need for further exploration of the scientifically proven correlates between physical environments and AA. 3. Inter-disciplinary researches on AA have become mandatory due to the complex nature of global aging challenges, such as how to apply rapid technological advancement to help AA.

However, few studies explore a group of invisible group playing an important role in taking on the care giving responsibility, namely the siblings. Because the literature investigating siblings' care giving experience is limited, the sibling caretakers cannot present the unique contribution to, and level of caring involvement with, their ill siblings, or how they differ from parent caregivers. This study employed a qualitative method, purposive sampling to investigate twelve participants. Three participants were found to have consistent care giving experience with their parents, due to the natural desire to provide care to any family members. Nine participants could differentiate their own care giving experiences from their parents', based on the subjective perception of the role, relationship status and natural boundaries in the family system. Then we concluded by examining the self-perception of the interviewees, and interpreted their care giving experiences. Based on the collected data analysis and anecdotal experience, the definition of the caretaker and the caregiver differs: the former involves the care giving experience of siblings, and the latter deals with care provided by the parent. This study's findings suggest that practitioners should have a variety of care giving expectations regarding the caregivers or caretakers, such as providing essential psychoeducation materials and building a work alliance. Moreover, the policymakers should focus on both caregivers and caretakers in seeking to provide the necessary social services, as well as to monitor the implementation.

Cross-Over and Empathy: A Phenomenological Research on Peer Service Experience of the Wraparound Program in Taiwan,"Yi-Shih Cheng, Tsrong-Chi Shiao, Min-Liu Chang, Chien-Yu Chou","hermeneutic-phenomenology methodology, empathy, ethical act, Wraparound services","Current studies or training programs of empathy regularly concentrate on raise up professionals' knowledge and skill; they do not focus on cultivating their empathetic crossing-over. From the perspective of interpersonal interaction and ordering, the empathy involves a conscious action of crossing-over, which occurs between two actors, thereby enabling these two actors of different living backgrounds and perceptions to mutually connect with, understand, and relate to each others' feelings and perceptions. However, how the phenomenon of crossing-over often takes place in the helping relationship, i.e. how it is actually formed, develops, and progresses has not yet been investigated. Therefore, this study aims to offer some answers by adopting the hermeneutic- phenomenology methodology to study peer service experience within 'Wraparound' programs operated in Taiwan. The study finds that the essence of this empathetic crossing-over between two actors (a helping professional and a client) could be characterized as an ethical act. On the part of a helping professional, the act may be understood as a calling stemming from the presence of their clients who are seeking their help. In response to this calling, helping professionals would go through a series of dynamic processes consisting of observing and shifting their focus onto their clients, placing themselves at the edge of their self-consciousness, going beyond their self-consciousness, and then carrying out the action of empathetic crossing-over. Based on the findings, the study puts forth some suggestions regarding the education and training for social work practitioners. We anticipate that the study might extends and deepens the theories related to empathy, and could help social work practitioners to close the gap between their knowledge and actions in practice during the process of creating and maintaining a helping relationship.

Nine in-depth interviews with male oral cancer survivors were conducted and the data analysis adopted a thematic approach. This study argues that male oral cancer survivors had faced unemployment as well as problematic human relationships after they got cancer, and that these events influenced their masculinity. The types of masculinity changed from 'hegemony' and 'marginalization' to 'new good man', 'good father' or 'big brother', and these changes of masculinity could improve their ability to face the challenges in their daily life. In contrast, two male oral cancer survivors turned into 'men out of luck' because of unemployment, impaired human relationship, and lack of family support. Furthermore, the acceptance of family members can help the transformation of masculinity in a positive way. This study suggests that the helping professionals could assist the family in becoming a vehicle for the transformation of masculinity and development of resilience of male oral cancer survivors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201412-201501080003-201501080003-139-185,30,2014,NTU Social Work Review
"I Think, Therefore I am: Developing the Competence for Epistemological Thinking for Psychiatric Social Workers",Yu-Te Huang,"post-positivism, critical theory, constructivism, holistic approach, psychiatric social work","Following the movement toward professional institutionalization, social work in the contemporary era tends to uncritically endorse post-positivism in research and practice with the attempt to gain societal recognition as real professionals. However, in the context of a rapidly and enormously changing society, along with an increasingly diversified practical knowledge, the author of this article argues for the building of the competence of social workers for epistemological thinking-an ability to analyze, critique, and synthesize knowledge-as essential to fully serve the mission of the profession, and, more importantly, to establish a professional distinctive space. An epistemological paradigm contains a set of statements with respect to the nature, assumptions, applications, and limitations of knowledge. Four epistemological paradigms have been delineated in the existing literature including positivism, post-positivism, constructivism, and critical theory. In addition, the holistic approach, which is rooted in Chinese philosophy, has been a widely practiced paradigm in the Chinese context. To demonstrate the competence for epistemological thinking, this article used these four paradigms to synthesize and structure the literature in relation to depression, a significant issue that has been extensively addressed by psychiatric social workers. As a summary table is made to situate knowledge within the four paradigms, it becomes evident that knowledge developed in accordance with the four epistemological paradigms is relevant for, and should be integrated into, social work practice. As such, this article suggests that rather than being sorely attached to a particular epistemological paradigm, social workers need to develop a comprehensive familiarity with the various epistemological approaches in order to be responsive to the clients' wide range of needs. By utilizing the epistemological analysis model expounded in this article, it is hoped that epistemological thinking will be incorporated into social work education and training.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201412-201501080003-201501080003-187-226,30,2014,NTU Social Work Review
Exploring Empowerment Experiences of Social Workers for Marital Violence,Ching-Hung Shen,"disempowered, empowerment, marital violence, social worker","Due to the lack of ideal labor conditions for those dealing with marital violence, the researcher aimed to explore the empowerment of social workers, conducting an ""empowerment scale"" on 101 social workers who came from 21 marital violence intervention organizations. Twenty-four participants who received more than 100 grades in the scaling (including ""mild to high level"" and ""highly empowered"") were individually interviewed six months after completing the scale. The results show the empowerment of social workers comes from clients, significant others, peers, supervisors, administrators, and networks. In the four categories, 11 elements enhancing the empowerment of social workers were found by researchers, including recognizing service efficacy from clients, constructing beliefs of work from significant others, initiating reconstruction, recognizing feedback, acquiring guidance, being publicly encouraging, receiving empathic care, having autonomy, improving connections, matching word to deeds from organizations (including peers, supervisors and administrators), and possessing resources and recognizing feedback from networks. Moreover, social workers have mild to high levels of empowerment for three dimensions, which include the individual, organization and network, revealing self-efficacy, autonomy, meaning, competence, teamwork, impact and action, as well as commitment to marital violence interventions. The organization (including peers, supervisors and administrators) is critical for empowering social workers; the researcher suggests the administrators focus more on the empowered atmosphere of the organization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201406-201407160004-201407160004-1-51,29,2014,NTU Social Work Review
Elucidating Service Program Responses to Domestic Violence in Taiwan,Mei-Kuei Yu,"service program, collaboration, domestic violence prevention","This study examines the effectiveness of domestic violence prevention-related service programs in 22 local governments. Based on those results, the growth and decline of domestic violence prevention-related service programs in 22 local governments are categorized. Recommendations are also made on how to enhance the quality of domestic violence prevention-related service programs in Taiwan. While lasting for ten months (i.e. March to December 2011), this study consists of three stages. In stage 1, domestic violence prevention-related service programs from 2007-2011 in 22 local governments are reviewed. In stage 2, small group forums are held in 22 local governments to exchange opinions with NGOs and governmental agencies on how to more effectively implement the service programs in each local government, determine the availability of resources to these local governments, and examine the difficulties of local governments in implementing such programs. In stage 3, a focus group is conducted in which local government representatives discuss the primary evaluation results of stages 1 and 2. Analysis results indicate that domestic violence prevention-related service programs have evolved from victim assistance to a correction service of perpetrators. The programs have also evolved from social case work to group work and community work. Additionally, for instance, the muti-agency service programs have been extended from social service organizations to prisons. Moreover, the services offered previously only to individual victims have been extended to others, including children and other important family members. Results of this study provide recommendations and a valuable reference for governmental policy planners.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201406-201407160004-201407160004-53-96,29,2014,NTU Social Work Review

However, the concept of 'local service' was illustrated in a somewhat limited fashion. This research study has two aims: on one hand, to clarify the principle of 'local service' in the project of psychological rehabilitation after the disaster dependent on exploring the documentation; and on the other hand, to analyze the service experience of mental health work teams engaged in the project of psychological rehabilitation following the Typhoon and then recognize the difficulties of providing local services and reflect on the role of the psychiatric social worker. The documents of the service project and interviews with medical team members and local partners were utilized to conduct this research. There were three major findings: firstly, when these medical professionals entered the disaster area, they were unable to adjust their familiar vision and service model; secondly, the central government reconstruction policy treated individual and collective trauma separately, focusing on providing material and short-term assistance and neglecting to repair connections with the community, so that the policy could not in fact contribute to rehabilitation of collective trauma and resulted in a secondary hazard; and thirdly, the psychiatric social worker plays an important role in being the bridge that helps the medical team enter the community, and also take the role of team leader following the progress of reconstruction. This study makes two suggestions: firstly, psychiatric social workers could introduce the ecosystem and strength perspectives to medical team members and assist them in rethinking the teamwork model in non-traditional medical fields together; and secondly, enhance the integration between the various government departments and take the correlations between individual and collective trauma seriously.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201406-201407160004-201407160004-97-148,29,2014,NTU Social Work Review
A Time to Submit and a Time to Resist: The Family Caregiving Struggle of New Immigrant Women from Southeast Asia,"Shih-Ying Cheng, Hon-Yei Yu","family caregiver, submission, new immigrant women from Southeast Asian, patriarchal oppression, resistance","This study investigates the following topics: (1) the experiences as caregivers as new immigrant women from Southeast Asia, (2) the factors influencing these women to submit or resist the role of a caregiver, and (3) the strategies that these women used to negotiate their role. After interviewing 16 new immigrant women from Southeast Asia, four findings were conceptualized. First, these women crossed the ocean to take on the caregiver's role. Second, the factors influencing the women's acceptance of the role were: the gender frame within the ""One Family"" mentality, the dynamics of the women's relations with their in-laws, pragmatic concerns for their situation at home, and the women's acceptance of the family culture of their motherland. While the tactics these women used to resist the role were: laying out acceptable terms and threshold and an-eye-for-an-eye approach after discrimination. As for the strategies of the women to negotiate their roles, they were: power struggle in the domestic arena, communicating the cultural difference, and seeking for replacement caregivers. For these women, the dynamics of their family care- giving experiences were best described as ""a time to submit and a time to resist."" The study also discusses how the combination of patriarchal oppression, family caregiving needs, immigration acts, and family care policies forced these immigrant women to become family caregivers. The resulting family was found to be responsible for further reinforcing patriarchal oppression.

State Supervision in Long Term Care Insurance in Germany,"Yi-Chun Chou, Hsiu-Mei Chuang","long-term care insurance, collective negotiation, quality control, state supervision, needs assessment","With the wave of aging populations, long-term care service is increasingly available to the public and has become the main issue of the world's states. Since the 1970's, because of services-effectiveness and the increased demand for long-term care, social services have progressed toward marketization and diversification. Private profit and non-profit organizations participate in the quasi-market of social services. However, marketization leads to problems of vicious competition and low quality. Therefore, how can the state promote effective supervision of social services market? In Germany, for profit and non-profit organizations are initially accepted as the care service providers for implementing long-term care insurance. Both profit and non-profit organizations account for a high proportion of the market of long-term care service providers, and competition exists. The results of this study showed that competition between profit and non-profit care service providers exists in the German long-term care market but is still under strict state supervision with responsibilities divided between the federal and state governments to avoid the overlap of management concerns. Participation in collective negotiation ac- cording to the role of the long-term care insurer is divided between public and private sectors to achieve the self-determination of social groups. The competitive advents for non-profit organizations; and through the health insurer as a third party to care needs are assessed and service quality is evaluated. These considerations enable the effective state supervision of care service providers in the long-term care insurance market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201406-201407160004-201407160004-199-242,29,2014,NTU Social Work Review

The purpose of this study is to explore the process of adaptation in patients with thalassemia major who have been diagnosed as children, teenagers and in adulthood. The study also analyzes the factors affecting adaptation to severe illness in thalassemia major patients. The study conducts qualitative research to collect data by in-depth interviews of 18 patients with thalassemia major. The results show patients felt suffering and hopelessness in their early stage, however, maturity and responsibilities or employment helped patients to adapt well and prove their value and future after entering adulthood. The positive factors of adaptation are social support, religious beliefs, and medical technology progress, which inspire hope for thalassemia major patients. The risk factors are complications, negative attitudes towards family and social stigma, which affect the survival beliefs of patients.

Art and Social Work Practice,Shu-Yuan Wang,"art, social work, social work practice","Though introductory social work textbooks commonly define social work as an art as well as a science, the artistic side receives little attention today in social work theory, method, or education. The author found the essence and function of art echo social work values and goals, such as evoking deeper human love and feelings, facing up to the real self and leading an authentic life, critical thinking and making individuals peaceful and happy. Also, the practice of social work is very much an art in the sense that each problem situation it undertakes to remedy is invariably unique and one-of-a-kind. To be effective in dealing with unforeseen problems that arise on the job, a social worker must to some extent take the same creative approach the artist does in approaching each new work of art. The solution needs to be beautiful, in the sense that it is felt by everyone involved to be right and to be fitting. The primary resource for success needs to be the ability of the individual social worker to respond from her deepest, most authentic self in a way, and with a degree of self-knowledge, that engages and draws into play the same in the client. Examining these and other similarities between art and social work, this paper concludes by listing various ways in which it would benefit social workers if their education placed more stress on the artistic side of their profession.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201312-201401230002-201401230002-1-46,28,2013,NTU Social Work Review

However, these people seldom speak for themselves or fight for their rights. Thus, this study aims to explore the factors correlated with empowerment in PLWHA.Participants recruited through purposive sampling in all areas in Taiwan, filled out the standard questionnaire to reveal their empowerment scores. The variables associated with empowerment included life satisfaction, HIV internal stigma, types of participation, HIV/AIDS knowledge, medication and demographic data. To test the explanatory power of our model, bivariable and multiple regression analyses were performed. Participants were further classified as intravenous drug users (IDU) or homosexuals.A total of 379 non-repetitive questionnaires were completed. According to statistical analyses, the mean score of empowerment was low. Among all participants, the score was higher on the social-political dimension than on personal and interpersonal ones. Empowerment scores differed by gender and environment variables only for IDU but not for homosexuals. Regression ana-lyses revealed life satisfaction, participation as community representative for residents, HIV/AIDS knowledge and medication compliance were independent factors affecting higher empowerment scores. Our model accounted for 36% of the variance for these variables. For homosexuals but not IDUs, internal HIV stigma was significant in regression analyses.In conclusion, addressing the independent factors in PLWHA and reducing the internal HIV stigma for homosexuals may help to empower PLWHA.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201312-201401230002-201401230002-47-91,28,2013,NTU Social Work Review
An Exploratory Study on Fathers' Use of Paid Parental Leave in Taiwan,"Ting-Hsin Li, Shu-Yung Wang","parental leave fathers, gender role expectation, application motivation, caring experiences","Taiwan's Parental Leave policy was set up in 2002, and most of the applicants are still women. Even though the parental leave allowance has been provided since 2009, the duty of care is still mostly undertaken by women. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to understand the motivations and model of care of fathers who take parental leave.This study uses qualitative research and then interviews nine parental leave fathers to find two main points. First, there is a hierarchical relationship among the main five factors for taking parental leave, including ”personal”, ”family”, ”social environment”, ”occupational structure” and ”the emergence of the problem”. These factors make some fathers ”want to” take, others ”need to” take, and others ”have to” take parental leave. Second, parental leave fathers differ from mothers who are often responsible for the same care work at home. Because fathers can use their time flexibly, they can also clearly separate care work and house work, whereas mothers need to take them all. For most parental leave fathers, caring for a child is just like a relay race, because they can easily pass the baton to the next person. In other words, parental leave fathers still fail to become the primary caregiver, even when they apply for parental leave.Overall, the traditional social stereotypes of gender roles are still firmly embedded in the social structure and they also shape personal behavior. This therefore has a great influence on expecting men to become the breadwinners and expecting women to become the caregivers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201312-201401230002-201401230002-93-135,28,2013,NTU Social Work Review
An Exploration of Multi-Dimensional Assessment and Tools Construction for Family Caregivers in Taiwan,Chih-Chung Huang,"multi-dimensional assessment tools, long-term care, family caregivers, supportive services","Recent shifts in long-term care policies have move away from hospitalization to care in the community and emphasize deinstitutionalization in favor of home- and community-based care options. Success often depends on the essential contribution of family and informal caregivers, who are the backbone of the long-term care system. However, this progress continues to put pressure on family members and friends to take on caregiving roles, despite the risk of negative consequences. These caregivers-generally wives and adult daughters-bear most of the financial, emotional, and physical strain of locating, organizing, and providing care to family members and friends. While policy makers and practitioners increasingly recognize the central role that families play in coordinating and providing long-term care services to frail elders and people with disabilities, these professionals have dedicated little effort to systematic assessment of the situation and the well-being of family members or informal caregivers to determine what assistance they may need. Therefore, an assessment can be the first step toward helping caregivers obtain the information and services they need to maintain their own health and well-being in the face of the caregiving tasks before them. Caregiver assessment may determine eligibility for caregiver support services and can serve as a basis for a care plan and services to support and strengthen family caregivers. This article focuses on assessment from a new perspective, that of the family caregiver. It also justifies the connections between caregiver assessment and supportive services for family caregivers.

There has been much discussion on policies for encouraging fertility. Among which, the implementation of child allowance policy, with the objective of sharing the financial burden of parents with young children, is highly debated.This study aims to demonstrate that child allowance is just one strategy in the entire child welfare package, which illustrates the government's willingness to share the responsibilities of rearing children. The major goal of child allowance is to protect the basic rights of children. Therefore, in addition to exploring the possibility of implementing child allowance, this study emphasizes the importance of introducing other child welfare policies at the same time.On the basis of the study results, we recommend that there should be universal entitlement of child allowance at a flat rate ranging between NT$3,000-NT$5,000. According to the sources of finance, two strategies are proposed.

Subject Construction after Cross-Border: Immigrant Lone Mothers and Their Local and Cross-Border Negotiation,"Shu-Man Pan, Jung-Tsung Yang","immigrant lone mothers, multiple family support programs, local and cross-border negotiation, transnational mothering","Drawing on in-depth interviews with 20 immigrant lone mothers, this paper presents their experiences of local and cross-border negotiation of motherhood. Before becoming lone mothers, marriage immigrant women's strategies of motherhood negotiation are contingent on their responsibility to care for elderly members of their husband's family. If marriage immigrant women are not responsible for caring for the elderly in their husband's family, they tend to resort to extended negotiation of motherhood. If they are responsible for caring for the elderly, they tend to employ compromised negotiation of motherhood. After becoming lone mothers, marriage immigrant women's strategies of practicing motherhood depend on the age of their children. If their children are of pre-school age, immigrant lone mothers tend to use cross-border negotiation or adjustment of their working schedule and location. If their children are of school age, immigrant lone mothers tend to develop local resources or change their jobs. This paper argues that current feminist discourse on mothering and traditional discourse on the good mother cannot adequately interpret these motherhood strategies. These strategies not only challenge traditional and feminist discourses of motherhood but also reveal the empowerment of cross-border negotiation. However, this negotiation only involves immigrant lone mothers and their own mothers still living in their country of origin, the father in Taiwan remains absent. Facing global migration and increasing divorce rate and single parent families, this paper proposes: (1) presenting new discourse on mothering; (2) conducting multiple family support programs; and (3) providing social benefits for (multiple) part time jobs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201206-201307080007-201307080007-135-183,27,2013,NTU Social Work Review

Since the female offenders sample is relatively small (11% of the total), descriptive statistics and Chi-Square have been used in this analysis. The significant result of this study regard to gender differences of intimate partner homicide were as follow: (1) Women were significantly more likely to have actually killed their intimate partners, (2) Males were more likely to have murdered or attempted murder when the relationship were over and separated, however, women generally killed the intimate partners while still in a relationship with them. (3) Male attempted to kill their partners in public places, however, women only killed partners at home. (4) 40% of men (but just 10% of women) had abused their partners before killing. 42% of the women had been victims of battery prior to killing their intimate partners. (5) Among men, the risk of partner abandonment, sexual jealousy, and economic issues were the major motivations to kill; however, self-defense was the most common motivation among women. (6) Regarding to killing method, only men used beating and only women use poison. Because of the gun controlled policy, gun is not easily accessed, knife is the major weapon for both man and women.

Many aboriginal tribes were severely affected. In fear that disaster would strike again, the post-disaster relocation program was enacted. The government enacted ”Forced Resettlement or Village Relocation,” which became a pivotal point of post-disaster reconstruction policy. To allay public doubts on the compulsory village relocation policy, the procedure of ”Reaching Agreement by Consulting with the Original Tenants” was set as a requirement for ”Defining Special Areas.” The process of forced village relocation was divided into 3 phases: assessment, consultation, and settlement. This paper analyzes the present reconstruction and future post-disaster countermeasures by examining research, local reports, and documentation, interviewing the key figures of reconstruction, comparing official statements, and introducing and discussing the phases of post-disaster village relocation. The time pressure for recovery after Typhoon Morakot resulted in significant controversy during the reconstruction process.

Hence, the current study aims to explore how probation and parole officers perceive the effectiveness of polygraph testing in sex offender supervision from a qualitative perspective. Using stratified purposeful sampling, this study collected qualitative data from in-depth interviews with seven probation and parole officers. These data were further analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings indicate polygraph testing acts as a psychological deterrent, and therefore probation and parole officers utilize polygraph testing as an important tool in making or adjusting supervision plans. However, in light of the limitations of polygraph testing, probation and parole officers do not regard polygraph testing as the only important supervisory measure. On the other hand, operant conditioning is presented to explain the shaping process of the offender's internal conditioning resulting from polygraph testing. The ways probation and parole officers use polygraph testing and related issues are discussed. The authors also make recommendations for future research and practitioners' use of polygraph testing in sex offender supervision and treatment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201212-201303180023-201303180023-87-137,26,2012,NTU Social Work Review
Am I a Daughter-in-law or a Care Worker?-A Study on the Formation of the Caretaking Role and the Caretaking Experience of Foreign Daughters-in-law,Chen-Fen Chen,"care burden, family caregiver, immigrant daughter-in-law, long-term care","The purposes of this research include (1) analyzing the factors of foreign daughter-in-law status becoming a career; (2) understanding migrant daughter-in-law's feelings about the caretaking experience; (3) investigating immigrant daughter-in-law stress, and how they cope. Interview data was collected from 13 immigrant daughters-in-law who take care of their disabled parents-in-law. The interviewers were asked to reveal their caretaking experiences in order to discover the hidden meaning behind the phenomena. Data was collected using semi-structured in-depth interviews and scrutinized using thematic analysis. Three essential themes emerged: (1) Why me? How about other daughters-in-law? (2) Am I a daughter-in-law or a care worker? (3) Life becomes difficult for a daughter-in-law, a mother, and a wife at the same time. This study shows that foreign daughters-in-law have little to no support from their husbands' families, and that they feel they are treated more like care workers, or employees, rather than family. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term care policies for immigrant daughters-in-law and for policymakers and service providers to assist this group in relieving caretaker stress.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201212-201303180023-201303180023-139-182,26,2012,NTU Social Work Review

The second issue is especially serious. In accordance with the implementation of the care insurance system in the near future, the participation of profit and non-profit organizations would be expanded to realize the multiplication of care services. According to the perceptions of care service providers in Taiwan, contracts for special entrepreneurs (including public agencies, non-profit organizations, and profit enterprises) would be introduced. Simultaneously, the related state monitoring system should be established to monitor the service quality from different types of service providers and avoid illegal activity.

This study also presents findings by Geographic Information System (GIS), and gives some suggestions for long-term care insurance policy-making.Methods: This study uses the prevalence method in projecting the population who will likely need long-term care services. A demand-based approach is used for the projection of the caring hours and amounts of care workers required.Results: Based on the projection of this study, there will be 347,548 people (1.49% of total population) with at least one ADL in 2011 in Taiwan. Among them, there will be 229,491 people aged 65 and above (9.00% of this sub-population). Including the population with only IADL and dementia, there will be 610,768 people (occupying 2.62% of total population) with long-term care needs in 2011 in Taiwan. In addition, the female elderly population with long term care needs exceeds the male population, and the difference between these two will keep increasing in the near future. Furthermore, based on GIS analysis, the amount of care workers will become insufficient nationwide in many areas, yet foreign care workers could serve within the long-term care system to make up this shortfall.Implications: This study gives four suggestions: (1) An increase in domestic care workers in some regions by the establishment of a long-term care services network having some incentives is necessary; (2) Construction of an integrated and comprehensive long-term care database will assist in confirming the mechanism of communication and policy-making for the different ministries affecting the long-term care field; (3) Increasing the foreign care worker involvement in the long-term care system, and implementing prevocational training regulations for them, should be addressed by articles of law related to the long-term care field, and (4) The establishment of vocational training regulations, and a license/certificate renewing mechanism for domestic/foreign care workers should be initiated immediately.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201206-201209210001-201209210001-51-102,25,2012,NTU Social Work Review

The action was carried out at Taitung County Telay Girls' Home of Good-Shepherd Social Welfare Services Foundation, a teenage girls' residential setting in east Taiwan, from June 2008 to December 2010. Through 4 phases of action cycles, the following results have been found. The process of teenage girls' resilience cultivation is an unstable but continually advancing process. It is also a mutual interactive development process between social workers and girls. The cultivation of individual protective factors should utilize relationships and environmental protective factors at the same time. Social workers should have professional skill competence, the ability to act as mature role models, and commitment to the professional values of social work. In addition, an organization shift is required, involving the redistribution of manpower and resources, and the change of the culture and philosophy of the residential professional group.

The author argues that while most of the mature welfare democracies are faced with fiscal restrictions, they do have adaptive ability to modernize themselves with system restructuring that is dominantly conditioned by the welfare regimes. This paper elaborates the construction of the long-term care insurance in Germany-a typical conservative welfare regime-and its major reform in 2008 with the illustration of core institutional contents, the analysis of achievements, shortcomings, and future challenges. With the demonstration of main characteristics of Bismarckian welfare systems and their potential crises resulting from the new social risks, this paper explores how the Bismarckian welfare state processes the system modernization with the development of mandatory social long-term care insurance when faced with the problems characterized by the fact that the ageing population increases the quality and quantity of care, but the transformation of family and employment structure decreases the possibility of informal care. Taiwan has built a newly emerging Bismarckian welfare state through the social policy expansion since the 1990s and is facing similar problems resulting from the new social risks; hence, lessons learnt from the development of the long-term care insurance in Germany will be especially important to Taiwan for system design and policy implementation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201206-201209210001-201209210001-157-207,25,2012,NTU Social Work Review

Exploring the Sexuality of People with Varied Disabilities: Results from a Qualitative Study,Lien-Chih Chiou,"sexuality, sexual citizenship, disability, human rights","Issues of sexuality and disability have been a taboo topic in the society. However, recent disability legislation, in both international and regional forms, has aimed to ensure basic human rights are also available to the disabled. The human right issue of sexual expression for the disabled has come to point that it cannot be neglected any more.At the same time, feminist groups are advocating the legalization of the sex industry and asserting it may become one of the options for the disabled and underprivileged to exercise their sexual rights. However, those who are against it want to punish sexual consumers to prevent gender oppression of female sex workers. The author believes arguments concerning ”sex worker” penalties or ”consumer” penalties neglect the disadvantaged situation disabled men face in sexual expression. The voices of the disabled are ignored in today's society.From that viewpoint, this paper takes a sexual rights perspective to conduct a bio-social interactive research approach and discuss barriers disabled people face in sexual expression. Through interviewing key people in several non-profit organizations, this paper attempts to portray the sexuality of people with varied disabilities in Taiwan.

"The Myth and Introspection of the Normalization Principle and Individualization Principles for Disability Welfare Service: A Case Study of ""The Foster Family Care Program for Children with Disabilities""",Yi-Chun Chou,"normalization, children and early youths with disabilities, individualization, family foster","The disability welfare service puts emphasis on the ”the normalization principle” and ”the individualization principle.” The former argues that the service for the disables should promote mainstreaming so that they can return to the society to have a normal live; the latter attaches importance to the disables' special needs. By exploring a unique program for foster family care for the children and early youth with disabilities in northern Taiwan, this article discusses the practical application of the two principles. This foster family care program, which has been implemented for 5 years, is quite distinctive because it is one of the scopes of business of the Disabled Welfare Section in the local government. After analyzing relative documents and conducting in-depth interviews, this article found that although this program tries to conform to ”the normalization principle” by promoting the disabled children and early youth to live in the foster family rather than in the placement agency, the negative results are produced due to the too long foster period and the limited effectiveness of reconstruction of these disabled children's and early youth's native families. Thus this article argues that how ”the normalization principle” and ”the individualization principle” can be effectively applied to the disability welfare service should be further explored.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201112-201203140025-201203140025-88-134,24,2011,NTU Social Work Review

To cope with these problems, the Labour Government proposed the new community programme, New Deal for Communities (NDC). The NDC intended to solve the difficulties faced the deprived areas and to alleviate the phenomenon of social exclusion. For the past decade, the reports of the NDC evaluation have been published in succession. This paper aims to discover the contents, strategies and operational model of the NDC from the perspective of community governance. After analyzing the contents and reflecting the experiences of community work in Taiwan, this paper concluded some implications and lessons of the NDC experiences for future Taiwan’s community work. The implications include: (1) Rethinking the community definition and range; (2) Readjusting the government's role and function; (3) Elaborating the role of citizen of community residents; (4) Protecting equal opportunity for deprived communities; (5) Promoting the evidence-based community projects (6) Constructing an integrated mechanism for policy implementation; and (7) Reviewing the performance of community development and community building. The lessons include: (1) Poor management for partnership cannot achieve better community development; (2) Community development work is unsuitable to overly rely on significant individual; (3) Community problems cannot be solved entirely only by intervention through community level; (4) Community conflict which is hard to solve will be harmful to community development; and (5) Stable and long-term financial expenditure is not guaranteed to sustainable community development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201106-201108060012-201108060012-1-45,23,2011,NTU Social Work Review
Political Democratization and Social Policy: Exploring the Impact of Political Institutions on the Pension Scheme-Building in Taiwan,"Shih-Jiunn Shi, Yu-Man Yeh","Taiwan, social policy, national pension insurance, political institutionalism, veto point","Since 1990s, Taiwan has put National Pension Insurance scheme on the political agenda, and finalized the version in 2008 after decade-long discussions by various government mechanisms and many interest groups in Taiwan's civil society. This article seeks to employ the perspective of political institutionalism in order to identify the form of 'veto points' in the pension policymaking against the background of democratization. Based on the literature review, secondary data analysis, and expert interviews, we explore the impact of changing political institutions and institutional veto points on policy ideas, interests and institutional frameworks of the National Pension Insurance. The main finding is that, under the constraints of the minority government and political tensions between ruling and opposition parties during the democratic deepening phase (i.e. after year 2000), the policymaking process of the National Pension Insurance scheme has been bogged down by the interplay of pluralized, if not contradictory, political and social interests, leading to political impasse and policy fluctuations. In National Pension policy domain, we have witnessed fragmentary power relations in political institutions as well as pluralization of social interest intermediation. Although these changing contexts have indeed facilitated the contestation of different ideas conducive to the convergence of policy consensus, the result is that these contexts inevitably tended to precipitate inconsistent policy developments. The present study should demonstrate the explanatory power of political institutionalism and veto points in accounting for pension policy evolution within the context of democratic transformation, and offer rationales for the application of these theoretical viewpoints in the future research of social policy in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201106-201108060012-201108060012-47-91,23,2011,NTU Social Work Review

First, immigrant wives certainly suffer inferiority in Taiwan. Their lives are overshadowed by racialization, the negative media images of foreign brides, and the operation of profit-pursuing marriage agents. Second, immigrant wives are active agents drawing on strengths rather than passive victims. They have capacities, talents, competencies, and possibilities to cope with structural coercion and resist discriminatory gaze, i.e. transforming problems of language barrier into linguistic capital, pursuing economic empowerment, and reviving energies by negotiating with gender culture. These findings not only challenge the existing research results but also remind social work practitioners of widening understandings of these women.

This study employed a cross-sectional survey design using a convenience sample of 310 mental health consumers who were members in community mental health agencies (the rehabilitation centers or the half-way houses) in Taiwan and 26 practitioners who were familiar with these participated consumers. Social functioning was measured using an adapted Chinese version of the Social Functioning Scale (SFS), which is developed by Song (2001).

Objective recovery from mental illness was assessed through the adapted Chinese version of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. A series of hierarchical multiple-regression models were used.There were the significant association between social functioning and subjective recovery from mental illness. Persons with mental illness having higher level of social functioning were more likely to have better level of subjective recovery from mental illness. In addition, there were significant association between social functioning and five sub-dimensions of subjective recovery: goal and success orientation, personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, self-help, and not dominated by symptoms.

With regard to the level of poverty, between 1988 and 2006, poverty in Taiwan exhibits an interrelated tendency of three reverse-U shapes tilting toward the right-hand side. 2. Among the poor, the percentage of the unemployed household breadwinners climbs significantly, while the percentage of working poor declines. 3. Even though the growth of income retains its function of reducing poverty, it is less significant as a factor than the unequal redistribution of income is in reducing poverty; the fact that the extent to which different sectors benefit from the growth of income varies raises serious doubt on the presumption of a so-called ”trickling down effect”.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201012-201106150096-201106150096-109-151,22,2010,NTU Social Work Review

The data indicates that the number of social work departments in Taiwan has doubled and the number of social work students has increased by 150% between 1997 and 2010. Correspondingly, the number of social work faculty has doubled. However, the proportion of professional staff holding degree in social work/social welfare/social policy remains low. With regard to the curriculum, the national social worker certification exam is a major influence on the design of curriculum for social work programs. More social work programs provide concentrations by field of practice than previously, but the minimum credit hour requirement for each concentration varies among institutions. In short, Taiwanese social work education today is short of professional faculty, effective curriculum mapping, clear-cut course concentrations, and distinction between undergraduate course levels.

According to these laws, social workers have to enter the police departments, prosecutors' office and courts to advocate for their clients. Therefore, social workers have more interactions with police officers, prosecutors and judges. This paper aimed to examine the three professionals' interactive experiences with social workers, and explore the impacts of social worker's legal advocacy. This study collected opinion from judges, prosecutors and police officers who were in charge of domestic violence and sex assault cases. Results from this study suggest that police officers have great understanding about the role of social workers, and more likely to make requests to social worker's assistance, compared with prosecutors and judges. However, results also suggest that police officers feel more frustrated from cooperation with social workers. Moreover, the results indicate that the relationships with social workers are different among the judge, prosecutors and police officers. Social workers have imbued and change the culture of these three systems gradually. In addition, police officers, prosecutors and judges perceive that providing service for victims in the justice system is the social welfare agency's responsibility, rather than theirs. The regression analysis results indicate that the social worker's professional ability is the most important factor associated with these three professionals' opinions on the impacts of social worker's advocacy. Finally, this study proposes five suggestions for practice fields service programs and future studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201006-201011300187-201011300187-1-53,21,2010,NTU Social Work Review
Examining News Coverage of Celebrity Domestic Violence-Spreading Myths or Providing Prevention Education?,Du Jane,"social construction, domestic violence, news report, media advocacy, prevention education","This research used discourse analysis and concept of ”news scheme” to examine the media's coverage of these stories. After analyzing 390 electronic news reports, we found that ”interpersonal interaction” is the dominant discourse, which states that poor communication skills of husband and wife is the main cause of domestic violence. This discourse underlies the myth of ”blaming the victim” that holds the victim responsible for being abused. Meanwhile, solutions for preventing domestic violence are heavily focused on the victim's self-help action. In comparison, the responsibility of the perpetrator is seriously neglected. Victim-focus discourse may easily transfer the accountability of preventing domestic violence from society to victims. Additionally, some skeptics suspect the victim intends to utilize the law and media attention for personal benefit. Active media advocacy is suggested to enhance the media's educational function in preventing domestic violence. In addition, we suggest that news reports focus more on the perpetrator's responsibility and social responsibility in order to build a zero-tolerance attitude toward violence as well as a commitment to structural reform of domestic violence prevention in the community.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201006-201011300187-201011300187-55-113,21,2010,NTU Social Work Review
"Premium Arrears, Drop-out, and NHI Relief Program in 2003","Jen-Huoy Tsay, Mei-Chiue Lin","premium subsidy, the uninsured, premium arrears, national health insurance, disenrollment","In respect to an increasing number of enrollees who dropped out the National Health Insurance (NHI) program due to premium arrears, the Bureau of National Health Insurance enacted a 1-year premium relief program for the economically underprivileged people in 2003. Eligible beneficiaries could apply for either premium waiver or installment according to their economic status. This study aims to analyze the characteristics of program participants using the NHI administration data. The results show that 205,754 individuals or 107,272 households were mainly aged between 15-44, male, unemployed, those who were conventionally excluded from formal social assistance systems. In addition, by analyzing the tax information of sample (5% of households), the results indicate that a majority of the program participants were marginally above the poverty line, and hence, they were not qualified as low-income to be exempted from the NHI premium. Moreover, although this 1-year program had protected this near-poor population's temporary access to care from 2003 to 2004, the outstanding arrears and new premium payments will continue to accumulate after the termination of this relief program. Clearly, they won’t be able to afford such a large financial burden. Therefore, a more generous and long-term premium subsidy policy, instead of a short-term relief program, is critical for the near poor. Besides, the results show that over 10% of sampled households were quite affluent in contrast with the household income of the general population. Therefore, the study suggests that the premium subsidy criteria should be either exclusively income-tested or income-tested in complement to a categorical arrangement for specific population groups.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-201006-201011300187-201011300187-115-152,21,2010,NTU Social Work Review
"Beyond the Story of ""Willing Burden"": The Day-to-Day Practices and Policy Recommendations for Young Carers",Jessie Shu-Yun Wu,"young carers, caring experience, child and juvenile welfare","Young carers experience a double jeopardy owing to their dual role as carers and as children. To date, studies in Taiwan on the issue of care-giving have largely concentrated on the situation of adult carers and female care-givers in particular. As such, little attention has been paid to young carers. However, involvement in caring can have adverse influences on a child or young person's physical and emotional development as well. In addition, the impact of caring activities on young caregivers differs from that on adult carers. The caring tasks and experiences involved also distinguish young carers from other non-caring children and young people. These issues pose a challenge to the current welfare system: to what extent has state policy been in concordance with young carers' needs?
This article aims to learn about the characteristics and everyday practices of children or young people who take responsibilities of care towards their family members. Further more, this study is oriented to analyze young caregivers' needs for services and their expectation of the corresponding welfare strategies required from government. With the intention of raising professional and public awareness on the situation of young carers, here might be a tendency of growth nationwide support services aimed specifically at this group.
This article concludes that: first, schools should be placed as essential points to identify young carers; second, young carers should be able to exercise the right to ask for their needs to be assessed and fulfilled; third, the ”whole family” approach could be adopted when working with young carers; fourth, relevant organizations could address the needs of young carers and to coordinate each aspect of professional intervention.

Using the data of 1982-1986, 1988-1992, and 1996-2000 Labor Forces Utilization Surveys, this study found that: (1) In general, the perspective of recession-push rather than prosperity-pull is more appropriate to explain the emergence of the self-employed in Taiwan. Given some characteristics controlled, the probability of becoming the self-employed is significantly higher in the recession stage than in the prosperous stage. (2) Once the sample was divided into primary versus secondary labor markets, the perspective of recession-push is still valid to explain the emergence of the self-employed in the secondary labor market. However, the perspective of prosperity-pull is more appropriate to explain the emergence of the self-employed in the primary labor market. (3) Finally, those disadvantageous populations, such as the married, the older, the less-educated, and rural workers, tend to become the self-employed.

The Dynamics of Economic Provisions Derived from the Cases of TFCF: An Example of Chiayi Branch (1967-2008),"Chao-Hsien Leu, Te-Mu Wang, Yi-Ting Lin, Ming-Yen Sen","child welfare, benefit dynamics, income support, TFCF","Our study establishes a set of pseudo panel data based on the income assistance case records from 1967 to 2008 of Chiayi Branch Office, Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF), and uses such data to analyze the benefit dynamics of the income assistance cases of TFCF. The results are as follows:
1. Among the income assistance cases of TFCF, 66.59% of the children weren't included in the statutory assistance system. It seems that the TFCF program has the capacity and function to meet up with the shortcomings of the statutory welfare provision.
2. Demographic profile are the main factors preventing children from receiving income assistance, while income variables are the main factors that cause children withdrawing from income assistance.
3. Family disorganization is the main demographic variables causing children to receive income assistance, often highly unrecoverable, and results in the family transformation from nuclear to single-parent one. In addition, disorganized families are often more economically-disadvantaged.
4. Children-ship is the main reason why families can last longer and kids play an important role motivating family to leave from income assistance program.
Accordingly, we suggest that the government needs to see children as public goods, and offer them and their families the welfare benefit not ”depending on” earners. The government should set up risk assessment mechanism in order to provide various economically-disadvantaged families with comprehensive service, and make sure all children can grow up in a fair and friendly environment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200912-201004010079-201004010079-57-92,20,2009,NTU Social Work Review
"Wellbeing, Quality of Life and Social Policy: Implications in Relation to the Financial Tsunami",David Phillips,"quality of life, wellbeing, social policy, financial crisis","The last major international financial tsunami, starting in 1929, led to a decade of world-wide economic depression, mass unemployment and political instability culminating in a world war. One of the major factors that could lead to international political instability in the present crisis is the threat of economic protectionism by the major trading countries. Already the American government is introducing ”buy American” clauses in its policies which is causing concern to the People's Republic of China. Central to the threat of international instability is national stability, political, economic and social. And our wellbeing and quality of life are major determinants of national stability. Mass homelessness, unemployment, poverty and a sense of hopelessness were endemic in the 1930s. It is social policy which can address these quality of life issues. This paper deals with the implications for the relationship between quality of life, wellbeing, and social policy of the contemporary tumultuous financial catastrophes. The first part of the paper defines quality of life and social policy and explores the relationship between them, utilising Titmuss's construct of the social division of welfare. This is followed by a brief exploration of the extent and consequences of the financial tsunami for quality of life. The paper finishes with an analysis of the implications of the financial crisis for social policy and for quality of life. The conclusions are rather bleak in material terms but it is also argued that the contemporary financial crisis provides an opportunity for us-both as individuals and as nations-to reconsider the balance between material and non-material aspects of wellbeing and quality of life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200912-201004010079-201004010079-93-131,20,2009,NTU Social Work Review

Therefore, if a comprehensive and continuous family treatment service is to be provided, the integration across related organizations has to be done. In order to enhance the cooperative efficiency among local children/youths protection case work teams across related organizations, this study utilizes four times' discussion data of a focus group for analysis, which is taken from ”The study on the construction of the children/youths protection service and resource network platform” conducted by the author of this study. It is hoped that from the points of view of practitioners, important factors for enhancing cooperative efficiency could be found. After four times' discussions of the focus group, it is found that the focus group has gotten consensus on the issue of cooperation under the policy support; however, if some modification and adjustment could be done, cooperative efficiency would be improved. Therefore, based on the discussion results, important factors for enhancing cooperative efficiency are summarized as follows:
(1) To clearly define the service role function of every organization in the work team
(2) To thoroughly carry out the work model of case management
(3) To design children/youths protection evaluation tools including high-risk family concept
(4) To integrate service recording forms
(5) To establish case service information system

The data was collected from thirty-five social workers and six educators working with these victims. This study employed a qualitative method-focus-group interviews-to collect data. The results showed that the barriers resulted from social workers themselves include: (1) the deficiency of professional knowledge about the characteristics of victims with intellectual disabilities, and (2) the dilemma such as whether to report the victim. A barrier factor resulted from cooperating with other professionals was the pressure due to the high expectation from other professionals. Five challenges toward social-work service system were arrived include the strategies to prevent more people with intellectual disability from sexual victimization. Three challenges concluded from findings about social workers themselves include: (1) to improve the in-service training for social workers, (2) to emphasize on case-management of victims, (3) to improve community protection initiatives for adults with intellectual disability. Two more challenges were found about the systematic and cooperative service-mechanism building. Social workers reflected that there is a need on special education teachers to help them communicate with the victims. Also, the integration of resources would be helpful for the implementation of social work.

It also took a series of measures to promote employment opportunity, such as the ”sustainable employment project.” The research has employed documentary analysis and Delphi method to evaluate the impacts of those employment promotion programs. According to the results of Delphi method, ”reemployment rate” was regarded as the most important indicator for evaluating the effect of employment promotion programs. The other two indicators were ”the fulfillment of program objectives” and ”the duration of reemployment”. Several suggestions are made. First, the characters of the unemployed should be carefully analyzed in order to match them with appropriate employment programs. Second, different measures are actually interrelated with each other. Those measures should be integrated for providing a package employment service. Third, those with better employability are suitable for job training schemes or loans; the others are suitable for public work or wage subsidy sachems.

Using the data of Income and Expenditure Survey, this paper computes the values of the SST index and its three constituents, child poverty rates, average poverty gap ratios among the poor children, and the Gini index values of poverty gap ratios among all children, in Taiwan from 1979 to 2005.
The SST index reached its highest levels and indicated the worst levels of child poverty in late 1980s and early 1990s among the entire studied period. The SST fluctuations are driven by variations of poverty rates and mostly by changes of average poverty gap ratios. Strikingly the Gini index portrays a totally different picture. The Gini index hit its lowest levels and revealed the lowest inequality in the distribution of poverty gap ratios among children in late 1980s and early 1990s.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200812-x-18-191-229-a,18,2008,NTU Social Work Review

Yet in searching through the curriculum of social work departments in Taiwan, the textbooks used in Taiwan to train social workers, and even the various ethical codes social workers in Taiwan are held to, the author found little mention of occupational risk in the profession. What she found was that, in Taiwan at least, the occupational risk of social work is effectively ignored by the educational system. She argues that it is unethical for educational system not to prepare students of social work for the dangers they will encounter in the field and introduce them to strategies to deal with these.

Volunteeringin the Chi-Chi Earthquake: A Preliminary Analysis,Chao-Hsien Leu,"civic engagement, volunteering, disaster","If disasters are viewed as the social events, the prevention of disasters and disaster rescue should take the cooperation among different social units into consideration. Also, volunteers are one of the most important forces of disaster rescue. The rich knowledge on the human resources of volunteering will be helpful for the design of the prevention of disasters and disaster rescue. Therefore, my study is focused upon three research questions: (1) After the 921 earthquake, what attributes do the volunteers who engage in the disaster rescue works hold? (2) In comparison to the general volunteer works, what different factors affect people's decisions of participating into the disaster rescue volunteer works? (3) Will disasters have impact upon people's future willingness to involve in volunteer works?
In conclusion, after the 921 earthquake, there is no convergence among the human resources of volunteers, but among other philanthropic resources, such as money donation, blood donation and other necessity donation, the convergence is evident. Although the disaster victims take the advantages from the convergence of the resources, the convergence provoke the deduction of the resources used in other non-earthquake-disaster rescue philanthropic activities. Secondly, the factors that affect people's decisions of participating into the disaster rescue volunteer work can be separated into two categories: the situation conditions, and the capability conditions. However, there is trade-off between the disaster rescue volunteer work and the other general volunteer work. And as the time passes by, the philanthropic behavior induced by the situation conditions has less and less influence upon people's willingness to involve in volunteer works. Finally, my study finds that for the people outside the disaster area, the disaster rescue volunteer works are just the extension of their ordinary volunteer works. Although in the short term, it has deep impact upon the residents of the disaster area, in the long term, it has no significant influence on the existing civic engagement model.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200806-x-17-131-168-a,17,2008,NTU Social Work Review

"Discussion on the Environmental Construction and Practical Ideas of ""Unit Care"" Service Model",Hsiu-Mei Chuang,"practical ideas, it care, environmental construction","For the rising of demand in the aged welfare, the long-term care service model has changed a lot in recent years. The care models for the elderly have been developed gradually since 1970s.. In the beginning of 21 centuries, one of long-term care policy, the ”new nursing home for elderly” based on the ”unit care” ideas has reframed the long-term care service model. ”New nursing home for elderly” is a ”small scale life unit” type of nursing home, whose characters include ”single room”, ”pay for housing rent”, and ”the small group unit care (Unit Care)”. The ”Unit Care” is not only popular care service model in Japan; it also attracts attention in Taiwan in the recent year. This article will enrich the debates of ”Unit Care”, which can improve the understanding of ”Unit Care” model in Taiwan.
This article will help us to understand the practical experiences of ”Unit Care” in Japan, and thinking the implement of the ”Unit Care” service model for elderly in Taiwan.
The following issues were discussed in the article:
1. The analysis on the developmental background of ”Unit Care” service model in Japan, which has impacted ”group home” and the practice of long-term Care Insurance System.
2. The law system, environmental construction and practical ideas of ”Unit Care” were discussed.
3. The states of ”Unit Care” service model focused on the development of advancing care service in the nursing homes.
4. The effects of the ”Unit Care” on the practices field in nursing home were introduced.
5. The suggestions in the practice of ”Unit Care” were provided for Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200801-x-16-87-127-a,16,2008,NTU Social Work Review
Research of Unit Care in the Medicare Institution: A Case Study in Pingtung,"Song-Lin Huang, Hui-Yin Liu, Hsiu-Yueh Hsu","medicare institution, unit care, time for willingness of residents leaving beds, daily steps of care workers","The elderly population in Pingtung County has risen to 11.75 per cent of the total population. There are more than 50 homes for the elderly in Pingtung County. Most of them are small medicare homes with less than 50 beds. Since 2000, the 'unit care', which has been promoted for several years in Japan, is regarded as a unique one for caring for disabled elderly people today. It is especially appropriate for elderly people with dementia. This research tried to promote a Unit Care Model Project and it included social and nursing care services. In this research, daily steps of care workers were taken into account to measure the work load under the Unit Care Model Project. In addition, time for willingness to leave beds of residents to join interactions and an investigation of satisfaction with services were also utilized to measure the quality of service. Findings were illustrated as follows: daily steps of care workers kept rising from the first week to the 14(superscript th) week and lessened after the 15(superscript th) week. After the 19(superscript th) wee, it was even less than the beginning of the project. This shows that the work load of care workers has been lower than at the beginning of the project. In addition, time for willingness of residents leaving beds increased significantly during the first two weeks and then gradually decreased. The scores were significantly higher than at the beginning of the project. Our findings were similar to the researchers in the Japanese study.

Effects of Governmental Income Transfers on Poverty Reduction for Elderly Households: A Case Study of Elderly Poverty from 1990 to 2000,Hua-Chin Ho,"poverty gaps, governmental income transfers, elderly household, poverty rates","From recent household poverty trends, some researchers have found that the poverty rate for elderly households has been declining. After examining their family resources, we discovered that government income transfers were one of their major income sources. The focus of this study is to determine whether the decline in the elderly poverty rate was caused by the infusion of government income transfers. This study first measured the changes in the family resources of elderly households before and after the transfers, and then analyzed the differences to understand the effects of the transfers on the overall poverty rates among elderly households.
One of this study's findings is that, from 1990 to 2000, government income transfers were relied on by single elderly person households and elderly couple households, and had certain effects on lowering their poverty rates and narrowing their poverty gaps. In other words, government income transfers did lessen the adversity of these elderly households in poverty. Among the types of elderly households, single elderly person household had the most visible improvement with the largest decrease in both the poverty rate and poverty gap; the effects of government income transfers were most prominent for this type of household in the period from 1990 to 2000.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200710-x-15-89-120-a,15,2007,NTU Social Work Review
The Modulation of a Prime Suite: Study on Adolescents' Joining the Adult Gangs in Taiwan,"Chang-O Wu, Hon-Yei Annie Yu","adult gang, adolescent, organized crime, school drop-out","The phenomenon of adolescents' joining the adult gangs has been a social concern in Taiwan. This study explores the young gangsters' experiential journey of organized crime from their perspectives. Based on the seniority, student status/or not, and role played in their gangs, eight adolescents from a reformatory in northern Taiwan have been sampled to proceed with in-depth interview on their background and experiences with the adult gangs.
It is found that marital violence witness, school drop-out, being suffered from father-son tension as well as bad relationship on campus have been the crucial environmental factors to predict later adult gang membership. Furthermore, the interplay among personal motivation, characteristics, and circumstances contributes to an adolescent's becoming an adult gang member, taking order, and later leaving the gang. An adolescent's motivation of joining an adult gang and the following order taking will have impact on his status setting in the adult gang, and accordingly, the benefit as well as risk sharing to break the law. High income from illegal activities part-taking and the sense of accomplishment shape the young gangsters’ materialist life style and value system which push them even closer to the adult gangs. However, the damage caused by illegal assignment operation and gang fighting has been a threat to the adolescent gangsters.
Their families usually do not know their gang status due to the adolescents' careful disguise. For those who decide to leave the adult gang, back to their families of origin or to have their own families is their hope. Their relationship with the adult gang leaders is based on mutual interest, while compliance with gang rules has been varied among adolescent members. They may voluntarily turn themselves in to the police just in order to cover for other adult gangsters due to the code of honor. And they usually have negative experiences with the police and justice system. All the adolescent inmates expect to have a refreshing start after being discharged from the reformatory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200710-x-15-121-166-a,15,2007,NTU Social Work Review
The Projections of Expenditures and Financing for Long-Term Care in Taiwan,"Ching-Hsia Cheng, Peter Wen-Hui Cheng","expenditure projection, long-term care, financing system","To meet the rapidly increasing need of long-term care in Taiwan, the government is urgently called to develop a formal public long-term care system, which may lessen the care burden of the family and also upgrade the quality of care. This study aims to project the long-term care expenditure and to investigate the important issues related to the design of the financial system of long-term care for social insurance and tax-funded system.
The major findings from this study are four-fold： (1) People with disability is expected to almost double from 660 thousands to 1.26 millions during 2006-2031;(2) Projected long-term expenditures as the percentage of GDP, according to medium estimate, are between 0.52-0.62% during 2006-2031 for social insurance, and 0.31-0.56% for tax-funded system；(3) On the other hand, the projected burdens on the government are expected to be lower under social insurance, between 21.5-49.6 billion NT dollars during 2006-2031, than those under tax-funded system, between 33-112.3 billion dollars for the same period. (4) Fluctuating sizes of generations create variations in tax rates. To facilitate the soundness of finance, pre-funding is a suggested cure for this variation. We suggested that the social insurance rate may be adjusted every ten years for social insurance and the tax rate may be adjusted every five years for tax-funded system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200710-x-15-167-218-a,15,2007,NTU Social Work Review
Professional Autonomy? Organizational Self-interest?-Creaming Issues in the Contracting of Placement Services for the Disadvantaged Youth,"Joanne S. C. Liu, Hui Peng","contracting-out, creaming, placement Services for the disadvantaged youth, third-party contracts, organizational self-interest","Fair and equal accessibility is an issue that attracts most attention in the privatization of social services. Often criticized under the contracting regime is the contractor's tendency to avoid those cases that are more difficult or cost more. This paper, using Placement Services for the Disadvantaged Youth (PSDY) as an example, explores whether the contracting process favors certain type of clients, resulting in those clients with multiple, complex, and chronic problems can only receive less quality services or worse even are refused of services, creating the so-called ”social service passed-over”. This paper's conclusion includes several points: the contracting process of PSDY is a quadripartite relationship that is more complex than the ”third party contracts”. Differences in professional decisions and poor collaboration between the departments within the Department of Social Welfare leads to insufficient definition of service, makes effective contract management difficult, provides minimum protection of client accessibility. Consequently, contractors, by using their information collected at the interview sessions as well as their professional expertise, were able to choose cases, i.e. ”creaming”. After allowing clients' inhabitation, contractors are still able to manipulate and create situations for clients to withdraw. With an objective to maximize profits, contractor's model for operation becomes ”maximum professional fee with minimum caseload”. The authors's opinion is that the performance evaluation or performance-based contracting may not be the reasons for contractor's case picking. Defining service requirements without considering specific needs of individual clients may be the cause for contractor's opportunist behavior. The resources made available and attention paid by the Placement Services of the local government have direct bearing on the clout the contract managers have in dealing with contractor's performance. This paper presents four recommendations: classifications of service requirements (cases); maintaining an in-house production of services within the government; reasonable cost accounting to ensure sufficient resources, establishing a central referral system, and designing a meaningful performance evaluation mechanism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200701-x-14-61-121-a,14,2007,NTU Social Work Review

At this time, the net monetary benefit for the participants is more likely to be positive. It shows that this program is likely to be efficient and equal for the whole society. If considering social benefit stream, it is very possible that the social net monetary benefit can be at least $NT71,447.19 per participant. The benefit cost ratio will be 2.480 then. In addition, the annual social net monetary benefits are positive and keep rising between 2003 to 2005.

The Dynamics of Poverty and Its Causes: From Life Cycle to Life Course,Chao-Hsien Leu,"Life Cycle, Poverty Dynamics, Life Course","”Poverty dynamics” is the conception used to discuss how and why poverty status shifts during individual's (or family's) different life periods. Since the mid 1970's, American poverty researchers have already applied longitudinal data to analyze the problem of poverty dynamics. In the late 1980's, such new theme of poverty study began to attract the attentions of European and other countries' researchers. However, most of these researchers viewed such conception just as a special statistic method for data analysis. The topics about the perspectives of explaining poverty dynamics hadn't ever been explicated thoroughly. Thus, standing against the background of the development of American welfare policies, which have produced rich outcomes on poverty dynamics, my study attempted to define the historical periods of the development of the perspectives of explaining poverty dynamics, to examine the implications and limitations of existing perspectives, and relations among different ones, and to provide some suggestions for future studies. My study expected that such review of different discourses about poverty dynamics in the historical periods would be helpful for the establishment of the relevant welfare policies and the development of the studies on poverty dynamics in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200701-x-14-167-210-a,14,2007,NTU Social Work Review

It was revealed that related study started in 1985, the amount showed increasingly since 1991, and reached the peak between 2003 and 2004. Based on amount of the bibliographical types of researches, we found masters or doctoral theses were the primary, government funding research reports were the second, and the journal articles were the third.
Based on amount of the fields of the researches, we found the sequence from the most to the least were corrections, psychology, social work, medical study, education, judicial study, policing, and journalism. Based on the amount of types of authors, the graduate students were in the majority, the scholars were the second, and then the practitioners.
According to the purpose of research, it was explored that the studies regarding the typology and characteristics of sex offenders, and the experience and the characteristics of sex offense victims were the majority in the past 20 years. The treatment process and efficacy, judicial program evaluation, establishing assessment tools, sex offense prevention education, and treatment program evaluation were popular topics recently. Establishing working model might be a topic need to be focused in the future. The experience of victims' families and the experience of treatment providers were the attractive topics in the past three years.

The researcher designed semi-structured questions and conducted one-to-one interviews with 12 teenage females who experienced pregnancy and became unwed teenage mothers.
The results showed that when teenage females knew they were pregnant, the feelings they experienced included nervousness, fear, shock, denial, mood swings and worries. However they still decide to keep the babies because of the following reasons: 1. They didn’t want to have the guilty feeling of killing babies. 2. It was too late for abortion. 3. They desired to experience motherhood, 3. gender of the baby made the difference, and 4. They were not able to afford the abortion fees.
The reasons they decided to stay in temporary mid-way shelters during pregnancy included: 1. They did not want others to know they were pregnant. 2. Their family members could not accept the fact of their pregnancy. 3. Their family members could not provide help in their pregnancy period. 4. They could receive proper care, and could have serene time for new life planning. While staying at shelters, they lived a routine life, but sometimes still felt lonely and bored. Although shelters provided care and security , these teenage pregnant females still had unsettled hearts. They pondered whether they had the ability to keep babies or should give up for adoption, or married with a born child. Findings also showed that some unwed teenage mothers first wanted to raise their own babies, but due to their young age and poor financial status, they finally gave up their babies for adoption. In addition, they also needed to decide whether they had to start working, return to school, or raise their own children. The needs unwed teenage mothers had were: proper living places, financial, medical, and educational provision, parenting skills, child welfare, counseling and law assistance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200610-x-13-41-107-a,13,2006,NTU Social Work Review

During sampling, the method of stratified proportion rate is used. Then, 526 copies of questionnaires are sent and 516 valid ones are obtained. The ratio of valid samples is 98 per cent, and the gender ratio of the valid samples to the population is homogeneous. The findings show that the most influential family resources that affect the family life quality of the 516 single-parent families are manpower & social capital followed by economic capital and family relation feeling capital. For the male single-parent families, what influences the life quality of children education dimension is mainly family relation feeling resources followed by information resources. As for the female single-parent families, manpower & social capital comes in the first place, and then the information resources. With regard to the reasons of single-parent family, if it is due to divorce, the only family resources factor that would influence the family life quality is family relation feeling resources; but if the reason is caused by the death of one parent, the family life quality would be influenced most by the family relation feeling resources followed by service resources. In general, the valid factors that influence the life quality of the samples in this study mainly come from the system within the family , next the system outside the family , and single-parent families is investigated, and its gender ratio is in homogeneity with the population, which make the results of this study cannot fully represent the situations of all single-parent families in Kaohsiung City.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200610-x-13-109-171-a,13,2006,NTU Social Work Review

The married women of the growth group express they are generally responsible for maintaining the cohesion and unity of their families. As a result, caring for those within kinship networks becomes their responsibility, one that must be fulfilled to keep peace within their families. As some women reveal, the resources of their original families have been allocated unequally between daughters and sons. The multiple demands of their original family members on their time and money causes tension because the obligations to care are not embedded in a pattern of reciprocity.

The Role of 'Personal Assistance': The Case of Visual Assistant Service,王育（王兪）,"visual assistant, visually impaired people, personal assistant, personal assistance, disabled people","Since 1980s, the United Nations has been advocating for the 'full participation and equality' of disabled people. 'Personal Assistance' is one key factor in bringing the idea of guaranteeing disabled people's rights into practice. Disabled people's needs for personal assistance are multi-dimensional, which include: daily life, education, employment, etc.. In Taiwan, however, there are services provided to 'care for' disabled people but not to support disabled people at work. In view of this, The Cultural and Educational Foundation for the Blind (CEFB) developed a pilot scheme which provided 'visual assistant service' for visually impaired persons.
The aim of this study is to understand how visually impaired users experienced the service and how the service met the needs, as well as the views of the project workers and visual assistants. The main findings are: First, the 'visual assistant service' has improved visually impaired workers' sense of control at work, and reduced their enforced reliance on their informal support systems. Nevertheless, they have little control over the way the services were provided. In addition, the author suggests some points to improve in the future, regarding the dimensions of services provided, the monitor of the program, enhanced communication with employers and more efforts on job accommodation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200512-x-12-89-139-a,12,2005,NTU Social Work Review

There are many differences in the characteristics of product and service quality, in particular in the field of personal social service. Social service quality can be defined in terms of 'objective' factors or 'subjective' perceptions of service users. The perspectives of social service quality have developed from the traditional approach, the 'scientific' or expert approach, the managerial or 'excellence' approach to the consumerist approach, and then to the democratic approach. These approaches have contributed to the production of quality elements of social services, including objective and subjective elements, in particular the democratic one. In practice, the improvement or promotion of social service quality has experienced various challenges and barriers. A modern social service needs a modern quality management strategy. This paper provides four main strategies: (1) changing the professional and managerial culture, (2) constructing a newly social service system, including open, responsiveness, standard approach, audit subsystems; (3) Involving stakeholders in policy-decision and provision process, and further achieving their commitments; and (4) Investing staff. These strategies are related and in relation to the implementation of various elements of social service quality.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200506-x-11-45-87-a,11,2005,NTU Social Work Review

The Phenomenon of Poverty in Taiwan: A Review of Research,Yeong-Tsyr Wang,"Income Inequality, The feminization of poverty, Poverty","The paper describes and analyzes the phenomenon of poverty in Taiwan based upon the related government reports and empirical research. The main topics of this paper include: (1) the concept of poverty, (2) theoretical perspectives on poverty, (3) the poverty trends, (4) poverty differences between rural and urban areas, (5) poverty among women, (6) poverty among the elderly, (7) poverty among children, (8) ethnic groups, (9) the homeless, (10) the issue of time in measuring poverty, and (11) the future prospects.
The overall trends indicate the increase of the poor population and income inequality, mainly due to the economic restructure, economic downturns and unemployment problems during recent years. The impacts of these trends on two-parent families and single-father families need to be further examined. People living in rural areas face higher poverty rates over the years, compared to their counterparts. However, poverty in urban areas has gradually increased in recent years. As for the feminization of poverty, there has been some evidence to support this trend. Furthermore, Poverty among the elderly, especially for females, still needs to be taken into consideration.

Collectively Sharing the Responsibility of Child Raising-The Analysis from the Conceptions of Public Goods and Externality,"Ching-Hsia Cheng, Hui-Fen Hung","child raising, children benefits, state's responsibility","Since Taiwan became old-age society in 1993, how to meet the needs of our senior citizens has already been considered as a public issue, rather than the problems of individual families. However, if the government assumes the responsibility of ”providing for the old”, but still leaves the most task of ”raising the child” to the family sector the future trend of birth rate will be affected, and then the foundation of social finance will be destabilized. Hence, the first purpose of our article is to explore whether children are public goods, something of positive externality.
The old and the child are both the parts of the dependent population, but the amounts that the government spends on the citizens over age 65 often differ from what it provides to the ones under age 20. Thus, the second purpose of our article is to analyze Taiwan's existing policies and measures respectively for the two dependent groups. Finally, we will review other country's solutions for sharing the responsibility of child raising. Accordingly, their solutions can be divided into three types: (1). The existing cash benefit system, which aims to maintain the breadwinner's income. (2). Providing benefits to the caregiver, which aims to compensate what the caregiver contributes to the task of child raising, and (3). Childcare service provision. The review and typology in our article may have some implications for Taiwan's future strategies about child raising.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200501-x-10-55-111-a,10,2005,NTU Social Work Review

A Research on the Elders' Attitudes toward Death in Long Term Care Facilities,"Chiu-Min Tsai, Hong-Jer Chang","long term care, residents in institutions, attitude toward death, long term care facilities","Long term care facilities are group residential settings for the elderly. According to the annual report published by the Ministry of the Interior in 2,000, 65.8% of the death population was over 65. It indicates that more death falls into the elder population as the medical technology improves over time. Many researches show that a person's attitudes toward death can be influenced by his/her experiences with death. What kind of attitudes would the elders hold toward their own death when living in settings where death incidences have higher occurring rate than that in other settings? In addition, what would they feel when experiencing the death of other residents in their facilities again and again? These are crucial issues which should be given attention to when providing long term care to the elderly. The research was conducted in a field site and was used qualitative analysis method to explore the processes and patterns of how those elders confronted their own death and the death of other residents in that facility.
By looking into the acceptance of death and concerns on death upon those elders, the researchers found that they were either positively accepting, afraid, indifferent or being denial when facing their own death.

However, illegal massage has seriously threatened the business of visually impaired massage workers. Since early 1990s, organizations for visually impaired persons have set up massage centers, and hired visually impaired massage workers. The purpose of this study is to explore whether these massage centers effectively tackle the occupational predicament of visually impaired massage workers, and how visually impaired workers experience and look at this new type of working environment and relationship.
This study adopts qualitative research approach in exploring the experience of ten massage centers in Taipei City. Individual In-depth interviews have been carried out with the managers and group interviews have been completed with visually impaired massage workers. An underlying purpose for interviewing visually impaired massage workers is to give them a chance to speak for themselves and to evaluate if these massage centers are empowering.
The main finding of this study is: Although massage workers feel their quality of life and dignity has improved, there are 7 models of management among these centers and they reveal varied experiences of massage workers. Simply put, those centers that perform well financially receive the least satisfaction from their massage workers. The manager being massage worker as well, the transparency of the finance, the participation of massage workers in management, and basic salary guarantee are key factors of satisfaction.

At that time, both places followed a course of indigenous development as ell as absorbing. second-hand as it were, diverse practices in social work. Now they reflect different development patterns in the practice of social work. The ”Social Work Act” of 1997 in Taiwan and the ”Social Workers Registration Ordinance” also of 1997 in Hong Kong were enacted to govern social workers in both places. Taiwan and Hong Kong have the same background of a Chinese culture and capitalist economy, yet they have different development patterns of social work practice. Thus they offer perfect material for a comparative analysis of the concepts and issues involved.
To begin with, this paper will discuss the intrinsic nature and components of social work in view of: Clarke and Newman's three settlements Payne's social construction; Greenwood's professional attributes; Wilensky's professional process; and Johnson and Yanca's four models. Secondly, it will review the development of social work and conduct a comparative analysis of the concepts and issues so involved in Taiwan and Hong Kong. By a comparative analysis of the professional development of social work in Hong Kong will find out four pushing factors:
1. The developmental resources of social welfare and social work are infected by the development of capitalist economy.
2. The role of the government in social work is in the core of position in Hong Kong.
3. The development of professional social work in Hong Kong was in process of secondary diffusion and indigenous to social work practice now.
4. The professional social work associations are formed one after another in Hong Kong. They reflect the developmental pattern and professionalization process of social work.
Thirdly, it will suggest a path for Taiwan derived from Hong Kong's social work practices. The conclusion of the article has six thoughts:
1. How to define the role of the government in social work in Taiwan.
2. How to effectively educate students in social work practices.
3. How social work associations can co-operate in perfect harmony.
4. How to provide general social work services to the community.
5. How to monitor the quality of social workers through licensing and registration.
6. How to promote professional social work and classify social workers.
Finally, this paper in view of comparative analysis discusses the political-economical-social environment, the policy and role of government in social work, the education and training in social work, the trend of social work and the challenge in the future in both places and the author hopes that this paper will have three aims:
1. To better understand and promote the policy of professional social work in Taiwan.
2. To learn from the experience of Hong Kong by having a complete understanding of particular issues or problems and the solutions adopted there. 
3. To collect more material for constructing an indigenous theory and practice in the development of professional social work in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200407-x-9-137-182-a,9,2004,NTU Social Work Review
The Establishment of Poverty Threshold and Measurement in Taiwan: The Application of FCSU Method,"Te-Mu Wang, Chao-Hsien Leu, Hua-Chin Ho","family size, poverty threshold, poverty population composition","Poverty threshold is a very practical and widely used indicator: it has been used as an indicator for the economic well-being of population groups, family, region and time period. Furthermore, it can be and has been used as the basis to evaluate economic development and to determine the effectiveness of public policy; and at the same time, it is also used as a reference to delineate the scope of needed services in policy and agenda formulation, and, therefore, provided us a clearer picture in identifying the disadvantaged groups that would need governmental intervention to meet their basic needs. The purpose of this research is, first, to review and to assess the existing literature on poverty threshold measurements. Once this first step is completed, using appropriate data, various measurements will be applied to the Taiwan situation to simulate the results of poverty rates and poverty compositions. Within the limitation of the available secondary data and the constrain of the convenience of policy promotion, FCSU method by Citro and Michael was used to calculate the budget of a family with two adults and two children. Taking into account family size and adjusting proper equivalence scale, the poverty threshold was also determined.
Using FCSU method, our simulated study shows that the percentage of the poverty population is 3.21%, and that of the poverty family is 4.49%. It was found that adjusting equivalence scale will elevate the poverty threshold of the smaller family, thus the socially disadvantaged family, especially poor elderly households, will become more obvious and pronounced. With proper equivalence scale, the poverty threshold of the larger family will be reduced, and a more precise poverty proportion of it is also shown. Thus, it is very important that the equivalence scale is adjusted in setting up the poverty threshold.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200312-x-8-1-46-a,8,2003,NTU Social Work Review

These research questions have been proposed: Why do women participate the union? What kind of roles do they play? And what kinds of factors affect their union participation and experiences?
Women’s action comes from economic cause. From their action, they recognize their own positions and roles in the union. This study pinpoints that the patriarchy of the capitalism inside the enterprise has put the female flight attendants in a very difficult position in the enterprise as well as in the union. Female members are pushed to rely on their male representatives. The uniondominated by male members narrows down the possibility of struggle. Although the basic labor conditions of female workers are under protection, female workers are trying to propose some issues of their concerns, such as maternity leave and sex harassment.

The criticisms are based on the principle of equality and the principle of realism. By way of presenting the conclusion that each of the three major components is inherently unsound and vulnerable to different defects, the author also suggests the following political implications of this research: First, with respect to the meaning component, we should loosen up the meaning of volunteering, and redefine it in the following manner: all activities, except the coerced ones, are voluntary actions so long as their social benefits exceed the costs and benefits of individual involvements. Secondly, with respect to the incentive component, we should focus on building a good infrastructure of volunteering, instead of providing with the privileged benefits in educational and military services. Thirdly, with regard to the functional component, more emphasis should be laid upon the social dimension of the contribution of volunteering, for instance, that it facilitates the accumulation of social capital and the improvement of social inclusion, than solely upon its mythical economic contribution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200212-x-7-203-241-a,7,2002,NTU Social Work Review

"The Treatment for Child Molesters-The ""Cognitive-Behavior Therapy"" and ""Coping Model"" Perspective",Yi-Shih Cheng,"Sexual offending against children, Cognitive-behavior therapy, Child molester, Sexual assault, Coping model","Sexual offenders, especially child molesters are in some ways the most difficult population for correctional intervention. According to the ”Sexual Assault Prevention Law”, passed by the Legislation Yuan, sexual offenders and child molesters must receive a probationary treatment after serving their sentence. During the probationary period, the offenders and molesters must be monitored under the reinforced treatment and follow-up programs to prevent them from committing the crime again. Therefore, it is the very moment of which social worker may intervene with professional treatments. The new law indeed provides social workers with the legitimacy of reinforced intervention for sexual offenders. This paper tries to explore the notion of ”cognitive-behavior therapy” and the ”coping model” perspective, and the application of these theoretical disciplines to treatment for child molesters. It also integrates Beckett (1994) ”comprehensive treatment model” and ”the principle of child sexual abuse treatment” that are developed by the Hennepin County Department of Community Corrections as ”the treatment model for child molesters”. In light of above models/theories, the treatment for child molester may be divided as three stages: in-take, treatment, and termination.

Gender、Dependence、Employability: Women's Economic Vulnerability and Security in Taiwan,Yea-Huey Sheu,"care responsibility, employability, dependence, two-tier welfare system, women's poverty, social assistance","The paper aims to examine women's poverty and their economic vulnerability in Taiwan, incorporating gender, dependence and employability-three relatively invisible features of much of social policy analysis-into the analysis that focuses on social assistance system. It argues that sexual discrimination in the labour market, women's care responsibilities and inadequate social provisions have been and remain crucial in determining the nature of women's economic vulnerability. The 'residual' welfare state that aims to provide social assistance or social insurance in forms of minimum benefits fails to promote women's autonomy and equality, instead of that encourages women to depend on male-breadwinners and family. It is to be noticed that a two-tier welfare system is to trap women into long-term dependence and severe poverty. Finally, it calls for attention to consider relations between women's employability and dependence, social protection and social investment, in order to assist individuals and families to cope with new social risks in the global age.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200206-x-6-123-173-a,6,2002,NTU Social Work Review
The Power Dynamics between Professions and Self-help Groups with Mentally Ill Family Members in Taiwan: The Implication for Social Work Intervention,Hon-Yei Annie Yu,"empowerment, self-help group, professional relation-ship, power dependence, the mentally ill","Disregarding the core role of ”power” in the social work professional relationship, the imbalanced power structure between the profession and their clients has been long ignored. Accordingly, the empowerment strategies to activate the client's potentials have not been well developed.
Since the needs of the mentally ill and their families have been less cared by the social work profession in Taiwan, studying the self-help groups with mentally ill family members in Taiwan will serve as a perfect opportunity to examine the power dynamics between the professions and their clientele.
How have the self-help groups with mentally ill family members in Taiwan been emerging by different forces? What roles have the professions played at different stages of self-help group development? Hasenfeld's political-economy perspective has been based to understand the development of the self-help groups with mentally ill family members in Taiwan, and the interaction between each profession and clientele was analyzed with reference to ”power dependence”. Combining both quantitative (survey questionnaire of all 21 existing self-help groups with mentally ill family members) and qualitative data (in-depth interview, participant observation, and inside documents of self-help groups), the researcher has accomplished the following goals: (1)To understand the formulation dynamics and development of these self-help groups in Taiwan, (2) To explore their operation strategies, (3) Based on the interaction between different professions and these self-help groups to generate some empowerment strategies.
It is found that the emergence of these self-help groups could be attributed to three forces: self-initiation, subordinate to the local health unit or hospital. They have very different formulation dynamics, structures and sizes. As to their operation logics and interacion with different professions, not mutually exclusive, but unigue stragtegies could be observed. Based on the above findings, feasible empowerment principles have been generated from some scholars' discourses to help the social work professionals who are committed to work with these groups.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200112-x-5-1-51-a,5,2001,NTU Social Work Review
The Implementation and Impact of Community Care in Taiwan-Perspective of Welfare Pluralism,Yuan-Shie Hwang,"welfare pluralism, privatization, community care, voluntary sector, informal sector","This paper aims to review roles of state, commercial, voluntary and informal sectors in the context of community care development by using the approach of welfare pluralism. Further, this paper also wants to look into the challenge and dilemma of community care on the way toward welfare pluralism in Taiwan. The demographic and socio-economic trends suggest that it has become more difficult to expect that family should continue functioning as main provider of caring for the elderly, therefore, caring issue has been and will be a matter of great concern for society. Under the influence of welfare pluralism, community care has become one of main strategies of coping the problem. In the context of community care provision, the four parts including state, commercial, voluntary and informal sectors are now in a period of transition. For the state sector, its role is shifting from provider of limited and fragmented services to subsidizer, regulator, monitor and provider in some fields. For commercial sector, as an element of providing care, its responsibility is to improve and guarantee service quality and accountability, and provide a stable source of foreign carers. For voluntary sector, the introduction of contracting out social services has resulted in extension of welfare service's category and scale. The problems needing to be tackled are the dilemma between traditional mission and contract requirements. In addition, whether voluntary organizations can view and take the 'accountability' as their guideline or basis in providing services is a necessary condition for carrying out the ideas of welfare plural-ism. For informal sector, provision of community care provides supporting, supplementing and strengthening family's function in caring elderly people. However, whether the idea can be carried out or not is dependent on a tug of war between the government capability and family's willingness on paying for services.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200112-x-5-53-101-a,5,2001,NTU Social Work Review

First, data regarding the current condition of service delivery was collected through secondary data analysis, focus groups, and interviews. Four working principles were formulated, including local autonomy, diversity, down-to-up planning, and partnerships between the public and private sectors. Based on these principles, researchers and practitioners worked together at three action points with many projects. The results showed that: 1. The name list of elders living alone is fairly valuable; 2. Elders living alone do not have as many needs as the public imagined; 3. There has been a partnership built between the public and the private sectors; 4. The government should support local autonomy in program development; 5. The focus of elderly service should really be community network development; and 6. There should be more cooperation among various governmental departments.

The Relationship between Family Structure and Adolescents' Social Adjustment in Taipei City,Li-Chen Cheng,"social capital, single parent, adolescent, family structure, child adjustment","For children, family life experience is significantly related to their physical, psychological, and cognitive development. However, parental obscene, as a result of divorce, death, or unwedded, has become a more common incidence happened in family than before for the past twenty years in Taiwan. Children in single parent families are reported to experience more troubles and difficulties in social adjustment process than children in two parent families. Past studies indicated that family structure change was detrimental to children development in terms of unfavorable social adjustment. But other studies pointed out that disadvantaged conditions implied in single parent families, such as low parental support, less time spent together, few social resources, and lack of peer relationship, contributed more to the poor performance in social adjustment. The study intends to examine what mechanism accounts more for the unfavorable social adjustment among children in early adolescent period. Based on cluster random sampling, a class interview using a structured questionnaire was conducted to collect related data from school children between 10 and 14 in Taipei City. Considering the biased estimation on extremely smaller sample of single parent familiar, 64 oversamples from agencies were added to the sample. As a total, 759 children were sampled for statistical analysis. Results indicated that social adjustment process was related to multiple dimensions of school children's life. And, parental abs cense had differentiated effects on children's life, depending on what dimension of adjustment referred to. Overall, the effect of parental absence only works on social aspect of children's adjustment, but not other dimensions. Children's adjustment was accounted for more by the social bonds and economic resources interweave in familial and school settings. Lastly, implications for family, school, and welfare policy are included.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200112-x-5-197-270-a,5,2001,NTU Social Work Review

Methods: Expressed-emotion scores of the caregivers were obtained using the CFMSS when the patient was admission in the hospital, and on four subsequent occasions at three, six, 12 and 24 months after admission. A total of 161 patients and their respective family caregivers were included in the study. Psychosocial variables included social support, satisfaction for medical services, feeling of stigma, mental illness attribution, cognition of illness, family burden, family adaptation, caregivers' needs, life events and quality of life. Chi-square, t-test and ANCOVA were used to examine the relationship between psychosocial variables and the caregivers' EE. Results: (1) Significantly different scores between HEE (High Expressed Emotion) and LEE (Low Expressed Emotion) caregivers were found in psychosocial variables including: social support, satisfaction for medical services, feeling of stigma, mental illness attribution, family burden, family adaptation and caregivers needs. (2) The data of two-year follow-up demonstrated that the positive aspects of psychosocial variables in HEE caregivers, for example, the social support and family adaptation scores were significantly decreased. On the other hand, the negative aspects of psychosocial variables in LEE caregivers, for example, the feeling of stigma and family burden scores were significantly decreased. (3) the result in HEE caregivers indicated paradoxical conflicting situation which limited family life adaptation and needs for social support.

The Adaptation of Returning Dropouts: Comparing the Conventional and Alternative Education Programs,"Chiu-Mei Cheng, Yu-Wen Chen","the ecological perspective, dropouts, adjustment","Helping dropouts to return to school is the ultimate goal of intervention in Taiwan; and most of them have to adjust themselves for the new school life. On the basis of the ecological perspective, this study attempts to investigate the adjustment of these students from the aspects of learning, social interaction, behavior, and self-acceptance. In addition, the study compares the conventional and alternative education programs in terms of their effectiveness in helping these returning dropouts' adaptation. Qualitative data were gathered via personal interviews with ten dropouts who had returned to schools. Among these students, two were sampled from the traditional program and eight were from four different alternative programs. Analyses of these data indicate that returning to school is just a starting point, these students still have to face various challenges coming from all aspects of life. In addition to learning problems, which actually existed before they first left school, there are other problems. However, if these students are able to cognitively accept the second chance, and can receive support from their environment, their motivation to continue the education is increased. In comparing with the traditional program, students attending the alternative education programs seem to cope better, because the latter allows more flexibility in the curriculum, as well as chances to establish better interaction with teachers and other students. The potential disadvantage of the alternative program is the labeling effect and the lack of cohesiveness. Finally, two factors are especially important to help these students adjust, one is good interaction with teachers, and the other is the student's sense of self-control.

The intervention design and development include four procedures-needs assessment, intervention design and development, the intervention implementation, and evaluation. The needs assessment was based on the social workers home visiting and also interviewed with families, who were invited to complete the self-report standardized questionnaires for the pretest including the support from their spouses, parents, parents-in-law, relatives, friends, colleagues, neighbors, and professionals. The intervention development was in accordance with three components: first, the results of needs assessment; second, integration of the literature review such as family-centered and home-based services, strategies working with involuntary clients, family preservation services, and task-centered approaches; and third, the practitioner's practical experiences. Five social workers, working in the Early Intervention Center of Taipei City, were charged with carrying out the intervention, eight sessions in four weeks.

The Third Sector and the Construction of Civil Society: An Essay Focusing on Relations among Sectors,Yu-Yuan Kuan,"Associational Life, Civil Society, the Third Sector, Nonprofit/Nongovernmental Organizations, the Blurring of the Sectors","The pursuit of the preferred setting, the most supportive environment, and sorts of institutions for the good life is the ever goal that human being make great efforts try to achieve. To provide answers to make this dream come true, human being have tried various approaches and institutions since the beginning of history. The first part of this paper present a detailed discussion of the ”concept of civil Society” elaborated originally by Michael Walzer (1995). Walzer emphasized that there are four rival ideologies, including political community, Marx's cooperative economy, the Capitalist definition of the marketplace, and the nationalist stand by ties of blood and history. Each has its own claim to completeness and correctness. However, each neglects the necessary pluralism of any civil society. Walzer offered a fifth answer, holding that the good life can only be lived in civil society in which people freely associate and communicate with one another, form and reform groups of all sorts, not for the sake of any particular formation but for the sake of sociability itself. Walzer pointed out that the quality of our political and economic activity and of our national culture is intimately connected to the strength and vitality of our associations. Extending the meaning of the Walzer's concept of civil society, the second part of this paper discusses the characteristics of the third sector and the relations between the third sector and other sectors. The author of this paper emphasizes that it is inappropriate for academics and practitioners at present to use the term of ”nonprofit” or ”nongovernmental” consistently in describing the kind of organizations of the third sector. The conventional usage of the term described above is easy to push itself into dire straits because of the view that a clear boundary among sectors is necessary. Furthermore, this proposition tends to ignore the resilience of interaction among NPOs/NGOs, state, market, and community, and will produce negative impacts on the construction of civil society. Finally, reflections on the relations among the third sector, the public sector, and the private for-profit sector are presented.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200106-201306190017-201306190017-163%2b165-201,4,2001,NTU Social Work Review

It starts with the description of each sector's social functions, and their interaction patterns, then followed by the analyses of the social meaning of charitable giving, and the relationship of NPO mission accomplishment and charitable giving by the public at large. The emphases were put on the discussion of why NPO need to build its public accountability, and the cyclic relation of the coercive mechanism (regulation/law), together with the normative mechanism (self-regulation) bring about the mimetic effect of other organization among NPO.

They were more dynamic and informational.Content analysis revealed six negative impacts that emerged from narratives-worsen health, confinement, no-substitutive person, interrupted career plan, diminished social activities, and suffering of emotions from care recipients. Not all impacts are negative. This study also found positive impacts such as learning new caring skills, experiencing meaning of life, feeling the caring love between each other, feeling achieving, and teaching filial duty to offspring. In terms of coping with caring stress, two strategies were identified. They were emotion-focused and problem-focused strategies. Most of the time, these two strategies were used inter­changeably.Gender differences were not significant in impacts and coping strategies, except that daughters were more likely to look for spiritual consolation and more actively to look for social support and social resources.

The results indicate that, with everything else held constant, families with higher income allocate a greater share of their resources to normal goods than do low-income families. With family income held constant, single-parent families allocate more of their expenditure to medical services and inferior goods, and allocate much less of their resources to normal goods. This expenditure behavior suggests that single-parent families have an economically disadvantaged status compared to two-parent families. On the other hand, these single-parent families have different preferences as well. Single-father families allocate more of their resources to adult goods such as drinking and tobacco while single-mother families devote more resources to family- and/or child-oriented goods such as education.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200012-201306190016-201306190016-37%2b39-68,3,2000,NTU Social Work Review

A Multinomial Logit model is used to analyze whether families' socio-demographic factors are important to families' childcare choices, as well as whether policies that improve the quality of child care or reduce its costs for parents would affect families' childcare choices. The results indicate that families' childcare choices are varied by family's need for care, mother's tastes and preferences, the availability of informal care, and the cost of center care. However, the effect of the number of children per child care worker (presumably the quality of care) does not have a significant effect on families' decisions about care arrangements, although the effects are in the expected direction. The contribution of this paper is that this is the first work to jointly examine the socio-demographic factors (representing the resources inside the family) and the contextual factors (representing the resources outside the family) on families' childcare choices for their pre-school age children in the hope that by understanding the important determinants of families' decisions, a sound child care or family policy can be formulated to meet the different needs of families with young children in search of the accessible and high quality of child care for their pre-school age children.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200012-201306190016-201306190016-69%2b71-110,3,2000,NTU Social Work Review

The Political Logic of Privatizing Taiwan's National Health Insurance,Kuo-Ming Lin,"Politics and Social Policy, National Health Insurance, Privatization, Financing and Cost Containment of Health Insurance","Taiwan's government is trying to privatize the state-managed, single-payer system of national health insurance, with the view of turning it into a privately-managed, pluralistic structure of administration. This paper analyzes the origins, nature and possible consequences of the government's privatization proposal. It is argued that, despite the policy rhetoric of improving efficiency, enhancing societal participation and increasing options of choice, the major motive of the government's privatization policy is to de-politicize the decision-making process of the national health insurance in order to achieve fiscal balance. I further argue that this ”political logic” of privatization has been originated from the government's lack of administrative and political capacities to control the medical costs and manage the conflicts involving in the readjustment of costs. Presenting a long-term historical view in this paper, I examine how the government's capacities have been constrained by the institutional features of health insurance systems and the polity.
I also evaluate the possible outcomes of the privatization policy, and point out that the privatization policy will increase system costs, reduce social benefits, and undermine solidarity and social equality. With these possible outcomes in minds, I conclude that policy reform in Taiwan's national health insurance should strength governmental capacities and democratic participation, instead of privatizing the state-managed, single-payer system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200005-x-2-55-96-a,2,2000,NTU Social Work Review

Single-Parent Families and the Poverty: The Case of 1998 in Taiwan,Chernt-Tay James Hsueh,"Poverty Line, Single-parent Household, Adult-equivalence Scale, Relative Poverty, Absolute Poverty","There are several research purposes in this paper: 1) to estimate the most recent amount of single-parent households in Taiwan under a strict definition that only parents of divorced, separated, widowed or out-of-wedlock birth living with children are under considerations; 2) to investigate the poverty of single-parent families using three different measures derived from the official poverty line, the unweighted relative poverty and the relative poverty weighted by adult-equivalence scale, separately; 3) to compare poverty rates among different household patterns as well as among detail single-parent household types; 4) to estimate the effects on poverty using variables including gender, schooling and job status of household heads, as well as the number of dependent children and aged persons in the households; 5) to analyze the differential effects on poverty within single-parent families of both sexes.
This paper concludes that the poverty rate of single-parent households is considerably higher than that of other household patterns, regardless of poverty measurements being used. There is no sign of economic worsen for female than male of lone-parent- household heads in Taiwan in 1998. Households headed by female widowers and by divorced males have experienced highest rates of poverty among all types of single-parent households. Finally, the results from multivariate analyses indicate that schooling and dependent family members are crucial factors in explaining to be poor for single-parent households.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200005-x-2-151-189-a,2,2000,NTU Social Work Review
An Exploration on the Youth Residential Service,Renn Chang,"mandated services, youth residential service, involuntary services for youth, community-based interventions, out-of-home placement","This paper explores some issues related to residential services for adolescents. As the passage of several child and youth welfare legislation in the past decade, out-of-home placement has been designed as one of the service provisions for the youth. Since residential services has been proposed as the major mean for out-of-home placement, several issues about residential care arise: Is residential care best seen as a substitute for a family that has failed, or as a support for a family in crisis? Further, what a residential care would be like while it has been practiced as a mandated service? How the youth and professional workers perceive it as the helping process instead of as the punitive measures? To examine these issues, this paper first analyzes the characteristics of residential care services that have been mandated by three major Youth Acts in Taiwan. Next, the assumptions underlying in residential care are explored, in particular, with regard to the practical and ethical problems in practice. Finally, recommendations are provided to develop social work interventions for the troubled youth.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200005-x-2-191-215-a,2,2000,NTU Social Work Review
"Socioeconomic Trends in Single-Parent Families in Taiwan, 1980-1995",Chien-Chung Huang,"Single-parent Family, Economic Security","Using Family Income and Expenditures Survey from 1980 to 1995 waves, the proportion of single-parent families and their socioeconomic characteristics are examined. The finding shows that the number of single-parent families significantly increased during this period. In 1980-83 about one out of every 25 families with children was headed by a parent who had never married or who was divorced, separated, or widowed. But the number had risen to one out of every 18 families between 1992 and 1995. This increase was accompanied by substantial changes in the socioeconomic characteristics of the families. The number of divorced parents significantly increased; they were younger and more educated than traditional single parents were, who in the earlier period had tended to be widowed. Measures of economic well-being, such as the size-adjusted income and expenditures, the Engel index, and the poverty rates, all indicate the inferior status of single-parent families in society. In particular, families headed by widowed and separated mothers were the worst off.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-200005-x-2-217-248-a,2,2000,NTU Social Work Review
The Relationship between Violent Environment and Adolescent Violent Behaviors,Yu-Wen Chen,"family violence, adolescent violent behaviors, campus violence, violence in the mass media","As crimes committed by adolescents are more and more violent these days, the public generally perceived them as those who deserve punishment instead of help. This is especially true in Taiwan where most studies examining adolescent violence were done from the criminological perspective, while related research done by the social work professional is relatively few. However, it is found that many violent adolescents are consistently exposed to violent environments, including violence in families, schools, and the mass media, though we usually do not pay much attention to the environmental factors, while allow these adolescents to be the scapegoats of adults' fault. Moving beyond a crime-focused perspective, this study is designed to base on the social learning theory and related literature. It attempts to provide a better understanding of environmental factors associated with youth violence in Taiwan.
In this research, data were collected by means of questionnaires administered in a group setting. The original sample is comprised of 1,277 youths from the juvenile justice system in Taiwan, after deleting those who were not eligible in age and did not provide complete information, it ended up with the effective sample size of 747. The multiple regression was used to test hypotheses. Findings of this research indicate that violent environment plays a very important role in influencing adolescents' violent behaviors, while witnessing campus violence among students is a relatively important factor associated with youth violence. The results of this study can offer a different perspective toward youth violence, and furthermore, to provide guidelines for the development of interventions that work for our youth. Implications for future research are also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-199905-x-1-1-33-a,1,1999,NTU Social Work Review
An Evaluation on the Proposed Plans for the National Health Insurance Reform-A Study Based on a Delphi Survey,"Hsin-Hua Chen, Michael S. Chen",national health insurance,"The Executive Yuan has submitted a proposal calling for a number of fundamental changes in the NHI, such as a NHI foundation, and more importantly, a system with plural insurers (or, more accurately, carriers). To evaluate those proposals, this study applies the Delphi method, surveying on health-policy scholars and specialists for a series of issues, including changes in the benefit package, payment scheme, cost sharing, and assessments for plans in the entirely. We found that a majority of the surveyed seemed to come to a consensus that the current benefit package must be reduced, and the Chinese medicine was oh the top of the list to be cut. They also supported the idea if introducing institutions akin to HMOs, implementing a global budget which had been legislated, introducing DRGs for hospital services, A Capitation system was also supported, and so were medical savings accounts (MSAs), though by a slightly smaller majority. As for the proposals in their entirety, the surveyed considered a piecemeal reform plan based on the current system would face resistance; provider groups (a preferred name for HMOs here in Taiwan) based on hospitals would be more powerful in containing costs than that based on clinics; accessibility and quality, however, might be compromised. A plural model might enhance efficiency, accessibility, though, become a concern because of cream skimming practiced by the carriers.

Assets Accumlation and Intergenerational Transmission among Female Headed Families,Li-Chen Cheng,"poverty, intergenerational transmission, assets accumulation, female headed family","The growth of female headed families is the most significant demographic trend for the past few decades. Such families now constitute 6.5 percent of all families with children in Taiwan. However, what generates concern among policy makers and family researchers is its strong link to ”the feminization of poverty.” There are negative economic consequence of living in female-headed families, both the short and the long-term. Current antipoverty strategies heavily focus on the development of human capital. While human capital is important, there is growing empirical evidence that assets play a central role in reducing vulnerability to poverty. This paper presents key findings of the study on assets accumulation as well as transmission across generations among female headed families.
Fifty female heads, sampled from five different populated areas across country, were interviewed in an in-depth way. Thirty-eight of them are from low income families, but the other 12 are not. Two findings are indicated in the study. First, there is a strong similarity in educational attainment between female heads and their parents. However, few female heads with low educational level are able to get away from poverty based on the accumulation of tangible assets from the previous marriage. Second, female heads in the study reported that they received social support from kinship network, but not tangible assets transmission.
A focus on enhancing the educational attainment, and thereby the income generating capacity, of women who are single parents should balance with strategies to facilitate asset accumulation among the group of women. Implications for social welfare policy and social work practice are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-199905-x-1-111-147-a,1,1999,NTU Social Work Review
Modulation of the Child Protection Movement in Taiwan,Hon-Yei Annie Yu,"child protection, clients rights, medical discourse, professional autonomy, myth of motherhood","This paper attempts to explore the essence of child protection in Taiwan in the last ten years, in contrast to the transitions of child protection movement in the United States in its historical context. In the United States, ”the personal moral discourse” worked against the low SES families in the 19th century, while ”the medical discourse” attacted the whole range of SES families in the mid-twentieth century. The child protection system in Taiwan seemed to be affecked by both discourse.
The author attempts to uncover some of the issues regarding the child protection phenomenum in Taiwan, such as (1) private agencies taking initiatives before governmental responses or intervention, (2) limited professional autonomy in the governmental bureaucracy, (3) conflict of interest between profession and clientele, (4) possible impact of the myth about motherhood and family on the decision-making of a CPS worker. The above speculations are supported by the empirical data collected in Taiwan by this author in the last two years.

The Decision-Making Process of Day Care Service Utilization by Older People: Whose Needs? Whose Decision?,Pau-Ching Lu,"Autonomous Decision-Making by Older People, Service Utilization, Day Care Services, the Relationship between Informal Care and Formal Care for Older People","The purpose of this paper is to examine the decision-making process of day care service utilization by older people. The focus is to explore the role that family members play in the decision-making process, and to examine the autonomy that older people have in decision-making. The in-depth interview technique was used to collect data.
The conclusions can be drawn from the findings. First of all, family members act as information source for older people. In addition, they not only perceived the needs of older people, but also created the sense of needs felt by older people. In some cases, the respite care needs felt by family members drove older people to use service. Secondly, family members may encourage older people to use service by accompanying them to visit day care centers. Furthermore, family members' attitude towards service utilization and the meaning of services use perceived by older people may become the barriers to service use. Thirdly, the finding shows that some older people had ”direct autonomy” in decision-making, while others complied with family members' decisions.

Social Work Practice Elements and Intervention Strategies of Empowerment Perspective,Shan-Ru Chao,"sense of helplessness, consciousness raising, intervention strategy, partnership","This article is mainly aimed at discussing the meanings of empowerment perspective, and explaining the elements of social practice and the strategies of intervention developed and applied by professionals of social work while adopting this perspective. Empowerment is a process of decreasing and improving the sense and situations of helplessness of clients and helping them develop and increase power, so that they have enough power to enhance the degree of controlling their life and fate. The process of developing and increasing power must include three levels: personal; interpersonal; and political/communal. When practitioners adopt this perspective, they have to especially consider the following nine elements: value base, sanctions for intervention, theory base, worker-client relationship, definition and assessment of problem, goal setting, role taking, intervention strategies and techniques, and evaluation. Of those, special stress is put on worker-client relationship to be partnership which requires collaboration, trust and sharing as well as interaction conducted by dialogue and critical analysis. Furthermore, viewing the definition and assessment of problem is a process of clients' conciousness-raising. Based on the purposes, intervention strategies applied in empowering perseptive can be divided into four dimentions: dimention 1-helping clients look for resources and secure needed assistance; dimention 2-providing clients with the knowledge and skills necessary for solving problems; dimention 3-entering the goal of change or mediation, which is mainly to help clients learn about social service and health care resources and how to access them; dimention 4-involving clients in the political aspects of their problems with social action enabling clients to solve their problems. The interrelationship of the four dimentions is not mutually exclusive, linear nor sequential; that is, intervention may begin in any dimention.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=16818822-199905-x-1-231-262-a,1,1999,NTU Social Work Review

The Challenges and Model of Integrating Marital Violence and Child Abuse Services,April Chiung-Tao Shen,"family violence, marital violence, child abuse, integrated service","Both Western and domestic empirical studies provide overwhelming evidence that marital violence and child abuse often co-occur in the same families. Moreover, the experiences of dual-violence have negative and long-term impact on children. However, marital violence and child abuse were often intervened by separate systems and practitioners that might result in uncoordinated services, and therefore, was not able to protect all the victims of family violence. In order to prevent the fragment services, this study aims to examine the challenges and possible model of integrating marital violence and child abuse services. Examining the issue of integrated services can avoid the lack of coordination and conflict between the marital violence and child abuse service sectors, and help preventing family violence based on the consideration of enhancing the safety of all family members. This study used multiple data collection methods, including focus group and questionnaire. Five focus groups were held around the nation (including northern, central, and southern Taiwan) with the participation of 24 social work supervisors or directors. Quantitative data was collected from a sample of 39 social work practitioners in public or private agencies by using a questionnaire designed from the focus group qualitative data. The questionnaire completion rate is 88.6%. Research results show that there is no consistent model across the nation and there is a lack of standardized procedure for serving dual-violence families. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. Research participants suggest that the ideal integrated model should assign cases by families, rather than individuals. Moreover, it is better for the dual-violence family to have a case manager or social worker with authorized official power to be in charge of coordinating services. Developing a standardized operation process or handbook, and enhancing the batterer’s treatment programs are also suggested. Finally, it is suggested that a complete service package should include not only individual services for the husband, the wife, and their children, but also treatment for the whole family as well. The service goal is to increase the safety and well-being of the whole family.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/124EC2o0EjVjMVRnAPLqYfXx5niKvTmPC/view,12.1,2008,Social Policy & Social Work
A Study of Flexicurity Strategy in Netherlands and Denmark: The Institutionalist Life-course Policy Approach,Chih-lung Huang,"flexicurity, decommodification, Netherlands, Denmark, lifecourse policy","The flexicurity strategy in Netherlands and Denmark, i.e. flexible labour market and the reinforcement of social security institutions, successfully kept the unemployment rate from rising in the 1990s and has drawn attention from social policy scholars. Under the development of flexible labour market and destabilized employment pattern, the agenda of flexicurity strategy has been shifted to strengthen and facilitate the transitions in social security institutions. Drawing on institutional analysis on redistribution of time and income, this paper explores outcomes and development from recent flexicurity reforms. Results show that the working time in Netherlands and Denmark has been redistributed both vertically and horizontally. Nevertheless, Netherlands is close to the postproductivist mode, while Denmark remains in the productivist framework. In light of the new life course policy guided by the idea of post-work society, these remain problems unsettled by Netherlandish and Danish flexicurity strategies.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/124EC2o0EjVjMVRnAPLqYfXx5niKvTmPC/view,12.1,2008,Social Policy & Social Work

Among 545 respondents with completed data, 50.0% participants had engaged in self-mutilation after placement. Among them, 33.9% said they “seldom” did it, 29.8% said they “sometimes” did it, and 11.2% said they “often” did it. In terms of reasons, most reported they did so to reduce aversive emotions or thoughts, such as anger, stress, pain, loneliness, and unpleasant memories. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analyses revealed that frequency of self-mutilation after placement could be predicted by gender, depressive symptoms, attitudes toward institutional regulations, and association with self-mutilating peers. Acceptance of self-mutilation played a weak mediating effect between association with self-mutilation peers and the frequency of self-mutilation. The study suggests that all residents should be screened for their emotional state and risk of self-mutilation.

However, little is known regarding how the social work discipline prepares its students to work with people living with HIV/AIDS. One important method for training future social workers is college-level textbooks, because they are often the basic materials for students to learn social work value, knowledge, and skills. Therefore, presentation of adequate and accurate HIV/AIDS information in these texts is important. The present study involves a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 108 social work textbooks used in Taiwan and published between 1985 (when the first HIV case appeared in Taiwan) and 2005. The result reveals that among the 108 textbooks, 39 of them mentioned HIV/AIDS issues. The newer, translated, or professional foundation subject textbooks presented more HIV/AIDS information. However, many books that included HIV/AIDS information did not present a comprehensive overview of this issue, and did not adequately address the role social workers should play in practice. The most popular form in which social work textbooks presented HIV/AIDS issues was a simple mention, and no more than a simple mention. Furthermore, invisibility, stereotyping, unreality, and fragmentation are four identified problems regarding the presentation of HIV/AIDS issues in the 108 social work textbooks.

Based on the data constructed by linking Manpower Utilization Surveys and the administrative records of National Health Insurance, the research utilizes discrete choice theory to construct the uninsured model, with crucial individual characteristics and socioeconomic status and aggregate socioeconomic ecological variables being controlled. Main findings are as follows: (1) for the labor force, the uninsured rate for the unemployed is four times as much high as that associated with the employed, while the disabled and elderly have the highest uninsured rate for those not in the labor force, (2) marginal laborers, including underutilized workers, those experienced involuntary turnover, miners, construction workers, production workers, and low-skilled laborers, are more prone to be uninsured than the ordinary people, (3) aggregate socioeconomic conditions like economic growth, employment growth, unemployment rate, and medical subsidy are crucial in accounting for the uninsured problem. Research findings suggest that marginal labor and the young are associated with substantially high uninsured likelihood that has long been much ignored by past policy.

Paradigm Continuity or Paradigm Shift? Study of Pension Reforms in the UK and Germany,"Chung-Yang Yeh, Shih-Jiunn Shi","United Kingdom, Germany, pension reform, path dependency, paradigm shift","With population ageing, the issue of reforming pension systems stands on top of the political agenda worldwide. Numerous academic discussions on the retrenchment of the welfare state have pointed out that institutional factors such as the maturity of pension systems, double payment burden, as well as interest groups, have constrained the extent and scope of welfare reforms, manifesting the staunching effect of path dependency. Yet, our research reveals the possibility of institutional change or even paradigm shift despite the different modes of pension reform worldwide. We choose the prime examples of Beveridge and Bismarck pension systems ė United Kingdom and Germany as the cases for comparison, and analyze their pension reforms in the late 1990s and the 2000s from the perspective of institutional change. In the case of British pension reform, the state centered on the issues of resolving elderly poverty and the synergy of public and private sectors, thereby transforming the SERPS into the S2P (State Second Pension) with the aim of providing additional income support for those unable to claim the SPS (Stakeholder Pension Scheme). The German pension reform focused instead on the reduction of non-wage labor cost by encouraging voluntary supplementary pensions in compensation for the declining income replace rate of the statutory pensions, as well as by introducing means-tested basic pensions. As pension reforms of both countries are gearing toward the multi-pillar model of the World Bank, we argue that the British pension reform manifests paradigm continuity, whereas the German case demonstrates incremental paradigm shift.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mbgZfiffYMAbYiYVo4XbOBDQaI2IY9LD/view,13.1,2009,Social Policy & Social Work

Issues and Options in Vocational Qualifications and Training Requirements for Home Care Workers in Taiwan: Lessons Learned from Britain and Japan,"Pau-Ching Lu, Chen-Fen Chen","care workers, home care, vocational qualification, on-the-job training","‘Ageing in place’ has been set up as the goal for long-term care policy in developed countries. As a result, it creates a great demand for home care services and therefore the shortage of care worker workforce becomes deteriorated. Hence, the issue on employment and training for care workers caught attentions from researchers and policy makers in the field of gerontological social services recently. This study precedes the analyses focusing on the issue in employment from human resource management. First, we compare the experiences regarding vocational qualification, training requirements and salary of care workers in Britain and Japan, and we found that these two countries both implemented vocational qualification requirements for care workers and also build up career ladder for workers’ promotions, the difference between these two countries was in the training system: the measure to combine vocational qualifications and on-the-job training was employed in Britain, whereas there are many measures to train licensed care workers in Japan. Second, we present the results generated from the analyses of survey dataset, containing the responses form 569 home care workers and 179 direct supervisors for home care workers in Taiwan.

At the Intersection of Gender and Ethnic: Analyzing Immigrant Wives’ Social Capital,Yea-huey Sheu,"female immigrant, social capital, social networks, trust, gendered power","Social capital, as the connection among individuals, especially in terms of social network, trust and reciprocity, has been identified to be an important resource for immigrants to access resources, develop a sense of belonging and take advantage of early experience and information. This study aims to explore social capital among women who migrates from South-East Asian, mainly Vietnam and Indonesia, through the pathway of international marriage with Taiwanese men. To what extent of trust, reciprocity and social support that women gain from coethnics, coworkers, neighbors and family–in-law are examined particularly. The results show that immigrant wives have calculatedly avoided to contact and spend time with coethnic counterparts in order to earn ‘trust’ from family–in-law to secure their marriage. Consequently, immigrant women develop reciprocal relationship with coethnics at a minimal level and solely depend on their husband to provide support, such as finance, housework and child care. Those who receive more information from neighbors, coworkers, and coethnics seem to have more positive, confident attitudes about future lives. This paper concludes that ‘trust’ is the gateway to social capital for immigrant wives and social capital is not only context-tied but also gendered.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AAcNkEaFaAIN_CJEgAcoDI9jEozvPR4b/view,13.2,2009,Social Policy & Social Work
The Overlooked Historical Facts: An Examination of the Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 649 in Light of Changes in Work by the Visually Impaired in Taiwan,Tasing Chiu,"vision-impairment, Judicial Yuan Interpretation, work, employment","On October 31, 2008, the Taiwan Justices of the Constitutional Court issued Judicial Yuan (J.Y.) Interpretation No. 649, which proclaimed that it ‘is unconstitutional for the Physically and Mentally Disabled Citizens Protection Act to restrict massage work to vision-impaired individuals. Such provision shall be invalid no later than three years subsequent to the issuance of this Interpretation’. Their reasoning was that, as the knowledge and capability of many vision-impaired people gradually increases, their choice of occupation will also increase, and, thus, the statutory provision in question tends to make the governing authority overlook the fact that the talents of vision-impaired are not limited to the massage business alone. Nearly thirty years after the Act’s promulgation, according to the J.Y. interpretation, the social-economic condition of the vision-impaired has not seen any significant improvement. There is no substantial nexus between the objectives and the means, therefore, the provision contradicts the meaning and intent of Article 7 of the Constitution on the right of equal protection. However, these statements by the J.Y. were based on erroneous assumptions that contradict the historical facts. This study will show that restriction of massage business to the vision-impaired, or the cancel of it, came about not in order to protect the welfare and labor rights of the vision-impaired in Taiwan, but, rather, as discriminatory judicial means of systematic exclusion and exploitation.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AAcNkEaFaAIN_CJEgAcoDI9jEozvPR4b/view,13.2,2009,Social Policy & Social Work

"Influential Analysis of the Local Politician in Community Work: A Case of Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County",Leang-yang Lai,"local politician, community work, election, faction","Community is one of social work service fields and also a political field. For social workers, whether the welfare service can impel in the community, they are related closely to local politician. The influence of community’s politician, ranging from central government to local area, includes president, legislator, county magistrate, county councilor, township mayor, township representative and the village chief. The President is unable to serve the electoral district because of his nationwide status. Other local politician has to serve their voters for supports and therefore excise their different influences to the community. This research chooses the Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County as a case study, especially with the four communities participating in ‘the Flagship Community Navigation Plan’, interviewing their directors and the general managers by depth interview and focus group, exploring the possible influences of local politician in community work. There are many findings. First, elections have deeply influenced the allocation of community resources, the closer the election, the more obvious effect is. Second, the influence of community’s politician, the more close to the grassroots level, the bigger affect is. Legislator and county magistrate’s influence is more indirect, the county councilor, township mayor, township representative and the village chief affect the community more important. Third, township mayor and village chief are based on the election consideration which would favor the allocation of resources with ‘equitable distribution’ principle. Fourth, township representative chairman has a great power of review in the community funds. Fifth, since the community development association director and the village chief is usually the same person, it can not create checks, balances and competition, especially as different people may have a conflict, even though it can also have a positive function.

Inequality in Health Care Finance in Taiwan: 1995-2006,"Jen-Huoy Tsay, Feng-Yu Kao","national health insurance, social insurance contributions, outof-pocket, health care expenditure, inequality","Previous studies have indicated that both of the distributional regressivity of Taiwan’s national health insurance (NHI) premium contributions and out-of-pocket medical expenses were decelerating annually between 1995 and 2000. After 2000, the NHI financing strategies as well as the income distribution in Taiwan have come across great changes and that may influence the distributional effects of health care financial structure as a whole. Therefore, by applying the 1995-2006 Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, this study compares the inequality of health care finance between two periods: 1995-2000 and 2001-2006. The results show that during 2001-2006, the growth of total medical expenditures was more rapidly than previous stage while its distributional regressivity was decreased. Specifically, the percentage of NHI premium contributions to total medical expenditures has been decreased while its distributional effect has progressed. The percentage of out-of-pocket to total medical expenditures was at the same range while its regressivity has deteriorated. As for the purchase of commercial health insurance, it has grown dramatically for the middle-lower income groups as well as those with middle-higher income. Therefore, its share of total medical expenditures has increased while the progressivity has decreased. The results suggest that although it is policy favorable to see the ongoing progressivity of NHI premium contributions, the growth of private sector medical expenditures and their regressivity to income distribution will harm the middle-lower income households.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1aEarqgDDqGSUNd4sBhxiS91B5IcWtz/view,14.1,2010,Social Policy & Social Work

This paper argues that since World War II, owing to the acceptance of state responsibility for providing universal welfare, social work has become a statutory occupation and a part of the state. After it, collective social provision became principal ideology. State social workers started to engaged in the social services departments providing ‘direct service and care’ for the needy. In late 1970s, when Conservatives came to power, they stressed shrinking state provision and the mixed-economy of welfare gained influence. While community care delegated more power to the voluntary and private sector which became the mainstream service provision for adults. Care management inevitably became the new favorite and restructured social work practice. Then, in 2000s, New Labour represented a new political landscape – more tightly framed by the neo-liberalism rationality and new managerialism on the one hand and by the greater statutory and legal controls on the other. The emphasis on accountability, standards and performance indicators, collaboration and partnership became high priority and the main concern in social work practice, social work education and training. In sum, the social work in England has not exhibit the real autonomy yet, it was dominated by the state profoundly. The state welfare governance not only sets out the duties and responsibilities of social workers, but defines the practice implementation of the state social work.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1aEarqgDDqGSUNd4sBhxiS91B5IcWtz/view,14.1,2010,Social Policy & Social Work

The violent behavior of the offenders is deemed originated from psycho-physiological disorder or patriarchal attitude, and so the offenders need assistance and education from the professionals to correct their perception and violent behavior. This study focused on the offenders’subjective experience and, in the context of interpretive interactionism, analysed six cases of male offenders who already completed offender’s treatment programs. There were three major results: 1. the domestic violence prevention mechanism’s approach was over simplified. It marginalized the offenders’ experience, and the offenders’ own wishes and needs were neglected, such as wishing to remove the label of ‘villain’, or the feeling that they were also victims and needed help. 2. The offenders made effort in the hope of maintaining their family, however they felt that the assistance imposed by the domestic violence prevention mechanism was not only unhelpful, but destructive to the preservation of the family. 3. The offenders fell victim under the two-fold pressure from traditional patriarchal value and the labor market. In particular, when the middle-lower class male offenders suffered from the suppress from the labor market, it became immensely difficult for them to find a standpoint between the traditional and the modern role. This study proposes that the professionals who work in the offender’s treatment programs shall reflect upon their framework of correction and assistance developed by the domestic violence prevention mechanism.

However, the roles performed by these individuals as well as the negative impacts of these roles on them have not been well recognized. The situation of young carers in Taiwan is also poorly understood. In this preliminary study, the qualitative method and in-depth interviews are adopted to examine the everyday experiences and practices of children and young people involved in family care provision in Taiwan. By providing a deeper investigation of the lives of young carers, this research enhances the understanding of the nature of young caring. The empirical findings reveal that young carers carry out a variety of tasks in and around the home, ranging from intimate and personal care responsibilities to domestic chores and financial support. Many of these tasks distinguish the young carers from other children and young people who do not take on caring roles within the family. The research particularly identifies the ways in which the caring roles affect the lives and development of the young carers. The burden of caring can severely impede the educational performance of the children and young people. It also has an adverse effect on the young carers’ physical and mental wellbeing. In addition, the young carers experience difficulties in establishing friendships. To respond to the impacts of care activities on children and young people, this research concludes by proposing recommendations for further enhancing current services in order to support young carers.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTzrPc5_MbMlHlbrVeuK1UpnRxmSXYWl/view,15.2,2011,Social Policy & Social Work
A Critical Look at Record-Keeping in Social Work,Shu-Yuan Wang,"Taiwan social work, social work record, accountability, risk management","Questionnaires from 121 social workers in Taiwan revealed 88%were stressed by their job’s record-keeping requirements and 61% spent more time keeping records of the services they delivered than actually delivering those services. They spent an average of 46% of total hours worked keeping records. Though social workers are not paid by those they serve and instead need to account for themselves to those who do fund their work and evaluate their performance – still, the exaggerated recordkeeping requirements most social workers are saddled with today cannot help but contribute to burn-out and the shortage of human resources in the profession. As necessary a part of their job as it is, record-keeping should not be allowed to become an obstacle to the effective performance of the social workers’ main duties. The author suggests that simplifying recordkeeping requirements in the profession would equally well serve risk management and accountability needs.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YTzrPc5_MbMlHlbrVeuK1UpnRxmSXYWl/view,15.2,2011,Social Policy & Social Work

Based on reviewing literature, exited danger assessment instruments, and archival information of 80 femicide and attempted femicide cases, and discussing with practioners and scholars, this study constructed a pool of potential predictors, and formed a questionnaire. The samples (N=773) are intimate partner victims who asked for help from 51 police precincts and hospitals in 22 cities and counties. As a result of empirical analyses, a 15 items scale was constructed and named Taiwan Intimate Partner Violence Danger Assessment (TIPVDA). The TIPVDA score above 8 is the index of high risk category.

Beyond Symbolic Representation: Women’s Political and Economic Influences on Women’s Rights and Benefits in the United States,Lee-Joy Cheng,"descriptive representation, substantive representation, women’s rights and benefits, gender equality, LISREL","Among affluent industrialized nations, the United States provides the fewest rights and benefits for women. While previous literature focused on examining gender ratios in every aspect of the labor market and exploring the relationship between the ratio of female representation and benefits, this study chooses an active representation approach that goes beyond describing gender equality. In this study, LISREL model statistical analysis is employed to examine the structural relationship between women’s political and economic power, policy performance and social security in the United States. Concretely, the major findings are: (1) women’s economic power promotes better welfare policy performance for women and enhances the political power of women, while exerting an indirect positive effect on their social security, (2) though the degree of political power of women has a direct, but moderate, positive effect on their social security, better effects may be obtained through more effective performance of welfare policies.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qy0L7UnyvuIVkQH0auRpoFWai6Y1YETK/view,16.1,2012,Social Policy & Social Work
Rereading Jane Addams’s Theory of Community Work,"Ying-Chen Chang, Yi-Shih Cheng","Jane Addams, community work, social reform","Community has reemerged as a main policy framework in many areas of public services since 1990s. Community work was one of the most important practice methods in the social work profession. However, community work is becoming marginalized in social work practice now. Contemporary community-based public services are strongly influenced by the Neo-liberalism. Neoliberals focus more on the service provision in the community rather than community participation. The current Neoliberal community practice contradicted Jane Addams’s ideas of community work. We reinterpret Jane Addams’s theory of community from the autobiography and from biographies and publications on her or on settlement house movement. We explore Jane Addams’s philosophy of pragmatism and how her philosophy was practiced at Hull-House. According to Jane Addams, community is not only a place for welfare provision, but also a field for social inclusion. The residents of community are not clients of welfare, but are citizens of participating in public affairs. Community is a public sphere that promotes social reform and socializes democracy. We believe that Jane Addams’s ideas of community work are heuristic for social democracy, neighborhood identity, social reform, and community-university partnership for Taiwan.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qy0L7UnyvuIVkQH0auRpoFWai6Y1YETK/view,16.1,2012,Social Policy & Social Work
A Preliminary Exploration of Cultural Competence in Indigenous Social Work: A Case Study of Hualien County,Hiu-Ha Chong,"cultural competence, indigenous social work, qualitative research method","Cultural competence is vital to effective Indigenous social work practice, affecting service quality and the realization of social justice. A review of literature suggested that there is little knowledge of cultural competence in Indigenous social work in Taiwan, and there is a lack of consistent view on its definition and intellectual construct. By using a qualitative research method, 21 service providers and 8 Indigenous service users were interviewed in Hualien county to explore their understanding of cultural competence in Indigenous social work. The research reveals that six interrelated dimensions, including language, relationship, attitudes and values, knowledge, skills and cultural safety are important components of the framework. The further analysis suggests that cultural competence is not only a process of achieving effective practice, but also a process of recognising Indigenous people’s subjectivity, promoting Indigenous development and ensuring their rights and cultural safety at policy, professional and practice levels.

Industrialization of Medical Care: Perspectives of Policy Learning,I-Chun Liu,"medical tourism, policy learning, national health insurance policy, medical care, industrialization","As the economy becomes increasingly globalized, international air travel becomes more convenient, telecommunication develops more rapidly, health care services are no longer limited to a single region. With the global health care industry thriving, some national governments have stipulated that hospitals cannot only issue stocks, but also promote their services to patients worldwide. Because Taiwan is a relative newcomer to the area of medical tourism, the Taiwan government must study the experiences of other countries regarding the development of their medical tourism industries. The International Medical Services Flagship Program has been part of the government’s strategy to promote both the quality and the image of Taiwan’s health care industry, as well as to develop related industries and boost the domestic economy. The purpose of this study is to analyze the industrialization of health care services in Taiwan, based on semi-structured interviews with hospital representatives of the International Medical Services Flagship Program. We found that hospitals can benefit from industrialization, whether by gaining national recognition or international competitiveness, or by caring for more international patients. Simultaneously, these policies must both be profitable and be conducted within the budget. Consequently, hospitals have a strong incentive to develop policies to promote medical tourism because this will help develop the market. The study suggests that the relevant government units can study policy to understand the thinking and motivation of the medical service providers. Given that hospitals ensure that domestic patients’ rights, the government could open up the standards for health care advertising, as well as the mode of operation of international services.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qy0L7UnyvuIVkQH0auRpoFWai6Y1YETK/view,16.1,2012,Social Policy & Social Work

In the trend of professionalization, different countries have established step by step their own professional social work systems. In Taiwan, national social work examination was first held according to The Professional Social Worker Act in 1997. Social worker licensing system is, in general, divided into two categories: examination and registration. The licensing system based on examination has come to the most mature stage in USA. Japan, Taiwan, while China also adopts the licensing system on examination. The licensing system based on registration has long been adopted by UK, Germany, and France. Hong Kong and Singapore also have their own well-designed and well-managed registration system. The developing process of social work system in Taiwan can be defined in five stages: the import from the western world, initiating stage, formation stage, legalization, the critical developing stage since 2007.

Qualitative research approach was conducted in the study. The opinions of ten social workers who have participated in “security and prevention network of domestic violence” were gathered by unstructured individual interview. The study finds that most of the participants express the abused women lack of opportunity of using “client self-determination” as suffering long-term abuses, limited resources and high risk situation, albeit some participants respect the autonomy of client’s selfdetermination. Moreover, they worry about misunderstanding and abuse of “client self-determination” principles in their practice. Additionally, although most of them agree at some prerequisite for applying “client self-determination” but lack of agreeable opinion, and “client selfdetermination” in marital violence prevention is influenced by the clients, workers, organization structures as well as violence characteristics.

With the example of EU pension policy, this article sets out to examine the discourses on the European Social Model and the relevant development of EU social policy, in an attempt to comprehend how the Lisbon Agenda has formulated the idea of European Social Model and moulded a policy programme centred upon labour participation. The development of EU pension policy is a concrete epitome of the European Social Model as dictated in the mainstream EU discourses, which stress the modernization of traditional pension systems as well as the acquisition of pension entitlements through active labour participation. In its governance of pension policy, the EU has indirectly intervened in the pension institutions of its member states in various domains such as gender equality, free movement of labour, and single European insurance market. The increasing utilization of the Open Method of Coordination in this policy area further echoes, indeed justifies, the legitimacy of recent European pension reform directions.

The Effect of Government Policy on the Income Distribution of Elderly People Before and After Retirement: A Cohort Study,"Ming-Hwang Hong, Yi-Ting Lin","income distribution, cohort analysis, government transfers","The population of Taiwan is aging rapidly. Income levels after retirement and the effect that the economic security policies of various eras have had on the income distribution of elderly people are issues worthy of attention. Western studies have indicated that changes in the income distribution of elderly people after retirement vary with welfare systems. In Taiwan, no studies have explored the interaction between welfare policies and changes in income distribution before and after retirement. Combining the results of the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure and a cohort analysis, we discussed variations in the income distribution of three generations before and after retirement from 1989 to 2009. The results of this study are as follows: (1) As middle-aged and elderly people age, income inequality increases continuously prior to retirement. However, this income inequality decreases after they reach the age of 65 because the proportion of high inequality occupational income decreases. (2) The pension system is a contributor factor that increases inequality. The pension system’s effect in worsening income distribution increases annually. (3) Younger generations of elderly people experience greater income inequality. This phenomenon is partially attributed to malfunctioning governmental transfer or transformation. The pro-rich effect of old-age farmer annuity surpasses the“trivial poor-supporting effects”of old-age allowance and national annuity.",https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1lF7ZNgzRkP-4lUkz5a-05UQtoY8vR532&export=download,16.2,2012,Social Policy & Social Work

From the research conducted in this paper, the result shows that the deregulation of labor dispatch makes dispatching enterprises a booming market, which in turn puts more pressure on dispatched workers to survive in the fierce competition among dispatching enterprises. The reasons are as follows: firstly, in order to meet the demands for short-term labor dispatch contracts, dispatching enterprises make a fixed-term contract with dispatched workers, which has a significant negative impact on stable employment, secondly, regardless of the increase or decrease in dispatch expenditure, the decision-making role that dispatching enterprises play in dispatched workers’ service fee and salary has a significant negative effect on steady salary increase. The findings of this paper can be used as a reference as well as introspection for the development of labor dispatch social policy in both Taiwan and Japan.",https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1lF7ZNgzRkP-4lUkz5a-05UQtoY8vR532&export=download,16.2,2012,Social Policy & Social Work
Financial Crisis and Social Protection Reform in Taiwan: Path Dependence?,"Ying-Fang Chen, Jen-Der Lue","financial crisis, social protection reform, path dependence, productive, Taiwan","The financial crisis in 2008/2009 hit most of countries in the world. Taiwan also faced serious recession, such as high unemployment rate, increasing income inequality and poverty rate. A large number of workers were excluded from labor market and suffered poverty risk. Conventionally, efficacy theory and complementary approach hold opposite opinions about how the welfare state responses to globalization or financial crisis. However, they ignore that the state has the capacity of governance on social protection. In this article, we bring the role of the welfare state back into analysis to elucidate how the Taiwanese government dealt with the 2008/2009 financial crisis. Was the reform a path dependence or a paradigm change? In conclusion, we find that social protection reforms in Taiwan were constrained by productivism. Economic growth will eventually lift people out of poverty. Thus, the government concentrated resources on the financial and bank sectors, but social protection received less attention. Although government expenditure expanded during the crisis period, it was temporary. After the crisis, the government cut social expenditure. Promoting economic growth and cutting tax did not have positive impacts on working class and income inequality. Although the income transfer programs helped to reduce income inequality in 2008/2009, the government is reluctant to further income transfer programs. Thus, we concluded that the welfare reforms did not transform the Taiwanese welfare state toward social investment welfare state, but still stuck to productivism. In the long run, the Taiwanese social security system will be not sufficient to protect people if the government does not overhaul the social security system.",https://drive.google.com/u/0/uc?id=1lF7ZNgzRkP-4lUkz5a-05UQtoY8vR532&export=download,16.2,2012,Social Policy & Social Work

As a result, this study collected data from 12 male oral cancer survivors for their returns to work with in-depth interview method and examine the negligence of welfare institutions.

First, the advantages and barriers of return to work of male oral cancer survivors were correlated with the social conditions such as the job positions, the stage of suffering cancer, the level of support from work environment, and social class. Second, the problems that the interviewees can’t afford the workload and facing the difficulties on return to work was deemed as the individual problem, were caused by the invisible deficiency of health care policy of medical services for cancer. Third, some defects still exist in the labor policy about the economic security, sick leave and employment service. This study made three suggestions: first, the health care policy for cancer should not be restricted from the disease-focused framework of view, while stress more on the occupational rehabilitation.

Risk Factors That Impact the Well-being of Social Workers in the Area of Domestic Violence Prevention,Shu-Yuan Wang,"domestic violence prevention, social worker well-being, risk factors analysis","During the past two decades, as social workers in Taiwan involved themselves increasingly in preventing domestic violence, the well-being of front line social workers in this area has not received sufficient attention. In this study, a survey of the literature combined with new data from focus groups yields 21 factors that negatively impact their well being. The 21 were designed into a Likert scale questionnaire. 509 of these were sent to employees in public domestic violence prevention centers and NPOs involved in domestic violence prevention. 301 valid questionnaires were returned. A statistical analysis collapsed the 21 items into these 6 factors, in decreasing order of importance: (1) Poor working conditions and low pay, (2) The power academics wield in this area, (3) A general lack of respect for social workers as professionals, (4) The clients they are called upon to deal with and the complexity of the situations they face, (5) Organizational and supervisor issues, and (6) Personal issues. That poor working condition and low pay rank highest is consistent with previous studies. However, what stands out as surprising in this study is that the involvement of academic social work professionals should be viewed so negatively by workers in the domestic violence field. Obviously, it is incumbent upon academics in this area to set aside their stance of superior authority, adapt a more collaborative attitude, and take a more supportive stance towards workers in this field. Also surprising is the finding that the longer professionals have worked in the domestic violence field, the less importance they give to the factor “lack of respect as professionals.” Experience evidently gives them an intrinsic appreciation of the good that they do, which outweighs the need for extrinsic approval. The data also showed that workers with an MSW degree display more confidence in their profession and are less negatively impacted by “personal issues” than mere college graduates – which shouldn’t be surprising.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ux_iSQnsulRyYEoutj1_SOdeyM-l4pLl/view,17.1,2013,Social Policy & Social Work

Most immigrant wives married Taiwanese through the operation of profit-pursuing marriage brokerages (i.e. Zhongjie) that had been transformed into non-profit marriage agents (i.e. Xiehui) by Immigration Act amended in 2007. It is clear that Xiehuis play a key role on immigrant wives’ migrating process and living experiences in Taiwan. Concerned with these women’s welfare, this paper thus aims to explore the content of matchmaking services of Xiehuis. Based on in-depth interviews with 14 interviewees working in 12 Xiehuis, I show that the matchmaking services offered by Xiehuis are diverse, including “teaching” Taiwanese clients “correct” marriage attitude, “researching” Taiwanese clients’ background, “sifting” “good” bride-candidates, signing conditional marriage contract, “training” newlywed brides, and providing material assistance. I further found that these diverse matchmaking services, underpinned by profit-pursuing motivation, professional ethics, traditional family gender division and racialization, may protect immigrant wives from swindle, but may also restrict them to be empowered. To respond to the research findings and to improve immigrant wives’ wellbeing in Taiwan, this paper concludes by proposing recommendations for policy-making and enhancing programs and further research.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BYvhkJqv2ZlCS8e_2-FSmJcHcZecPKw/view,17.2,2013,Social Policy & Social Work

Maternity Allowance and Total Fertility: Evidence from Taiwan 1998 to 2010,"Wen-Chen Lin, Joe Chen, Shih-Chang Huang","total fertility rate, maternity allowance, Panel regression model, endogeneity problem","The decreasing total fertility rate has been a major public concern in Taiwan. Except the “5-year-old Children Education Subsidy” (starting from 2011) and the “Special Deduction for Preschool Children” (starting from 2012), the central government has failed to provide a complete and effective measure to boost the dropping birth numbers. On the other hand, local governments, however, promote child births with policies of a wider variety. Among them, the most popular and welcome policy is to distribute cash maternity allowance to child births in the jurisdictional area. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of using one-time-allowance to promote birth rate has never been seriously studied. With data from 23 jurisdictional area of Taiwan in the period from 1998 to 2010, panel regressions are used to investigate the relationship between total fertility rate and the distribution of cash maternity allowance by local governments. In order to resolve the potential endogeneity problem in the regressions, local government revenue is used as an instrument. The regression results suggest that there is positive correlation between total fertility rate and the amount of cash maternity allowance, but the effect is small. For women who want to have children in the first place, each NT$1,000 cash allowance raises total fertility rate by 0.0057",https://drive.google.com/file/d/14BYvhkJqv2ZlCS8e_2-FSmJcHcZecPKw/view,17.2,2013,Social Policy & Social Work
The Moderating Impacts of In-Home Services Utilization on Informal Caregiver’s Burden of Dependent Elders,Chih-Chung Huang,"home care services, family caregivers, caregiving burden, moderating variables, long-term care","Purpose: This investigation adopts the stress process conceptual framework to examine the moderating influence of formal services use by impaired elders on the negative consequences of caregiving for informal caregivers. The model is modified by defining formal services as a type of formal social support that can counteract the stress associated with various care recipient impairments. Methods: Using stratified random sampling, 300 caregivers receiving home care services were selected for the study. Data were compiled through self-administered questionnaires. Hierarchical regressions were used to test the hypothesized models. Results: The findings indicate home care service for care recipients can reduce the adverse effects of certain impairments on informal caregivers. Disruptive behaviors of the elders are significantly lowered. In addition, this study also confirms the moderating effects of formal services use by impaired elders on caregiving burden for informal caregivers. Conclusions: According to the results of this study, the application of a stress process conceptual perspective to identify the moderating effects of formal services use by impaired elders on the negative consequences of caregiving for informal caregivers are with theoretical and empirical data supported.

A Postmodern Lear,Ying-Chen Chang,"Jane Addams, social work, workplace resistance, neoliberalism","The Pullman Strike of 1894, possibly the most famous strike in American labour history, influenced the global labour movement afterward. Jane Addams was involved in negotiation between the employer and employees of Pullman Company but failed. Addams wrote a critique on the Pullman Strike titled ‘A Modern Lear’ in 1886. The controversial message of ‘A Modern Lear’ finally published until 1912. The most developed part of her analysis compared George Pullman with Shakespeare’s King Lear. At the heart of that comparison laid her belief that both Lear and Pullman held individualistic and patriarchal mentality. They both used power on their own but could not acknowledge that his daughters and his workers were capable of assessing their needs and making right decisions. Addams makes a clear statement about the connections between sympathetic understanding and social democracy. Under the influence of Neoliberalism and New Public Management, social work practice was driven by the free market and strict budget control. Social work has lost its mission on social reform. Even though social workers have initiated organized resistance in every part most social workers usually adopt routine resistance in their workplaces. Routine and covert resistance is kind of decaf resistance. Decaf, because it threatens nobody and changes very little. Such forms of resistance serve a therapeutic rather than transformative function. Švejkism is not open protest, its style ironical and cynical. It is a weapon of the oppressed, but does not necessarily to change the status quo. The radical changes in social work were marked by the encapsulation of marketisation and commodification which contradict the very essence of social work value. Under hegemonic Neoliberalism, social workers still fight not for their benefits only, but for the well-being of the disadvantages and for mission of social justice. In the current context, even just checking further neoliberalisation would be a welcome development. Fighting Neoliberalism is a holy war for ideals, morality and democracy. The defenders of Neoliberalism always remind us that ‘there in no alternatives’. However, with the pathos of classical tragedy in social work, we assuredly believe that ‘another world is possible and necessary.’",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXmUBGtSYxxyyENrrIcHzc8s-svcQ2kr/view,18.1,2014,Social Policy & Social Work

Mental Health Policy Reform and Service Delivery in England,Jin-Yong Wang,"mental health policy, community mental health teams, personalisation of services, service accountability","Although there have been much literature arguing the transformation of mental health policy in England, relatively few studies present mental health practitioners’ firsthand accounts of policy implementation and service delivery. Using qualitative interviews, this article intends to qualitatively disclose the details of contemporary mental health care in England and how it actually works in practice. The main findings of the research can be summarised into three themes. Firstly, in the aspect of government funding and partnership, the British government tried to provide integrated services, but it was found that mental health services have over-emphasised illness treatment and relatively ignored service users’ social needs. Secondly, in terms of mental health teams and professionals’ roles, there are positive and negative sides of interdisciplinary working. Thirdly, visions of mental health care that research participants propose are personalisation of services and service accountability. Based up the research findings, the author argues that power shift and resource redistribution are two critical factors that can substantially influence the result of policy reform and fundamentally change the way the service system operates in England.

Shifting Perspectives on Environmental Issues in Social Work and Some Implications for Social Work Education,Yen-Yi Huang,"person-in-the-environment, green social work, climate change, disaster, social work education","Natural or human-made disasters linked to climate change give rise to multiple ecological, physical, and social problems. The international social work community has voiced concern about the negative impacts of environmental crisis on disadvantaged and marginal populations, and believes that social workers can and should play an active role in helping to shape a more sustainable environment. The ‘person-in-environment’ approach in social work is a mainstream perspective emphasizing the relationship between individuals, their behavior, and the environment. Very often however, such interventions have tended to focus on the social rather than the physical environment. The degradation and disaster caused by climate change create the context for a new paradigm of social work, with greater emphasis on physical environmental issues and concerns. This article reviews shifting perspectives within the international social work community on environment, and considers the implications of new theories and practices for the education and professional development of social workers. In particular, it is hoped that the experiences and insights reported here may help to enrich the scope and diversity of social work education in Taiwan.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QqDdsRFCnSmnycGKNaajlvv5EblHVjX0/view,18.2,2014,Social Policy & Social Work

The findings are from an analysis of 3,249 news stories from the two mainstream print media, United Daily and China Times from January 1987 to December 2007, that is, from the decade before the passing of Social Worker Act until the decade following the passing. The Social Worker Act of Taiwan was promulgated in 1997, enabled social workers to acquire professional statuses similar to those in other fields (e.g., medicine, law, and accounting) by undergoing a national examination. The findings indicate that followed the promulgation of the Act the media have frequently reported social workers in playing the roles of social control and caretakers for the less attractive, more problematic, deviant, dangerous, or deficient groups in our society. It however overshadowed or weakened the role of social workers as spokespeople for the socially vulnerable and their pursuit of social justice through grassroots and collective forces.

A Community-based Promoting Indigenous Tribes Tourism Industry of the Process and Outcome: Tribal Promoter’s Perspective,Leang-Yang Lai,"community-based, indigenous tribes, tourism industry, ecotourism, sustainable development","Tourism is an important sector for tribe development since it can bring numerous benefits into the tribe, including money flows and employment opportunities. And this might take care of many tribe problems, such as aging population, population decreasing, and development stagnation. However, tourism in the tribe is different from the ordinary tourism, it emphasizes more on the cultural, historical and ecosystematic aspects of the whole tribe, Based on those specific features, tourism in the tribe should pay more attentions to cultural and environmental preservation, as well as sustainable development. In spite of so many positive influences, tourism can also bring wicked effects, such as destruction of traditional cultures, damage to the environment, and unequal distribution of benefits. Cultural and environmental preservation are major concerns for the tourism in the tribe. Furthermore, the profits from the tourism should equally distribute to the tribe people because it is based on the specific feature and the whole atmosphere of the tribe. These issues need to be addressed before the tribe decides to develop tourism. With semi-structural in-depth interview, we have collected qualitative data from 18 respondents living in 9 tribes in eastern Taiwan, and the major findings are as followed: (1) receiving government project is the initiator for tourism development in the tribe, (2) tribe people are more passive in the beginning stage, pay more attention to their own interests, and sometimes lead to boycott behavior, (3) the tribe people need more knowledge and trainings on tourism management, (4) due to limited size of the tourism in the tribe, it is not enough to attract young people back to the tribe. Three suggestions are offered: (1) in order to protect tribe subjectivity and autonomy, tribe people participation in the tourism design should be protected, (2) the training of personnel should integrate with tribal organization to increase interaction and communication, (3) through the development of whole tribe tourism, government should make more commitment on long-term investments and provide more professional counseling and companionship to the tribe.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNxaQL_1B5xzkY1BQtXotWHCQIHuDTUd/view,19.1,2015,Social Policy & Social Work
The Politics of Disability Classification and Redistribution Justice: A Case Study of Accessible Parking in Greater Taipei Area,Heng-Hao Chang,"International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability (ICF), disability parking, needs, politics of difference, redistribution","The qualification of disability parking space is politicalized because of recent reform of official disability qualification system. On the one hand, under the charity-medical mode of the old qualification system, all people with disabilities are qualified for disability parking permits, no matter they have mobility disability or not. It appeared that disability parking spaces were often occupied by people who did not need the accessible parking space. On the other hand, in the media, we can see the news of fake disability parking permit or people sell the permit. In theory, both the government official and the disability right advocators believe that when the Taiwanese government adapted the new disability classification system, International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability (ICF), the permit will only issue to people with mobility disabilities. However, there is no agreement to define “mobility disability.” In addition, under the new classification system, there is no serious discussion on the redistribution of resources to people with different disabilities. This paper uses multiple methods to explore the politics of disability parking space, including analyzing the documents of disability parking space, observing the management of disability parking space, and survey on the users’ experiences. This research shows the change of qualification system alone cannot prohibit the displacement of disability parking space. The politics of disability parking space reflects the conflict between charity-medical model and social model to disability. The policy makers should reconsider the disability policy seriously and utilize the new opportunity of the new classification system to address the redistribution justice in disability welfare.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gNxaQL_1B5xzkY1BQtXotWHCQIHuDTUd/view,19.1,2015,Social Policy & Social Work

A cross-sectional survey conducted in Hong Kong was employed to examine the concept of individualization and life course changes. Three groups that might face with potentially higher social risks were identified: males with higher educational attainment tend to postpone their life course plans, females who opt for a conventional life course plan, and the younger generation who aspire for alternative life courses. Findings revealed that increasingly diverse life course patterns are unavoidable. Social policy needs to be more flexible in responding to these choices, and to review institutionalized life course structures as well as the norms modelled.

However, kinship care placement is not always practitioners’ favorite option in Taiwan in terms of placing children. This study aims to understand related experience the practitioners have when they adopt kinship care placement, especially those challenges and debating issues they encounter. This study expects to propose concrete suggestions for implementing kinship care placement. For collecting data, focus groups, individual interviews and open-ended questionnaires are adopted in the study. There are three main findings regarding the difficulties and controversies in kinship care placement: First, the legal regulations and the practical situations are not on the same page. Second, the practitioners show different understandings of the definition of ‘kin’ and the financial supports for kinship carers. Third, different points of view are expressed by the practitioners on professional trainings for kinship carers. According to what study have found out, we suggest that kinship care placement should be supported by legal systems to protect the wellbeing of children as well as practitioners.

With a threshold set at 10%, the results showed that CHE household, accounting for 16.85% households, had average annual food spending less than the control group by 18.69%, indicating that households may reduce food spending to cope with medical expenditures. Among CHE household with lowest quintile income, 95.24% of them hadn’t received any government medical subsidy. That may due to the fact that their medical expenses may or may not meet the threshold ($20,000-50,000) to receive medical subsidy from government.

Base on the dimensions of the financial model, the duration for financial balance, the premium rate growth, the funding amount, and the population growth rate, this study designed 7 simulative programs of the premium rate. Tables 1-4 showed the outcomes of programs A-G, including: the premium rate, the growth of the premium rate, the level of premium fee and the accumulated amount of funding. According to the financial model of partial funding, the frequency of premium rate adjustment, the growth of premium rate adjustment, intergenerational justice, and the accumulation of funding amount, program C and F were the more appropriate ones. The conditions of the premium rate in program C included: (1) 10 year-long duration for financial balance, (2) premium rate adjusted every 3 years. The conditions in program F included: (1) 10 year-long duration of financial balance, (2) premium rate adjusted every 3 years, (3) premium rate adjusted depending on the gap more than 5% between the calculated one and the existing one, (4) after the 3rd year, the funding amount should be able to pay more than the expenditure of 3 months.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFgACmVSH-j4VL81Zy0REE1ZPXHJTnYa/view,20.1,2016,Social Policy & Social Work
Evaluation Research of National Health Insurance Committee: The Perspectives of Committee Members,I-Chun Liu,"National Health Insurance policy, National Health Insurance committee, committee, process evaluation, operational effectiveness","Since 2000, the second generation National Health Insurance policy has focused on reforming its financial balancing mechanism. The key to reaching a balanced budget is to build a mechanism for ‘integrating two committees governing premium revenues and medical expenses into National Health Insurance Committee (here after NHIC) to coordinate the decisions of revenues and expenses closer with each other.’ A yearround procedure is established to connect global budget consultations, global budget negotiations, and premium rate negotiations under the integrated NHIC. However, this new mechanism’s ability to achieve the reform goal must be evaluated. The research is an operational process evaluation that explores effectiveness and the possible NHIC problems from the committee members’ perspectives. It also analyzes operational problems including the cognitive bias of committee members’ roles, the loopholes in the operational processes and lack of professional knowledge of some members. The advantages of the committee include expanding participation and complete legislative missions. This research recommends that the government can present the appointees’ principles, provide administrative resources to help members analyze healthcare-related information, and promote members’ professional skills.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFgACmVSH-j4VL81Zy0REE1ZPXHJTnYa/view,20.1,2016,Social Policy & Social Work
Effects of Migration and Healthcare Recourse on Health Status of Aborigines,Chien-Chia Liu,"migration, aborigines, area deprivation, health disparities","The life expectancy gap between aborigines and main stream reveals the ethnic health disparity, in the mean times, the high migration rate in aborigines comes into noticed as well. Based on the data of the Taiwan Indigenous People Survey (TIPS), this paper applies multiple linear regression model to examine the health status of different migrants and to analyze the changing quantity of areal healthcare resource between original and destination. The main findings are as follows. (1) Although migration can alter the accessibility of healthcare resource, the effect of local healthcare resource on health status is not significant. The better healthcare resource in local areas does not ensure the better healthcare resource utilization for aborigines. (2) The higher cultural environment variation that migrants went through might put them under high mental stress and therefore become harmful to their health status. (3)The migrations are drive by other structure factors rather than regional healthcare resource. (4) The ethnic health disparity results in socioeconomic factors rather than area deprivation of healthcare resource.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFgACmVSH-j4VL81Zy0REE1ZPXHJTnYa/view,20.1,2016,Social Policy & Social Work

By doing so, the authors tried to propose a design suitable for delivery systems, which may enhance quality of service and increase citizens’participation. Fourteen service users participated in in-depth qualitative interviews of this research. The results are as follows: (1) There are labels to service users, needs assessment is too rigid. (2) Based on their status, power, and roles, the users can be divided into four categories: double disadvantaged, those with gratitude, those who actively participated, and those being excluded by mainstream welfare information. (3) For the design of the service delivery system, users were ignorant of the policy-making and service type. (4) They experienced weak system link among various service projects. (5) Users showed gratitude to the service personnel, and lack of power in the development of service. Regarding service quality, it is inadequate in terms of responsiveness, appropriateness, user participation, providing service information, and service integration. This study recommends: (1) clients may be called ‘service users’, service evaluation may be changed to ‘integrated assessment model’. According to the research findings, design policy promotions in accordance with characteristics of different types of service users. (2) For the service delivery system, policy implementation should be coordinated among different districts, grasp the needs, expand service, value the collaboration among different service units, select and train professional manpower, and establish mechanisms for citizen’s participation. (3) The six service quality indicators should be included to measure the influences and resultant changes of the service on the service users.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFgACmVSH-j4VL81Zy0REE1ZPXHJTnYa/view,20.1,2016,Social Policy & Social Work
Bringing the Family Back in: The Political Economy of Family in Taiwan and Hong Kong,"Hsiang-Lan Liu, Yu-Fang Chang","political economy, state apparatus, care crisis, disciples of social sciences, family","The purpose of this paper is taking the perspective of political economy to explore the family in Taiwan and Hong Kong from the 1980s to the present days, with a special focus on the divisions of care responsibilities among family, market and state, that are heated by the care crisis of low fertility, demographic ageing, extended life expectancy and the change of female roles. The authors argue that we should bring the family back in the historical context and embed it in a political economic structure. Due to traditional disciples of social sciences, the family has been long a missing part in the studies of political science, economics, and political economy, while studies on family also neglect the characteristics of political economy. As we trace back and embed the family in these areas from the process of social development, we clearly find family’s dual kinds of nature of economic production and political stability. Following the reorganization of family, market and state imposed by demographic shift, industrial transformation and changing female roles, we will need an analysis of political economy that is helpful to examine the family in the dynamic and complicated historical and structural contexts. Then, the importance of family, as the primary group of human beings, can be rediscovered and recognized for fostering the capabilities and wellbeings of the family.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vFgACmVSH-j4VL81Zy0REE1ZPXHJTnYa/view,20.1,2016,Social Policy & Social Work
Social Work Supervision under Risk Management,"Yea-Huey Sheu, Ying-Chen Chang","social work supervision, external supervisor, risk management, new managerialism","As an essential practice to assure quality of social work service and professional performance, the feature of social work supervision nowadays has been largely modified by growing claims of risk management and increasingly demands for cost-efficiency evaluation. Most social work practice fields developed varied forms of supervision, from traditional internal and individual supervision to external and group supervision, to ameliorate the negative impact on social workers from their risk environment. Many academic educators and senior practitioners are recruited as external supervisors to participate in frontline practice. Most of social workers received various supervisions from internal and external supervisors, individually and collectively. What are the boundaries between internal and external supervisors? How is it designed and rationalized? Do these different forms of supervision truly response to needs of social workers, or just a risk management procedure? In the early history of social work, the function of supervision was administrative rather than educational or supportive. During the early years of twentieth century, the supervision was shifted to educational function to impart required values, professional knowledge and practice skills. From 1990s, under the influence of new managerialism and risk society, the function of supervision was heavily emphasized on administrative accountability and large demand for external supervision was developed. As a general agreement, social work supervision has three main functional elements, educational, administrative and supportive. However, it is not uncontested as a trade-off between managerial and professional concerns. The new managerialism and risk society have disrupted the stability of social work supervision. This article looks at the struggling and difficult positions social work practitioners faced in Taiwan and how social work manage, response and keep balance between various required supervisions, especially in protective social work field. The concept of ‘risk management’ is also introduced to analyze its development and a reflective model is proposed for good practice of social work supervision.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ujz7hoK6cxiMN_-PFOqxu5BmbT6iGbTe/view,20.2,2016,Social Policy & Social Work
The Image of Taiwanese Domestic Violence: From the Perspective of ‘A Web in the Patriarchal Clan System’,Shih-Mei Tai,"domestic violence, battered woman, grounded theory, patriarchy, clan system","The Power and Control Wheel developed in the United States is often used in social work to explain the dynamics by which women are subjected to domestic violence. However, alternative (non-Western) discussions on Taiwanese domestic violence have been scant. This study adopted the concept of A Web in the Patriarchal Clan System, proposed by Japanese-American scholar Mieko Yoshihama, which took into consideration an Asian sociocultural context, as a foundation to study domestic violence against women. A qualitative approach was employed in conjunction with grounded theory to revise the perspective of A Web in the Patriarchal Clan System and discuss domestic violence in Taiwan. Snowball sampling was used to recruit female victims, as well as social workers who have directly or indirectly served the victims, in the Taipei Metro Area. A total of 24 participants were recruited to attend five focus groups. Data analysis results indicated that domestic violence against women in Taiwan is no longer a matter that is solely between the victim and the offender. Domestic violence is an ever-changing array of violence that is centered on the public’s justifying of violence. According to the results of this study, the researcher provides recommendations pertaining to policy system and operational dimensions for formulating domestic violence prevention measures in Taiwan: (1) placing greater emphasis on the strategies of domestic violence prevention, such as investing in preventative service in communities, (2) ensuring accessibility to medical and health services, (3) offering community-involved rescue mechanisms, (4) training relevant professionals, and (5) developing long-term living and employment support for victims of domestic abuse. By enhancing these strategies, the connection between the offender’s abusive actions and environmental factors can be severed, public opinion can be transformed into positive support, and the patriarchal influence on women in households and workplace can be mitigated. Furthermore, support provided by the women’s families should be enhanced, and ignorance of violence of the husbands’ families should be changed, in order to collapse the concept of ‘justifying violence’ and liberate female victims from domestic violence.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ujz7hoK6cxiMN_-PFOqxu5BmbT6iGbTe/view,20.2,2016,Social Policy & Social Work

An Analysis on Japan’s Elder Abuse Prevention and Caregiver Support Law: Lessons to Taiwan’s Elder Protection,Hubert Chia-Yung Liu,"elder abuse, elder protection, Japan","The Elder Abuse Prevention and Caregiver Support Law, which is the first legislation specifically dealing with elder abuse, has been implementing since 2006 in Japan. This new perspective toward the elderly abuse sets on a milestone in which the elderly abuse is clearly defined by law, and it suggests a prevention strategy cooperating with multiple stakeholders. In this way, the Elder Abuse Prevention and Caregiver Support Law is beneficial to prevent the occurrence of elder abuse, and it is also helpful to early intervention for the elder abuse. This research adopts documentary analysis, which is a sort of qualitative research method, facilitates our analysis in depth. The analytical data include journal articles, newspaper, books, and so on. The findings include, firstly, the implementation of the Elder Abuse Prevention and Caregiver Support Law is closely related to the introduction of the Long Term Care Law in 2000. Meanwhile, the public requests and professional groups also facilitated opening the window of policy opportunities. Secondly, according to its core spirit, the prevention of the elder abuse does not only rely on the mandated report and abuser’s punishment, but also focuses on the government’s policy, protection for the abused elderly, and assistances to the abusers. Finally, the author claimed that the concept of the elder abuse prevention network in Japan is a significant mechanism for the prevention of elder abuse in Taiwan. In conclusion, the Elder Abuse Prevention and Caregiver Support Law may give lessons to the development of Taiwan’s elder abuse prevention in the future.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ujz7hoK6cxiMN_-PFOqxu5BmbT6iGbTe/view,20.2,2016,Social Policy & Social Work

In contrast Bonoli’s perspective, we argue that compressed modernity, institutional legacies and contingencies should be taken into account. Although Taiwan and Korea both faced compressed modernity and prioritised traditional social protection systems to deal with old social risks and vie for political supports, they have different speeds and paths of social investment turn due to different national institutional legacies. In Taiwan, the state’s capacities of finance and reform were severely constrained by its institutional legacies. Therefore, political actors could not channel social expenditure from protective social policies into active social policies. By contrast, Korea’s immature social protection system and the 1997 Asian financial crisis not only led to higher financial capacity but also provided opportunities which helped political actors to introduce active social policies to deal with new social risks and vie for political supports from female and other vulnerable groups.

This study invited social workers who were in charge of implementing the mandated parenting education programs in each city and county to fill out a questionnaire and to calculate the number of child abuse reports. The research findings show that there were 166 cases that had completed the mandated parenting education programs in 2012. Among them, 13 cases reported child abuse incidents again in 2013.

However, in some countries where public policies fail to exercise effect, private transfers for income redistribution become more effective. Previous study less compared the effect of the public policies on the middle class among Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. Hence, this paper used the Luxembourg household income database from 2005 to 2013 to analyze the effects of public transfers, private transfers, and income tax on the middle class among Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan in the 2000s. Additionally, this paper compared the time variant difference between Taiwan and Korea as well. The research results were: 1. Analysis of the family composition of the different social classes (categorized according to their income) showed that in Taiwan and South Korea, the proportion of older adults living alone (one person) or older couples living together (two people) in the lower class was significantly higher than those in the middle and upper classes. In Japan, because of the presence of the public annuity system, this phenomenon was less pronounced. 2. In Japan, the effect of public transfers on increasing the middle class and decreasing the lower class was greater than that in Taiwan and South Korea. By contrast, the effect of private transfers on expanding the middle class and diminishing the lower class was greater in Taiwan and South Korea than in Japan. In addition, the income redistribution effect of public transfers in Taiwan and South Korea decreased in 2012-2013. 3. In Taiwan and South Korea, the income tax systems were relatively ineffective: the effects of income tax and social insurance charges expanding to the middle class were less than those of public transfers.

The data are collected from in-depth interviewing with 15 social workers who have more than five years working experience in social work as well as practical experience in leading groups. Data is interpreted by using hermeneutic circle to discover the meanings and to achieve understandings. The findings of the research present that the professional cultivation processes of practitioners in social group work are beginning with higher education, going through by participating in groups, observing groups, as a co-leader of groups and as a leader of groups, in order to move from novices to expert practitioners. When key critical events are experienced, the practitioners could be more flexible on adopting social group work. Accordingly, the research recommendations include: (1) to develop an educational and training approach based on “experience learning” and “practical-based”, (2) to cultivate practitioners to be mentors to coach students and novices, and (3) to form a mentorship of practicing social group work. This study not only concerns with the “lost” in the field of social group work, but also focus on the transition in the field. Most of all, this study would awaken spiritual heritage and construct professional identity of practitioners, as well as deepen the professional field of social group work.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qFOZJYHD24bwn2CXcj1tok-Gdeq7i8B_/view,22.2,2018,Social Policy & Social Work
"High Risk, Low Will: Exploring the HelpSeeking Experiences of High Risk Battered Women in Intimate Partner Violence",Ching-Hung Shen,"help-seeking, high risk, intimate partner violence, low will","“High risk but low will” of battered women are the obstacles which social workers of domestic violence incessantly encounter. Therefore, the research aims to understand the reasons of the battered women with “high risk but low will”, and to explore the experiences of them while mandated to services. Fifteen battered women were recruited as interviewees from different counties invited by social workers and police. Individual interviews were conducted to collect data. It was found that most of the interviewees were highly aware of their dangerous situation. However, they refused to be mandated to services from social workers and police in consideration of being threatened by their batterers. Besides, ill financial condition, ineffective services, their uncompleted plans, and wishes of living with their batterers stopped them from seeking helps. It was noteworthy that negative experiences of services network also lead to the interviewees’ low will for formal service. Most of the interviewees felt caring but lack of empathy from social workers and police in the services. According to the results, the study suggests that ‘low will’ clients still have needs for service. To avoid pushing them away from formal helping systems while being referred, providing stable quality and multiple services, as well as resources allocation are highly recommended for enhancing battered women’s low will.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ui97SaFLoVt1kS-JjYpHpZl0iLsaQaMn/view,23.1,2019,Social Policy & Social Work

A Study on the Recovery Process of People Beginning in Drug Use during Adolescence,"Shin-Yin Liu, Yu-Wen Chen","adolescence, drug use, recovery process","In the past few years, the number of adolescent drug abusers has increased sharply and became a serious problem. Although some research had explored related issues, most focused on prevention rather than recovery. To better understand the process of recovery, this study attempted to examine the experience of those who used drugs in adolescence, tried to understand their motivation for not using drugs, and factors facilitating their recovery. The study used a qualitative research design and conducted in-depth interviews with 5 individuals who had a history of drug use during adolescence, and has recovered for at least 6 months. Research findings indicated that their motivation to change happened during critical events, such as being prisoned, or after a serious car accident. These events were defined as a turning point for recovery. In general, there were 5 stages in their recovery process, including: a turning point, an abstinence of physical addition (the transitional period), determination, psychological and social recovery, and finally, the continued abstinence. The study also examined the facilitating factors during their recovery process. These included religion, support from family members and friends, going back to school, or being employed. Based on these results, the study suggests that professionals working with young drug users should start with building up a non-authoritarian relationship and be a friend to them. Moreover, they should also work closely with other professionals to create a supportive environment for these young drug users. Furthermore, an integrated service system from family, school and community should be established to better assist their recovery.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDXSVWC3J5Fer71as6ulCo7OWZogPiW5/view,23.2,2019,Social Policy & Social Work

Also, the situation could affect the social workers’services to the vulnerable patients as well as their family in the hospitals. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to explore the medical social workers’experiences of empowerment with his/her supervisors during the process of supervision. The main research questions are to explore how the social workers transform those experiences into their own power, what their supervisors used to shape the strategies of empowerment, what the distances are between the disempowerment and empowerment. This study adopts the qualitative research method and includes in-depth interviews of eight medical social workers to explore their experiences. The results of the study show that the social workers who feel disempowerment at the aspects of casework, teamwork and hospital administrative organization may initiate a fourstage empowerment process. The process includes that the supervisees find the improvement of their inner strengths, recognize the value of social work, rethink the direction of their work and embark on fighting for professional equality as a result of the supervisors’empowerment conducts. The following four suggestions have been put forward. Firstly, it is suggested that the training programs for the supervisors be integrated into the general education and training courses of the social work department. Secondly, the supervisor is expected to lay great emphasis on his/her own example. Moreover, the social work department should advocate social work professional value within the internal organizations.

Since its official implementation in 2017, its operation model and implementation strategy have been adjusted and revised. The operation of care management and the establishment of public-private partnerships are closely related to the implementation of the community’s integrated care service system, which is worthy of in-depth review and exploration. This study takes Nantou County as the main research field, using in-depth interviews with care managers of the long-term care management center and case managers or leaders of private organizations to collect data. The research results show that at the care management level, there are difficulties such as unclear authority and responsibility allocations, inefficiency, lack inter-professional teamwork and insufficient longterm care resources. In addition, the government’s long-term care policy is still changing, private sector’s role in decision-making is minimal, the administrative system have long been alienated from each other, and the role of empowerment is not obvious. The public-private partnerships are facing the challenge of loosening and disintegration. At the end of this article, several suggestions are made on care management and partnership, including care management center as the only contact, enhancement of related knowledge about inter-professional teamwork, building a long-term care resource network, and establishment of a mechanism of decisionmaking involvement and communications/dialogues, so as to integrate the divided long-term care administrative system, strengthen the government’s administrative efficiency and role of empowerment, and shape the publicprivate partnership that is equal, respectful and trusting",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xDXSVWC3J5Fer71as6ulCo7OWZogPiW5/view,23.2,2019,Social Policy & Social Work

Meanwhile, the concepts of collective culture right and environment right echo with the wave of global indigenous rights movements. With the rising awareness of and demand for collective rights, the practice of indigenous social work today has encountered three major challenges: the dated individualized welfare system, the individualized service delivery of resources, and the mentality of cultural hegemony when designing and delivering welfare services.

With these confusions, group workers continue to explore, imitate, and learn from experience through “learn by doing, doing while learning”, and hone their courage to respond to various changes in the group. If you can be accompanied and supervised by the supervisor in this process, you can reflect on your actions and gradually transform into a group worker.

Latent Transition Models for Longitudinal Sociology Study: Aparadigm of adolescences deviant behavior development,"Chih-Chien Yang, Chyi-In Wu","Latent Transition Model, E-M algorithm, Adolescent Aggressive Behaviors, Sociological Longitudinal Study.","In a longitudinal study, antecedents can often be the important indicators and/or predictors of consequences. Many sociologists and educational practitioners investigated sequential behaviors of adolescents to be able to proceed effective intervention/ prevention programs. We demonstrate that latent transition modeling (L TM) is a good statistical modeling method for revealing sequential relationships. Theoretic derivations as well as computational implementations of latent transition modeling are discussed in this paper. Substantively, we studied items (Wu, 1999) that surveyed adolescent aggressive behaviors across years to model the latent transition probabilities of the behaviors among these adolescents. Using this example, we further provide substantive interpretations of conducting L TM methods and demonstrate the practical importance of L TM in substantive research fields.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=103,9,2001,Survey Research - Method and Application
Sample Characteristics of the Internet Population: Web Survey Follow-up and Personal Network Sampling Compared,Yang-chih Fu,"online survey,personal network sampling, follow-up interview,email ties,sampling design","Online surveys challenge traditional social surveys with several advantages. Due to non-probability sampling and low response rates, however, most online surveys face fundamental flaws. This paper reviews these flaws and 1imits by exploring key characteristics of on1ine samples. The study employs two sampling designs to collect data. One design follows those who responded to an ear1ier web survey, while the other uses exclusive snowball samp1ing by personal networks. The resulting “online survey follow-up"" sample (n= 76) and “ personal networks""sample (n= 107) contribute to a total of 4492 relationships with alters in the email communication during the past 30 days, and 4674 incoming as well as 3504 outgoing one-on-one personal emails during the past 14 days. These three sets of data are joined and analyzed respectively at the individual, relationship, and contact levels. Major findings suggest that the active respondents in online surveys show distinctive attitudes and values toward the use of online communication. To them the messages exchanged online are important. But the transactions are so transient and fleeting that most messages are not worth keeping. The differences between the two samples are significant and unique in that no other sample characteristics show similar patterns, which further indicates the idiosyncratic tendency among the samples collected by online surveys.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=102,9,2001,Survey Research - Method and Application
The Third-person Effect in Survey Interview,Su-hao Tu,"response effect,response quality, interview situation, the presence of the third person, social desirable, sensitive,and factual questions","Interviewers are trained to conduct private interviews but would find that the presence of others in practice is hard to avoid. Despite of divergent conc1usion, most of the previous studies sup port the importance of the third-person effect. This study examines the extent to which the presence of the third-person affects survey response across three types of questions concerning family, marriage and gender roles respectively Characterized by fact, sensitivity, and social desiribility attributes. The data analyzed is from Social Change Survey conducted in 1996. The quality of response to factual questions is found better than that to other types of questions. However, logistic regression analysis shows that the presence of the third-person does not affect the quality of response to three types of questions. On the other hand, the actual response to factual and sensitive questions varies with the presence of the third-person. The third-person effect does not happen to the response to the questions with social desirability. This study does not fully support the hypotheses that the third-person would affect the quality of response and actual response to sensitive and social desirable questions more than that to factual questions. However, it the findings does not totally reject the third-person effect. In conclusion, theoretical development and empirical studies on the third-person effect are needed in the future.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=101,9,2001,Survey Research - Method and Application

They reveal that people's opinions about air, water and waste disposal develop not only from their daily living experiences but also from their knowledge of environmental protection efforts. In the field of safety, gender is the most important predictor in perceived concepts of importance involving personal safety and public security. The survey also indicates that the higher the educationallevels of respondents the lower their tolerance of accidents. Concerning economics, the opinions of respondents aged from 20 to 29 are significantly different from other age-groups basically because these people have either not yet experienced the major turning points of their individual lives or are about to do so.

"A Reflection on the Usage of Difference Scores: The Discussion on Reliability, Interpretation, Construct Meaning, and Measurement Equivalence",Hsin-Hua Hsiung,"difference scores, reliability, measurement equivalence, latent growth modeling, response surface model","Difference scores are widely used in social science researches and are aimed to evaluate the consistency between constructs. However, there are some methodological controversies regarding the usage of this research method. These controversies are categorized in four aspects: reliability, interpretation, construct meaning, and the measurement equivalence of the difference scores. This study attempts to show that the degrees of urgency of the problems encountered in these four aspects are not the same. It varies in different kinds of difference scores. For instance, if the study is focused on measuring change by time, then the researcher should focus on the aspect of reliability. Fortunately, this problem is not very serious. On the other hand, if the study is meant to measure different subjects and different constructs, then the researcher must deal with the problems in all four aspects. Although problems as to the usage of difference scores exist, it is still imperative for some studies. This paper tries to provide some ways to lessen the amount of difficulties involved and evaluates them. There do possess, however, other alternatives that researchers may avail of, such as ""latent growth modeling"",""differential item functioning"", ""direct comparison"", and ""response surface model"". These methods have their unique application contexts.

Two hundred college students participated in a survey. Half of them were merely asked about the frequency of their behavior, and the other half were further questioned about the behavior details. Results suggested that though both groups might have over-reported or over-estimated their proenvironmental behavior, the crossquestioned group were less likely to do so.

Attrition in Matched Manpower Utilization Surveys,Ruoh -Rong Yu,"manpower utilization survey, attrition, matched files","The Manpower Utilization Survey (MUS) conducted by Directorate General of Budget Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) since year 1978 is a rotating monthly survey. Because of this sampling frame, about a half of the sample in any two consecutive months could be matched. Further, in any given month, about a half of the sample in a given year could be matched with those in the following year. Thus, matching person records across MUS files could result in short panels. Though the matched MUS files have been widely applied in empirical analysis, the limitation of the files has not been discussed yet. By utilizing the 1979-2001 March MUS files, this paper analyzes the determinants of attrition from the MUS.

The Construction of Fuzzy Linguistic Numbers for Questionnaire and Its Empirical Study,Yuan Horng Lin,"binary logic, fuzzy linguistic variable, fuzzy theory,Likert scale","The purpose of this study is to construct fuzzy numbers of questionnaires by objective function algorithm. In the traditional research method, we often investigate the latent traits of people by means of Liker scale or semantic differential scale. From the relative research finding, there are two problems worthy of discussing. The first one is that it is lack of reasons to transform linguistic variables into crisp and interval values. The other one is that the process of thinking is multi-logic in nature, which is quite different from the binary-logic assumption of traditional questíonnaíres. There are some literatures based on fuzzy theory to dissolve the above questions. According to most of these literatures, they reveal that the fuzzy logic is appropriate for questionnaire-design and the data analysis. As to the fuzzy linguistic variables, we often record them into fuzzy numbers. On the contrary, there are few researches discussing how to construct the corresponding fuzzy numbers of items.

An Analysis of Poll Performance and the Influential Factors of “Trail Heat,Chien-Chou Su,"Presidential election, Polling accuracy measurement","The majority of surveys often cannot be evaluated due to a lack of actual feedback. However, pre-election polls offer a unique advantage that it can be examined by the final outcome of the election. Through measuring the margin of error from the final vote tally, we can improve the survey methodologies in a wide area of application. N evertheless, few research has focused on assessing Taiwan's pre-election poll performance in the past. In Taiwan, people are becoming more and more interested in and concerned with election campaigns. Before every important election, journalists, pollsters, and political commissions perform dozens of pre-election polls. Therefore, we can have sample size large enough to make quantity analysis now.

The Differences of the Minimum Living Costs between Adults and Children,"Te-mu Wang, Hua-chin Ho, Chao-hsien Leu","minimum living costs,the percentage of the cost of children, Iso-prop","Poverty is usually determined on the basis of household as the unit not by individual. For this reason, the different needs of the household members tend to affect the poverty threshold which further influences the composition of the poverty popula¬tion. The official poverty threshold in Taiwan makes no distinc¬tion between the needs of an adult and a child, nor the differences between them in economies of scale of household consumptions. This method tends to shortchange single elderly households in its calculation of the distribution of poverty population composition. There exists a theoretical bias in treating the needs of adults as the same from children. In this research, we employ three differ¬ent cost methods, those of Engel, Rothbarth, and Iso-Prop, in an attempt to resolve the problems in determining the minimum cost of living differences between adults and children and also to cal¬culate the ratio of children cost to those of adults. A clear understanding of the differences of the minimum living costs between adults and children will not only make it easier to deter¬mine the low income population but will also be useful for govern¬ment to set up the level and amount of welfare expenditure for children. For example, it can be used to estimate the living sup¬ply, child care, schooling allowance, etc., for the children in low income families. These calculating methods are also helpful to the government on the estimation of the welfare expenditure for children. The results of our analyses show that the parameters calculated by the Engel method tend to overestimate while those by the Rothbarth method tend to underestimate the values with the Iso-prop method falling somewhere in between the two. Finally, we found that using the Iso-prop method to calculate expenditure with the FCSU figures, the percentage of the cost of children in the household with one parent was 0.71， while with both parents present the same figure was 0.68.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=69,13,2003,Survey Research - Method and Application

The construction of MUQLS and NOMUPD is mainly implemented through SAS v8.1. MUQLS is essentially longitudinal, including more than 530 thousand individuals, while NOMUPD remains cross-sectional in nature, including around 790 thousand individ¬uals. Out major contributions in constructing these databases are that MUQLS is not only fairly cost-efficient relative to ordinary longitudinal surveys, but also helps us overcome many research constraints, moreover, NOMUPD helps us reduce the conventional danger of selection bias when using the pooled MUS data. In addition to sharing our experiences in constructing MUQLS and NOMUPD, this article also uses a simple example to demon¬strate the potential importance of MUQLS and NOMUPD in aca¬demic researches. In the end, some suggestions are proposed for future developments, including (1) establishment of standardized procedures in extending the MUQLS and NOMUPD, (2) construction of Generalized Quasi-longitudinal Human Resources Survey (GQLHRS) based on the existing techniques in constructing MUQLS, (3) setup of user-friendly interface on the internet to help the sharing of data, and (4) opening-up source codes to public access and establishment of user forum and feedback mechanism.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=68,13,2003,Survey Research - Method and Application

Community Attachment and Quality of Life in Taiwan: An Application of Latent Class Analysis,Pei-Shan Liao,"interactional theory, community attachment, quality of life, latent class analysis, community participation","The concept of quality of life has been suggested to develop in regard to the mutual logical dependence between individual and society/community. Community, from the perspective of interactional theory, provides a setting and the mechanism of empirical contact between the individual and society. It is, there¬fore, essential to consider the role of community in terms of the sentiment and participation dimensions when studying individual life quality. This paper attempts to examine the contribution of community attachment to individual quality of life while control¬ling for sociodemographic characteristics. The data were drawn from the Taiwan Social Change Sur¬vey (Questionnaire No. 2). A sample of 2,835 completed question¬naires was used for the analysis. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was employed to reveal a latent structure of 32 participation pat¬terns of community activities. A latent variable with four latent classes, namely fully involved participants, local activity partici¬pants, cultural activity participants, and unconcerned partici¬pants, was obtained as an indicator of the participation dimen¬sion of community attachment. Ordinal regression was employed to examine the effects of community attachment on individual quality of life. Both sentiment and participation dimensions of community attachment were found to contribute to a better qual¬ity of life.

The two statistical methods used in this study are Chi Square test and Logit analysis. Furthermore, this paper has put an effort in establishing a model for explaining the non-response problem in order to aid the researchers becoming oriented with the possible impact, be it negatively or positively, on the results of survey research in Taiwan. The factors influencing the non-respondent problem are quite consistent with the previous findings of other scholars except for some variables which may interact with interviewees' political attitude on vote intention questions.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=53,15,2004,Survey Research - Method and Application
Consumer Preference and Willingness to Pay for Genetically Modified Salmon in Taiwan,"Tsu-Tan Fu, Chin-Chi Chuang, Cheng-Wei Chen","Consumer Preference,Genetically modified foods, Risk Premium,Contingent Valuation method","This paper attempts to analyze consumer preference toward genetically modified(GM) salmon and to estimate willingness-to-pay a premium for non-GM salmon. To serve such purpose, we conducted an islandwide telephone survey to Taiwanese consumers in 2003. Public risk perceptions and consumer acceptance for GM foods including salmon are investigated. While adopting a multinomial logit to identify preference groups, we also employ Hanemann (1984) approach to measure consumer willingness-to-pay for GM salmon. Empirical results have found that risk perception, price of salmon, gender and income are significant factors to explain consumer preference toward GM and non-GM salmons. Consumers willingness-to-pay for non-GM salmon is averagely estimated to be 49%(or 74 NT dollar per Taiwan kilogram) over current market price of salmon. These findings are critical market information for fishery and biotech industries.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=52,15,2004,Survey Research - Method and Application

Group Differences Comparison: Application of Bootstrap Approach to the Statistical Inference for Life Table Analysis,Hsin-Mu Chen,"Group Differences,Life Table Method, Resampling,Increment-Life Table,Bootstrap Approach,Statistical Inference","Group differences have been a major focus in social research. Typically, group differences are based solely on comparisons of expectancies, i.e., the expected pattern of behavior for the average individual in a group. Because these comparisons are substantive and not statistical, questions of whether groups are statistically different in their life course behavior patterns remain unanswered. Nowadays, sociological, findings for group differences are typically derived from large and nationally representative samples. Sampling variability is thereby introduced into the behavior model.  Moreover, social studies usually employ complex samples that make the traditional statistical inference procedures impossible. This calls for a new strategy to evaluate group differences statistically. Here, we describe one approach to statistically evaluate group differences. This approach allows researchers to estimate both the expected values and the variances for complex samples, thereby permitting formal statistical tests for group differences. We demonstrate this approach by using a multistate life table model. Traditionally, multistate life model operates at the population-level. Hence, we see the lack of attention to variability in the life table functions. Increasingly, however, demographers apply multistate life table methods to studies employing national complex samples. With the assistance of the approach we describe here, even the multistate life table method could be possibly applied to evaluate group differences.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=47,16,2004,Survey Research - Method and Application

Consistency and Accuracy in the Measurement of Daily Contacts: Surveys and Contact Diaries Compared,"Yang-Chih Fu, Yi-Jr Lin","Daily Contact,Contact Diary, Personal Networks","Survey research has relied on statistical tools to analyze how consistent behavioral items are. It would be more accurate, however, to examine the items with direct evidence, whenever such evidence is available. Using “daily contact” as the subject, this paper evaluates survey results against actual contact records complied from contact diaries. Data included three separate sets that 52 informants completed in 2004 in the following order: (1)a self-administered survey (the first survey),(2)diary-keeping of all interpersonal contacts for three months (n=4,776 days of data about average daily contacts),and (3)a telephone survey (the second survey, taken two months after the informants started keeping the contact diaries). The surveys contained a single-item question about the range of daily contacts (that included six ordinal response categories)and derivative questions about the composition of these contacts. Measured against their actual contact records, half of the informants made a precise estimate in the first survey about the range of their daily contacts. In the second survey, about three-fourth of the informants estimated their daily contacts correctly. The informants also assessed the gender composition among their daily contacts more precisely than they did with the proportion of the contacts that they initiated .Men and women tend to perceive daily contacts differently: men overestimate the volume of their daily contacts and the proportion of initiative contacts, on the contrary, women underestimate their daily contacts and the initiative contacts. Such subtle differences seem to reflect differential expectations of the gender role in the larger society. Using the diary records as the criterion, the study reveals evidence that justifies the use of ordinal response categories in the single-item measurement of daily contacts in large-scale surveys.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=41,17,2005,Survey Research - Method and Application

Exclusion of these responses will not only change the planned sample size but also bias the final benefit measurement. On the other hand, the responses of these samples could be deemed as alternative opinion to the survey. As long as the characteristics of these responses are realized and the effective sample size are modified accordingly the bias of benefit measurement should be controlled substantially.  The purpose of this study is then to systematically analyze the characteristics of protest responses and responses with “uncertain” for a set of data collected through double-bounded dichotomous choice with open-ended follow-up contingent valuation method for the benefit evaluation of Kenting National Park. The characteristics will be accomplished by a comparison between these two types of responses and that is deemed as effective sample traditionally. The results are to be used for the explanation and modification of traditionally effective sample. The benefit estimation will then be conducted and compared under different modified samples.  There are about 37.13%of responses that are characterized as protests and “uncertain” responses in this data set. The test results have indicated that the “uncertain” responses have certain characteristics toward effective responses and some toward protest responses. The effective samples are modified by assigning different offered price to the responses with “uncertain”. All these modified samples are estimated by model of OLS, Tobit, and multiple-hurdle with decision process.  The benefit estimation from the sample excluding the protest responses and responses with “uncertain” is biased upward. That is ,the traditionally effective sample has over estimated the benefit by about 66%-168% as compared with the sample modified by inclusion of protest responses under multiple-hurdle with decision process model. It if also consistent with the expectation that it has over estimated the benefit by about 112%-157% as compared with the sample modified by inclusion of both the protest responses and responses with“uncertain”.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=40,17,2005,Survey Research - Method and Application

This article examines the adequacy of their roles as the golden standards of population parameters. The study uses data from The 2001 National Health Interview Survey, The 2001 Taiwan’s Election and Democratization Studies, and some typical telephone surveys to compare sampling frames and coverage rates for each of the target population . The results show that neither census data nor household registration records can reflect the population status in Taiwan. One of the prime reasons is the large quantity of Taiwanese people living in mainland China for various reasons but the matter is not properly handled by the census and household registration authorities . Other causes such as methods of data collection for the census and quality of data maintenance of household registration records all contribute to the shortcomings of the correct population counts in Taiwan .Oh the other hand, telephone surveys tend to have the lowest coverage rates among all types of surveys.

In the election strategy field, most literatures emphasized the analysis of the attributes of candidates and voters, or use the order hierarchy technique to realize the relationship of them .However, very few studies integrated candidates and voters’ factors and considered resource allocation strategy. In this paper used the AHP technique to select resource allocation strategy, to evaluate the process of election, to check weather the allocation of resource is rational or not ,and to expect the AHP technique can provide feedback to build the timely and immediate election response system. In addition to re-allocating the limited election resource, AHP technique can modify decision process to fit the modern diversify election, apply it to future election, and use it to offer decision-maker rethinking viewpoints. In Taiwan, resulting from direct presidential election began in 1996,the experiences of presidential election only through three times so far. Therefore, the study of presidential election is just in the starting step in Taiwan. This paper tries to rely on the case of presidential election basing on Tainan city’s data in 2004. We employ AHP technique to analysis election strategy, to reduce the decision lag and responding slowly.  The AHP technique is not only offer the weight of election resource allocation, but also use sensitivity analysis to understand weather the decision goal and resource allocation are consistent or not .In addition to identifying priority resources to the election campaign goal and strategy, AHP technique offers election campaign decision-makers to adjust resource distribution in right time, reduce resource input unnecessary and waste, and link election between goal and strategy.

Different perspectives of educational measurement and political science have not reached agreement on the encouragement of the DK answers. Some of the previous studies have suggested that the encouragement of DK answers led to guessing response sets. This paper explores guessing response sets and their effect on the respondents’ knowledge levels by using genetics knowledge scale as an example. In particular, the changes of guessing effect were examined by considering the characteristics of respondent and interviewer.  Data were drawn from Taiwan Genomic Survey collected in 2003. A group of adults aged 18-64 were selected using three-stage stratified sampling scheme. A total of 1090 interviews were completed. The results showed that regardless of sample weighting, the average number of correct answers among the ten-item genetics knowledge scale was 6.15(with a standard deviation of 2.10), which was similar to those found in the United States, Canada, Japan, and European countries. Without controlling for other factors, the knowledge scores of the respondents who did not guess at all were significantly lower than their counterparts who fully guessed ,but were significantly higher than those who partially guessed .After controlling for the characteristics of respondent and interviewer, the knowledge scores of the respondents who partially guessed and fully guessed were lower than those who did not guess.  Guessing effect turned insignificant after controlling for other factors .For the respondents with a guessing rate between 0.01 and 0.99 ,whether their genetics knowledge increases with guessing rate requires further investigation. One of the reasons why guessing effect turned insignificant may be the discouragement of DK in the original survey design .In remains suggested to encourage more rigid experimental studies in the future.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=26,19,2006,Survey Research - Method and Application

However, this approach still exists some problems such as information missing, complicate calculation steps, and presumption of the type of membership function. In this research the authors use the membership functions drawn by experts and adopt the Mann-Whitney tese to examine the expert consensus both from Delphi and Fuzzy Delphi. The authors find that the convergence range of the Fuzzy Delphi is better than that of Delphi. The result also shows that Fuzzy Delphi can keep more complete information and deal with fuzzy linguistic.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=16,21,2007,Survey Research - Method and Application
Fuzzy Clustering for Rules Usage on Proportional Reasoning Test with Raw Rule Score,Yuan-Horng Lin,"fuzzy clustering ,proportional reasoning,rule of problem-solving","The purpose of this study is to analyze the rule usage of OJT by fuzzy clustering with multiple rule score. According to the findings of G. Noelting, pupils will adopt five rules in order to solve problems of OJT. The OJT is a proportional reasoning test and there are five rules of solving strategies. These five rules display different cognition capability on proportional reasoning. However ,as to the research of G. Noelting ,it was a qualitative approach and inferences was limited. Moreover, only dichotomous scoring was used and there were some difficulties when it went to classify the rule usage. Therefore, in this study, large sample size is acquired and classification method of fuzzy theory approach is adopted in order to classify the rule usage of pupils.  There are 869 pupils of fourth, fifth and sixth graders in this study. The score of OJT depends on these five rules so that each subject has five raw rule scores as to rule usage. The scoring of the OJT differs from most related research. Moreover, the author applies fuzzy clustering algorithm in the data analysis. Thanks to the fuzzy clustering, subjects will be properly classified. Therefore, patterns of rule usage for each group display the cognitive capability of those who belong to that group. In the  empirical study, it shows five groups are the best classifications of rules usage. Besides, each group represents one rule or mixture of rules with which fits the theoretic foundation of rule usage provided by G. Noelting. It also shows that patterns of rule usage vary with different grade of subjects, but not with gender .Finally some suggestions for future research and rule assessment methodology are provided.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=15,21,2007,Survey Research - Method and Application
Aggregate Travel Demand Analysis :A Cross-National Comparison,Ming-Hsiung Hsiao,"derived demand,aggregate travel demand, telecommunications demand,income elasticity,cross-national data.","In traditional travel demand theory, aggregate travel demand is considered being greatly impacted by socioeconomic variables. Technically, modeling the impacts of these socioeconomic variables on aggregate travel demand is somewhat established practice as long as the data needed are all available. Unfortunately, such data usually come from government and it’s affiliated departments and are often insufficient for modeling task. On this account, based on the existent data in Taiwan government departments, this study makes efforts to expand and refine them into a more complete dataset, and then uses such a data set to implement the modeling task .The expanded data set is a chronologically(1992-2004)cross-national(nine nations including Taiwan) one containing primary data needed for modeling travel demands. With these data, then it starts building travel demand models and estimating the corresponding parameters. The estimation results show that the national income and telecommunications development are the two variables having the most significant effects on travel demands. The small positive income elasticity indicates that rail is more like necessity goods, whose demand tends to remain steady irrespective of income effect. Moreover, telecommunications development has negative effect on public modes: rail and air, but has positive effect on the private mode: car. This implies that the telecommunications advancement is possibly to encourage the use of private mode, while discourage that of public more, a result that transportation planners would least like to see.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=14,21,2007,Survey Research - Method and Application

Analyzing data gathered by D&B International Inc, we found that both types of businesses are spatially clustered in Taiwan, but with different patterns, and that foreign firms are more geographically aggregated than domestic leading firms.  Both foreign and domestic leading firms are clustered in Taipei City, with about 73% and 60% of the foreign and domestic leading firms located in Jungshan, Sungshan and Daan districts of Taipei City. However ,domestic leading firms tend to be situated in the older districts of the city, while the foreign firms are more likely to be located in newly developed districts . Data also shows that both foreign and domestic firms tend to be clustered in places where high quality office space is located. In addition, less well-known foreign firms tend to cluster around well-known foreign firms, and less well-known domestic leading firms tend to cluster around well-known domestic leading firms.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=13,22,2007,Survey Research - Method and Application
GIS Survey Research on Measuring the Impact and Benefit of Urban Green Area Amenities by the Hedonic Price Method,"Cheng-Jui Chen, Wei -Jean Song","urban green area,public goods,hedonic price method,GIS","An urban green area can bring multiple benefits of ,such as, recreation, hazard prevention, climate adjustment etc. It is difficult to measure the value for each benefit. However, as a kind of public goods, its benefits will capitalize into the prices of the surrounding real properties .By way of identifying the characteristics of the urban green area, and incorporating them with other characteristics of a real property as explanatory variables, we can build a hedonic price model for real properties and find out the hedonic prices of urban green area characteristics. The purposes of this study are to measure and evaluate the impact and benefit of the urban area amenity by hedonic price method with geography information system (GIS) survey research. We choose the urban planning district in Lou-dong as the study subject in which the urban green area is defined to be parks and schools. The sample is the real property transactions in 2004. By building one general model and two interaction models, and performing F-test and t-test with the data from the three models, it is proved that the interaction variables of the urban green area characteristics are useful for explaining. Traditionally, most of the literatures use hedonic price method to estimate the housing price with several independent variables. But they neglect the varying parameter effects of the interaction variable. The hedonic price model is estimated by using the housing transaction data and the total green area within a 500 meter radius surrounding the house and the total green area within the urban planning district. The estimated hedonic regression model is then used to estimate the benefits of the green area and to simulate the benefits of various distributions of the additional green area in Lou-dong. By applying the hedonic prices models for urban green area, as a kind of public goods, the benefits of the urban green area will capitalize into the prices of the surrounding real properties, the values of urban green area can be evaluated.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=12,22,2007,Survey Research - Method and Application
Response Effects of Question Order and Response Options in Knowledge Scales,"Su-Hao Tu, Pei-Shan Liao","Question Order,Response Option,Knowledge Scales,Response Effect","Two waves of Taiwan Genomic Survey, collected in 2004 and 2005, contained a battery of items related to knowledge of biotechnology. The main differences between two versions of knowledge questions are question order and response options. Prior to comparing general knowledge level toward biotechnology between two time-points, it is in need to examine whether different question order and response options would cause unstable reliability in the knowledge scale across surrey. In this article, we first examined order effects by comparing the distribution of response to each knowledge item. Meta analysis revealed a significant carry –over effect and the buffer of carry-over effect on few items in the scale. Such kinds of question-order effects were associated with age group. The effect of education on question –order effect was, however, not consistent with theoretical hypothesis. We then examined whether there is significant difference in response style between the two versions of response options by using Latent Class Models –LC-cluster. Age and education were two variables significantly differentiate response style. The present findings indicate the importance of reducing measurement errors and suggest that ”not sure” response in knowledge scale is to distinguish the respondent’s knowledge status.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=11,22,2007,Survey Research - Method and Application

The Typology of Townships in Taiwan:The Analysis of Sampling Stratification of the 2005-2006“Taiwan Social Change Survey”,"Pei-Chun Hou, Su-Hao Tu, Pei-shan Liao, Yung-Tai Hung, Ying-Hwa Chang","development of township, cluster analysis, sampling design, efficiency of stratification","Lou’s (1992) typology of seven strata from 309 townships has been adopted in the “Taiwan Social Change Survey” for a long time. In response to dramatic changes in socio-demographics in the past decade, however, such a typology no longer represents the differences among boroughs and townships nowadays. This paper employs updated socio-economic data derived from both the 2000 census and 2004 population statistics for stratification. A total of 358 boroughs and townships were regrouped into seven strata. The ”Taiwan Social Change Survey” has first adopted this new typology as the stratification for sampling design in 2005. For the management of field work, the sixth and the seventh stratum were finally combined, resulting in six strata as the sampling scheme. To investigate the efficiency of this stratification, this paper combined and analyzed four datasets from the “Taiwan Social Change Survey” conducted in 2005 and 2006. Socio demographic variables, including age, education, industrial structure, occupation, and personal income, were highly related to various levels of development among boroughs and townships and were, therefore, used to test the differences among strata. The results of chi-square test and ANOVA show that all socio-demographic variable are statistically significant, indicating that the differences among these six embedded strata are substantial and as expected as well .",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=8,23,2008,Survey Research - Method and Application

We draw data and experience from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)conducted in the University of Michigan. In 1997, partly because of budget constraints and partly because of an interest in extending the PSID into new content areas, the study switched to biennial data collection from the annual data collection carried out since the beginning of the survey in 1968.After the change, there was a great interest in preserving a few core economic measures for the calendar year(CY) two years prior to the survey year(SY) in a addition to the traditional “prior CY”income data. The CY data two years prior have come to be referred to as ‘t-2’ measures and the measures from one year prior have come to be referred to as ‘t-1’ measures. Since 1999, five waves of ‘t-2’ income data have been collected. This paper documents the quality of these ‘t-2’data in order to evaluate the feasibility of colleting household income data two years later in a survey. Our analyses provide comparisons of income distributions and annual changes in income during the period when PSID interview was conducted annually versus when the PSID interview was collected every other year. We examine total family income, family head’s and spouse’s labor income ,family asses income ,and several other components of the transfer income including public assistance, SSI(Supplementary Security Income), Social Security, and income from other sources such as Veteran Administrations, unemployment compensation, worker’s compensation, and pension. We discuss in which ‘t-2’ income data may provide reasonably accurate estimates and situation in which there may be large reporting errors.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=7,23,2008,Survey Research - Method and Application

The Relationship of Interview Quality with Interview Order and Interview Pace,Meng-Li Yang,"interview quality, interview order, interview pace, nonsubstantive answers, respondent attitude","Experienced interviewers often have higher response rates than novice interviewers and thus are valued by survey organizations. Nonetheless, studies found that experienced interviewers did not necessarily have better data quality. Even worse, both data quality and interview quality became worse as the interviewer gained more experience during the field period. Other research found that later interviews had a quicker pace than earlier interviews. However, even though survey experts have advised interviewers slow down their pace, no research has attempted to examine if it is the interview order or the interview pace, or both, that are related to interview quality. This paper investigates the issue by analyzing the two data files of 2002 Taiwan Social Change Survey with HLM models. I use respondent attitudes when being interviewed and counts of non-substantive answers as two indicators of interview quality. The results suggest that, when the questionnaire contents are closely related to the respondents’ life experience, both interview pace and interview order are independently related to the number of non-substantive answers.

The results demonstrated that post-material values in Taiwan changed from 1985 to 2005. The urban group showed more tendency toward post-material values than the town group and village group did early in this period, however, there was no significant difference of post-material values between the urban and town groups late in the period. Second, this study used two-way ANOVA to further analyze how the two factors, income and urban attributes, influenced the values. The data analysis shows that there is an interaction between urban attributes and income in 2005, but this is not found for 1995. It is suggested that an interaction between urban attributes and income does exist, but is unstable.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=134,27,2012,Survey Research - Method and Application
A Simulation Study of a Continuous Searching Model of Two Mate-Selection Patterns,"Jung-Fu Chang,Tsung-Wen Chang","mate selection,extradyadic dating,mating strategy,prisoner’s dilemma,simulation match","There have been two approaches to simulation mate-selection research. One has focused on one agent’s continuous searching in multiple periods (e.g., Mosteller, 1965, Ferguson, 1989). The other has focused on multi-agent matching in a marriage market in the same period (e.g., Gale and Shapley, 1962). The current study combines these two approaches in a new model. Using the new multi-agent continuous- searching simulation match model, this study simulates the following two mating strategies. A “one-mate dating strategy” (OMS) means dating with one mate while searching for another, better one. An “extra-dyadic dating strategy” (EDS) means secretly dating with two mates at the same time while searching for a better one. In a tenperiod limited searching situation, after 100 simulation iterations in the new model, the results show that the success rate of mating in an “OMS society” (with everyone applying OMS) is higher than in an “EDS society”. This phenomenon is called “a fallacy of composition in mate-selection”. EDS is a more unfaithful strategy than OMS, and EDS looks like a better strategy if others are applying OMS. However, in a marriage market when every individual applies EDS in mating, the results become worse. We suggest that this fallacy can be explained by the prisoner’s dilemma of game theory.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=135,27,2012,Survey Research - Method and Application
Social Distance and Response Styles in Balanced Attitudinal Scales,Su-Hao Tu,"response bias,response style, balanced scale,response effect,social distance","In order to explore the extent to which response styles reduce the reliability and validity of attitudinal scales, this article compares three types of response styles including extreme response, middle response, and acquiescence, and their associations with the characteristics of the respondent and the interviewer, social distance and interview situation between fully balanced and minimally balanced scales. Five-point agreement scales across different contents in a questionnaire collected from a face-to-face survey were employed as the example. Data analyzed is from the Taiwan Social Change Survey concerning national identity. A paired-samples t test indicated that response styles are more frequent in minimally balanced scales than in fully balanced scales. Two-level Hierarchical Poisson and Linear Regression Models showed that response styles are significantly affected by social distances. Extreme response is influenced by gender, marital status, education and age distances, while middle response is affected by gender, marital status and age distances. Marital status and age distances influence the tendency to acquiesce. The social-distance effects on extreme and middle response are more significant in minimally balanced scales than in fully balanced scales. Similar results were not found on acquiescence. Although minimally balanced scales can detect response styles, fully balanced scales are recommended due to less response bias in comparison with minimally balanced scales.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=136,27,2012,Survey Research - Method and Application
Cognitive Autonomy in Adolescence: A Cross-Cultural Comparison of American and Taiwanese High School Students,"Troy E. Beckert ,Chien-Ti Lee ,J.

The current study provides insight on cognitive autonomy from two cultural perspectives. Adolescents from the United States (n = 330) and Taiwan (n = 376) completed the Cognitive Autonomy and Self-Evaluation (CASE) inventory, designed to assess five domains of cognitive autonomy. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) resulted in a two-class model of cognitive autonomy development across both culture and gender. Taiwanese females and males were less likely to self-rate high in cognitive autonomy areas including voicing opinions and self-assessing whereas American youth had lower probabilities to be highly autonomous in evaluating thinking. Adolescents from both cultures self- rated lower in comparative validation. Gender differences were observed among Taiwanese youth but not Americans.

"Climate Change, Public Awareness and Pro-environmental Behaviors: An Empirical Test of the Giddens’s Paradox","Yi-Jen Shih, Wen-Shan Yang","Giddens’s paradox, climate change,environmental behavior, temporal discounts, environmental public goods","How to respond to climate change and its adverse effects has become one of the most important international environmental issues since the 1980s. Anthony Giddens argues that most democratic countries face the challenges of the so-called Giddens’s Paradox when it comes to climate policy decision-making. In other words, the public awareness of climate change does not reflect their behaviors, therefore it is not ideal to be used as a reference for making policies related to climate change. This study aims to explore the relationship between the elements of Giddens’s Paradox, particularly climate risks, environmental public goods and temporal discounts, and Taiwanese respondents’ environmental behaviors. The data from the Taiwan Social Change Survey 2010 round 6 Environment Module’s dataset is used in this analysis. Findings show that these three elements of Gidden’s Paradox have different influence on pro-environmental behaviors. The element of climate risks tend to only affect respondents in terms of their willingness to pay higher prices for commodities, while public goods and temporal discounts increase people’s willingness to pay higher commodity prices and higher taxes and accept cuts in the standard of living to avoid environmental degradation.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=244,28,2012,Survey Research - Method and Application
Survey Response in the Presence of Others: An Analysis of Social Normative and Sensitive Questions,Su-Hao Tu,"response quality, response tendency, the third-party effect, the presence of third-parties, interview place","The assurance of confidentiality in a dyad interview (private interview) is central to survey interviewing, and it is a premise of such interviewing. In reality, however, the presence of third-parties, a situational variable in the interview, is hard to avoid. Despite the mixed results found in previous studies (Blair, 1979, Hartmann, 1995), some findings were supportive of a significant third-party effect, especially those with a high degree of sensitivity and social norms (Taietz, 1962, Aquilino, 1993, Smith, 1997). Furthermore, scant attention has been paid to the in-depth nature of the presence of others. Three dimensions of the presence of others, respectively the number of others, the types of others and the duration of their presence, were examined in this study under the assumption that they would lead the respondents to underreport or to provide socially desirable answers to sensitive or social normative questions, as seen in comparison with factual questions. Data from a regional survey of metropolitan residents aged 20 or older in Taiwan were used. The results indicated that 50–60% of interviews carried out when third-parties were present, mostly one person. About 40% of third-parties were present all the time. Concerning personal income and sexual experience, in contrast to bias-reduced substantial responses, biased responses are more likely to occur in the interviews characterized by one to three dimensions of third-party presence. In terms of response tendency, significant third-party effects were found among substantial responses and bias-reduced substantial responses to the questions including cohabitation, extra-marital relations, abortion, unmarried women, personal income, and political-party identification. In particular, the third-party effect on biased response to personal income was consistently found significant across three dimensions of the presence of others. The present findings reconfirm the theoretical expectations for the third-party effect on response quality and response tendency to social normative and sensitive questions. They also echo what the previous studies have indicated: the situational effect varies with questions of different nature.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=245,28,2012,Survey Research - Method and Application
Friends and Delinquency: Is Deviant Peer Influence Real?,Man-Kit Lei,"deviant peers, delinquency, influence effect, selection effect, projection effect","Consistently, empirical findings have indicated that the presence of deviant peers is one of the strongest predictors of adolescent delinquency. While this association is widely accepted, the mechanisms at work have been disputed. Two competing approaches, the influence and selection approaches, have received the most scholarly attention. The influence model argues that an association with deviant peers has a real and causal impact on adolescent delinquency. Conversely, the selection model posits that perceived associations are the result of homophily, as people tend to form or select friendships with others who share similar characteristics. Using a sample of 2,280 Taiwanese  adolescents from the Taiwan Youth Project along with friendship network data, this study reexamines the association between deviant peers and delinquency. In order to rule out potential biases, this study uses both perceptual and direct measures of deviant peers. The perceptual measure of deviant peers refers to an individual’s report of his or her friends’ delinquent behavior, whereas the direct measure is formed through an analysis of the friendship network data. Controlling for selection and projection effects, the results show that the effect of deviant peers on delinquency remains significant. The results also indicate that using a self-report measure of deviant peers, in contrast to a social network analysis, potentially overestimates the deviant peers-delinquency relationship. Finally, this study’s results support the combined use of both self-report measures of deviant peers in conjunction with self-control and parental monitoring measures to best account for the influence of deviant friendships on delinquency.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=246,28,2012,Survey Research - Method and Application

RS (stratified random sampling) and PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling procedures were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of multi-level primary sampling units on population inference in social science research. When a social science survey has complexly designed sampling frames, the Str. RS and PPS are often applied. However, the effects of different sampling weights within these two methods on the inference of population characteristics are often neglected. A numerical simulation study and a real data analysis on Taiwan Social Change Survey data with a further extension confirmatory factor analysis model based on Yang and Tsai (2008) were proposed in this study. Independent variables manipulated in this study include the sampling designs, data type (continuous or categorical), sampling size, and heterogeneity of PSU. The results suggest the PPS sampling design can provide a more precise parameter estimate of CFA models in a complexly designed sampling frame survey, whether the data type is continuous or categorical.

It also has high credibility and reference value. For the measurement of sensitive issues or social moral issues, however, its validity has often been questioned. Evidence-based investigations of public opinion polls are few. The nature of election bribery is a sensitive issue as well as a social moral issue. Additionally, Taiwan has also been strengthening the inspection of election bribery recently. Thus, it is worthwhile to examine the consistency and divergence of information on election bribery among public opinion polls, media reports and official statistics.

Do Consumers Really Care about Biodiversity? Large Scale Choice-Experimental Evidence of Genetically Modified Soymilk in Taiwan,"Feng-An Yang, Hung-Hao Chang","GM soymilk, willingness to pay, biodiversity, Taiwan","Although there is no lack of empirical evidence on the determinants of genetically modified (GM) food purchase behavior, most of the available studies focus on the effects of market price and individual socio-economic characteristics. Far less is known about whether consumers will respond to environmental protection in their purchase decisions. This paper contributes to an enormous body of literature on the demand for GM food by taking biodiversity protection into account. In particular, we investigate a trade-off between consumers’ willingness to pay and the conservation of biodiversity. Using a large scale choice-experimental survey dataset of 1,188 individuals, drawn from the Taiwan Genomic Survey conducted in 2011, we estimate a sequential logit model for the sequential decision making process. Our results show that demand for GM food is not simply determined by market price, but is also highly correlated with consumers’ awareness of biodiversity conservation. Consumers would be less likely to purchase GM soymilk if the GM production process damages the environment. Moreover, the trade-off between market prices and conservation of biodiversity is found to be non-linear.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=249,29,2013,Survey Research - Method and Application

Interview Style and Response Quality,Su-Hao Tu,"Interview Style, Standardized Interview, Flexible Interview, Interviewer Feedback, Response Quality","Standardized interview has been adopted for several decades to reduce response bias derived from interviewer-related errors. There has been debate over the extent to which standardized interview can be flexible in the literature. The feasibility of flexible interview is still uncertain due to the difficulty of observing interview interaction which is mostly dependent on the interviewer. While previous studies have not come to any conclusion, there is none of the related study in Taiwan. This study takes interviewer feedback regulated in standardized telephone interview as an example to examine whether flexible feedback behavior can improve response quality among factual, social desirable and personal sensitive questions. The results integrate quantitative data with qualitative data show that the percentage of invalid response is lower in the interview with flexible feedback than that in standardized interview but opposite trend was found in response bias. Two-level Hierarchical Poisson Regression Model shows that interview style exerts no significant effect of on the occurrence of invalid response to social desirable and personal sensitive questions but significantly influences whether response bias repeatedly occurs on the attitudes toward marriage. The chance of having response bias is higher in flexible interview than that in standardized interview. The present findings are similar to previous findings on more response bias in personal interview than in standardized interview but deviant from the results based on the same design of experiment in the previous studies.

The mediating variables such as perceived risk and perceived benefit play vital role in explaining the influences of consumer attitudes toward nature and environment, knowledge in genomic technology, and trusts to institutions and governments on the acceptance of genetically modified products.

The situation is getting worse because of the increasing usage of cellphones, hence raising public doubt about the inferences made from traditional telephone surveys. This study uses three largescale survey databases to investigate the issues involved, namely, the2009–10 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), the 2009 Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System Telephone Survey, and the 2009 Adult Smoking Behavior Telephone Survey. Four types of telephone usage, i.e., line phone with cellphone, line phone without cellphone, cellphone-only, and neither line phone nor cellphone, assessed from the NHIS face-to-face interviews, are used for the estimations of inference bias caused by the coverage deficiency of traditional telephone interviews. The results show that among adults aged 18 and above, 9.3% of the sample interviewed belonged to the cellphone-only group. This does show some effect on traditional telephone survey coverage, but the problem is not serious. The study uses adult smoking rate as an indicator to demonstrate the fact that a weighting scheme is a necessity to correct the bias caused by coverage and nonresponse problems for traditional landline telephone surveys.

The main purpose of this study is to investigate the association between implementation of the rural regeneration program (RRP) and community life satisfaction of rural residents. This study used data of the Rural Subjective Well- Being Competitiveness survey, which was conducted by the Council of Agriculture, including 1,588 rural respondents. Several multiple regression models were employed to estimate the treatment and spillover effect of participating in the rural regeneration program on community life satisfaction. The results show that participation in the RRP is positively associated with the level of community life satisfaction. In addition to treatment effect of the RRP, several spillover effects are also evident in different dimensions of community life satisfaction. Those who lived in the RRP community but did not participate in the RRP-related training courses were more satisfied with their community development, compared with the non-RRP community residents. Consequently, this study suggests that the agricultural authority could strengthen advanced training courses for the RRP community, and encourage the non-RRP community residents to participate in existing RRP-related training programs.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=259,32,2014,Survey Research - Method and Application
Analysis of Farmers’ Acceptance of the Fallow Land Subsidy Policy,"Yu-Hui Chen, Man-Ser Jan, Ya-Hui Chen","Fallow Land Subsidy, Farmland Lease, Acceptance","In recent years, Taiwan’s agricultural authorities have adopted numerous agricultural policies to adjust the production scale, rejuvenate the labor force and increase farmers’ income, such as guaranteedprice purchasing of rice, a fallow land subsidy, land diversion program, contract farming award, elderly farmer pension, assistance for production and distribution, farmland bank (farmland lease), small-landowners big-tenants program, fallow land reactivation program, wandervogel and gardeners plan, farmers’ school etc. However, the effectiveness of agricultural policies and farmers’ satisfaction with them have rarely been discussed in the literature. This study attempts to use a face to face questionnaire survey to measure the effectiveness of the agricultural policies from the viewpoints of farmers’ willingness to participate and their satisfaction. Special attention is paid both to finding significant factors that affect the farmers’ willingness to participate in the fallow land subsidy policy and to measuring farmers’ willingness to accept the farmland lease program. The empirical results show that, on average, farmers are satisfied with the agricultural subsidies program. The small-landowners big-tenants program has the highest satisfaction score, and the guaranteed-price purchasing program for rice has the lowest satisfaction score. In addition, farmers who live in northern, central and southern Taiwan, are over 65 years old, and have low family income have higher probability of participation in the set-aside subsidy program. Those farmers with a university degree or above, or higher agriculture/household income ratio have lower willingness to participate in the fallow land subsidies program. On the assessment of farmland lease policy, farmers living in central or southern Taiwan, males, those with total cultivated area of more than 4 hectares, or who received more government subsidies, are more willing to lease farmland, farmers over 71 years old, who farm total area of 1 hectare or less, or who have inherited their farmland are less willing to lease farmland.

A Feasible Mechanism for Regional Agriculture in Taiwan:,"I Han, Min-Hsien Yang","regional agriculture, feasible mechanism, Yun-Cha-Nan region","This research aims to explore the policy positioning of regional agriculture and feasible execution mechanisms for a long-term sustainable approach in the context of agricultural development in the Yun- Cha-Nan region in Taiwan. This research defines regional agriculture as “an integration of natural and human resources by geographic proximity, where clustered agricultural activities are connected to gain competitive advantages against other regions.” Regionalization of agriculture facilitates utilization and sharing of local agricultural resources, minimizes within- and cross-region transaction costs, and establishes regional agricultural reputations as an identity. By using both qualitative fieldwork and quantitative survey approaches, we interviewed 24 (agri-)businesses and collected 250 farmer-survey samples to formulate our arguments. A two-way, top-down and bottom-up approach should be the ideal mechanism for regional agriculture. The top authority level of the central government should focus on information platforms, standardization, and national land planning in the agricultural sector. Regional offices as suggested should play roles in communication and coordination across central-local and local-local governments as well as within the region. Local government should conduct security inspections and search for common regional interests. The middle market level of agribusinesses execute daily security inspections, connect value-added activities, and integrate inter-disciplinary technology and marketing. The bottom level of farmers should maximize scale economies through organizing and branding across local-bounded territories. It is highly recommended that our policy maker choose the most feasible and powerful steps to leverage resources for the benefit of agribusiness and organized farmers.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=261,32,2014,Survey Research - Method and Application

To fill the gap, we apply a two-stage model to explore the factors that determine tobacco farmers’ willingness-to-accept (WTA) value to forfeit their contracts on growing tobacco. The results from a first-step Probit model suggest that farmers who are optimistic toward the future of the tobacco industry are less likely to sell their contracts, and large farmers, in terms of scale of cultivation, are less willing to give up their farming contracts. The second stage of our analysis relies on a two-stage least squares model. We find that WTA value is positively associated with actual farming practices, and higher previous contract trading prices lead to a higher WTA value. Consistent with the rationale in the first stage, we also find that optimism regarding the future of the tobacco industry leads to a higher WTA price.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=262,32,2014,Survey Research - Method and Application

This study aims to analyze the impact of the increases in both gasoline and electricity prices on the agricultural sector in Taiwan, and to see the policy effect of energy subsidies as well. Energy input data based on a Council of Agricultural (COA) report and energy consumption data based on a survey conducted by the Bureau of Energy (BOE) are used to explore the energy input cost of the agricultural sector (including the crop sector and livestock sector), and are further used for policy simulation with Taiwan’s agricultural policy simulation system (TWAPS). The simulation results show that increases in both gasoline and electricity prices would have negative impact on industries with high energy input, such as the flower and dairy cow industries. Energy subsidy measures might slightly reduce the impact from gasoline and electricity price increases and further stabilize consumer prices, but the policy effect would not be significant. Moreover, study results also indicate that the impact from increasing energy prices on the agricultural sector would be increased by greater development of greenhouse farming.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=266,33,2015,Survey Research - Method and Application
Evaluation of the rural tourism recreation value of Sinpu,"Wen-Hui Ho, Ya-Wen Chiueh","rural tourism, leisure benefit, travel cost method, analytic hierarchy process, contingent behavior","Recently, simple, natural, and relaxing rural tourism has gradually attracted more and more tourists in Taiwan. Sinpu is a small Hakka town with a beautiful landscape, unique delicacies, and distinctive traditional family shrines and clan temples. If its rich resources can be integrated with the local culture to develop rural tourism, additional value can be added to the local resources. This can therefore bring in huge tourism income and benefits. This study uses the travel cost method (TCM) to evaluate the overall leisure benefits of Sinpu’s leisure resources. TCM cannot directly evaluate the leisure benefits of a single location with multiple purposes. Therefore, TCM is combined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to evaluate the leisure benefits of Sinpu’s three leisure resources (i.e. leisure agricultural resources, historical and cultural monuments, and local delicacies). The present study also uses TCM combined with contingent behavior(CB) to evaluate the influences of the many annual festivals and events held on Sinpu’s leisure benefits. As shown in the results, the leisure benefits of tourists’ visiting Sinpu in 2012 were NT$4,254 per person per visit, NT$14,421 per person per year, and NT$532 million in total for a whole year. By AHP calculation, the CS value of leisure agriculture resources is NT$202 million, the CS value of historical and cultural monuments is NT$138 million, and the CS value of local delicacies is NT$191 million. Assuming that there are festivals held in the coming year, the leisure benefit is NT$5,630 per person per visit, NT$23,590 per person per year, and NT$704 million in total for a whole year. Compared to 2012, the CS value increases by 32.3%.

Reexamining the Transformation of I-Lan University's Retail Sales Area into Fair-Organization: A Survey on Consumer Attitudes toward Essential Goods,"Lee-Chen Chen, Bao-Tzuoh Huang, Zhong-Kai Liou","local consuming area, elegant business, fair agglomeration","Due to recent food safety scandals, consumers have become more sophisticated about purchases of convenience. The cross-region tourism has been booming since the Shea-San tunnel opened on National Highway 5. There is a dilemma for the rural retailers in the I-Lan university area in terms of choosing either to base their business upon self-interested or altruistic attitudes, because the tourism industry is prospering. This study aims to survey the area’s arriving purchasers regarding their consumption behavior after being confronted by a sequence of food safety problems. A convenience sample and qualitative choice estimation are adopted to evaluate behavioral reactions in the face of such unfair market conditions. The empirical results of this study demonstrate how to promote the internal transformation of such local zones into ones offering healthy, friendly products amid the distrustful atmosphere.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=268,33,2015,Survey Research - Method and Application
Adjusting Survey Response Distributions Using Multiple Imputation: A Simulation with External Validation,"Frank C.S. Liu, Yu-Sung Su","multiple imputation, item-non-response, missing values, external validation","Item non-response is endemic to most survey studies, and hinders the researcher in making sensible inferences. One plausible solution to this problem, multiple imputation (MI), is becoming a widely used approach in dealing with the problem of missing data thanks to the development of various software packages. Nonetheless, MI is not a panacea. Imputing missing data using MI without checking it may further induce biases. This oblivious use of MI arises partly from the conviction that some MI assumptions are simply mathematically unverifiable. Hence, the goal of the paper is twofold: first, it demonstrates how various post-MI diagnostics can be performed with a telephone survey dataset collected in Taiwan in early 2013, secondly, it places greater emphasis on the external validity of MI with a followup survey, and compares imputed values to the real ones. This paper concludes that, with a sensible application of MI and accompanying diagnostics, we are able to adjust survey response distribution and, at the same time, elaborate on the inferences in our studies.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=269,34,2015,Survey Research - Method and Application
New Challenges and Inspirations for Future Telephone Survey Research in Taiwan: The Cell-Phone-Only Factor,,"coverage, accessibility, cell-phone-only, voter turnout rate","The proportion of adults with cell-phone-only (CPO) is growing rapidly. The traditional telephone survey sampling frame has serious coverage bias. Using 2012 and 2013 data from the Taiwan Election and Democratization Survey (TEDS), this article is among the first to reveal that non-coverage can result in non-negligible bias for traditional landline telephone surveys that do not cover cell phones. We selected TEDS responses obtained from cell phone calls, and found that 6.2% of the total population older than 20 years old is the cellphone-only (CPO) group. The estimation bias varies between plus and minus 0.93%, depending on the characteristics of the variables and the population, and their political propensity. This study uses voter turnout rate as the reference for comparison. The results show that weighted estimation improves the bias in the traditional telephone survey. With the results of this paper, we would like to suggest that Taiwan should be ready to launch an exploratory study investigating surveying by cell phone. Although cell phone surveys are still very expensive and not cost-effective, there is consensus among researchers that sampling and weighting methods for cell phone surveys should be further developed.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=270,34,2015,Survey Research - Method and Application

The Effect of Socio-economic Status on Environmental Behavior in Taiwan,"Yu-An Chen, Yeu-Sheng Hsieh","environmental behavior, socioeconomic status, economic status, social status, threshold effect","This article explores the environmental behavior patterns of Taiwanese and their characteristics. It also examines the association between SES and environmental behavior, and compares the differences in the effects between economic status and social status. It finally investigates whether there is a threshold effect of economic status or social status on environmental behavior. The analyzed data are from the Taiwan Social Change Survey in 2010 by the Institute of Sociology of Academia Sinica, Taiwan. Latent class models are utilized to identify latent types of environmental behavior, and multinomial logit regression and spline regression are applied to examine the effects of socioeconomic status on types of environmental behavior. Results suggest that individuals are divided into three types: regulated or normative environmental behavior (41.5%), individual environmental behavior (44.3%) and comprehensive environmental behavior (14.3%). Although overall SES has a significant effect on environmental behavior, only social status shows a significant effect on environmental behavior. Finally, the authors find support for the significant threshold effect of economic status on environmental behavior in which people with low economic status are more likely to engage in individual-type environmental behavior whereas people with high economic status are unexpectedly more likely to practice regulated or normative-type environmental behavior.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=273,35,2016,Survey Research - Method and Application
Sexual Orientation of Youth at Early Adulthood Stage in Taiwan: Research Results from Taiwan Youth Research Project,"Wen-Shan Yang, Yi-Fang Lee","homosexuality, bisexuals, quantitative studies, Taiwan Youth Project","In Taiwan there are a limited number of quantitative studies of homosexuality and homosexual practices in the research literature. The scarcity of such research has led to confusion in the public discourse on homosexuality and civil right issues regarding same-sex marriage legislation in recent years. In 2011, the Taiwan Youth Project conducted by the Institute of Sociology at Academia Sinica deployed a self-administered questionnaire to examine sexual inclination and practices from a cohort of 24- to 29-year-old adults in northern Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to utilize the 2011 Taiwan Youth Project data to estimate the proportion of homosexuals and non-heterosexuals among the respondents, based on three dimensions of sexual orientation, namely desire, behavior, and identity. The research findings show that there are approximately 2.85 percent male homosexuals and 5.21 percent female homosexuals among the population of 24- to 29-year-old adults in northern Taiwan. Our results resonate with existing studies showing that females in early adulthood have a stronger inclination toward homosexuality in terms of these three dimensions of sexuality. In addition, there are approximately 8.86 percent male non-heterosexuals and 27.65 percent female non-heterosexuals among the population of 24- to 29-year-old adults in northern Taiwan. However, although 8 percent of female respon-dents expressed bisexual desire, only a few are involved in actual bisexual relationships or behavior.

Application of the Randomized Response Technique in the 2012 Presidential Election of Taiwan,"Shu-Hui Hsieh, Su-Hao Tu, Shen-Ming Lee, Chain-Wen Wang","Randomized response technique, Randomized Response Technique in Multiple Categories, sensitive question, presidential election","Direct inquiry in social surveys of sensitive questions such as personal privacy or illegal behaviors often encounters refusal or untrue response. In order to collect reliable sensitive data, reduce the unwillingness of respondents, and reduce bias in estimation, Randomized Response Technique (RRT) is one of the important methods. RRT has been commonly used to avoid biased answers in surveys on sensitive issues by ensuring respondents’ privacy, but are rarely adopted in faceto- face interview surveys in Taiwan, except for Yang (1994) in his study estimating election bribery by using the unrelated question RRT of Greenberg et al.

Mode Effects on Response Design: An Example of Qualify-of-Life Measures,Pei-Shan Liao,"mode effect, mid-point response, response labels, quality of life","Questionnaire design often differs among various survey modes in order to obtain better data quality. Previous studies have indicated that a higher number of response categories may perform better in face-to-face surveys than in telephone surveys. Few have examined the influence of response labels and unbalanced scale design on survey answers. This study aims to compare the responses between faceto- face and telephone surveys with respect to response design of attitudinal scales. Data used for this study are drawn from the 2010 Taiwan Social Change Survey and telephone surveys collected in 2010 and 2011 using a randomized experimental design to collect data from representative samples aged 18 years or older. By measuring the construct of individual quality of life (QoL), four types of response scales with different combinations of response number and response labels were examined to distinguish both the intensity and direction of responses. Individual characteristics between the two modes indicated that the sub-samples were different in terms of monthly income and working status. Results of the graded response model suggested that the response design used in this study performed better in face-to-face surveys than in telephone surveys. Also, a balanced scale with four response categories and less intense labels had the best discriminating ability among the four designs. When compared to respondents to telephone surveys, respondents to face-to-face surveys were less likely to provide strongly-labeled answers, which can be seen a tendency of social desirability due to more interpersonal interactions. Findings of linear regression on the IRT scores of QoL, however, were in favor of telephone surveys, with higher values of chi-square. An intertwining effect of response design and data collection mode was also found.

Results were obtained through a questionnaire survey, which was completed by upper-level management and the directors-general of the FA’s. Through these means, primary materials were gathered regarding the output weights in all areas of operating performance, the repartition of capital, and the sources of non-performing loans. Analysis on the hierarchy efficiency of the 172 FA’s and their four subordinate departments was conducted for data from 2010 through 2011. The output indicator was obtained through the AR-DEA model and expanded into the Metafrontier model. Correlations between the operating efficiency of the FA’s and the personality traits of their directors-general, numbers of awards, evaluations, years of service and other experience were analyzed. The empirical results show that the credit departments of the urban FA’s generally demonstrate better efficiency and production performance, whereas the three other departments demonstrate better performance in rural FA’s and mixed FA’s. In respect to FA’s on the whole, mixed FA’s show superior efficiency, followed by the rural FA’s and urban FA’s. Regression results indicate that a director-general’s personality traits exert influence on efficiency,whilst the number of awards, evaluations, and years of service also display a close relationship with operating efficiency and production performance of such associations.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=278,36,2016,Survey Research - Method and Application

The survey was the first ever large-scale survey in Taiwan to investigate Taiwanese citizens’ reaction towards “justiciable problems”, how the reaction affected their actions taken, and finally, what the consequences of these actions are. Although the basic design of the questionnaire was similar to past surveys in other countries, which gathered information on the whole process and the results of disputes, the survey also investigated one aspect that had often been ignored in the past, namely, the legal consciousness of the respondents. Incorporating legal consciousness into the questionnaire enables us to investigate how people’s legal consciousness affects their attitudes and actions toward disputes and, conversely, how the people’s experience in disputes affects their attitudes toward the legal system.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=279,36,2016,Survey Research - Method and Application
A Study of the Relationship between Media Marketing and Tourism Satisfaction: Using Inbound Visitors to Taiwan as a Case Study,"Yu-Peng Chen, Chih-Chun Chen, Chun-Ya Hsu, Feng-Jeng Lin","foreign tourists, media marketing, tourism attraction, tourism satisfaction","In this paper, a causal model linking three factors (media marketing, tourism attraction and tourism satisfaction) was proposed and validated. Through an in-depth multi-group analysis, the study also investigated whether groups with different tourist characteristics and travel characteristics would have moderating effects on this causal model. Furthermore, quantile regression models were hired to explore the effects and influences of explanatory variables on different quantiles of tourism attraction and tourism satisfaction. The final results show that: (1) The causal model has goodness of fit and explanatory abilities. (2) Media marketing significantly affected tourism attraction for inbound visitors to Taiwan. Moreover, media marketing had a powerful effect on each quantile of tourism attraction. (3) Although tourism attraction significantly affected the tourism satisfaction for inbound visitors to Taiwan, the influential effect declined for visitors with higher satisfaction. Due to this failure to meet the interests of visitors with higher satisfaction, the issue of whether creating more artificial attractions could result in disguising their original natural outlook should be considered. (4) Media marketing could also effectively and positively promote tourism satisfaction, yet, the effect would not appear for visitors with higher satisfaction. The paper concludes by suggesting a promotion of media marketing that considers improving the dynamic advertisements on Taiwan and providing more practical tourism information to visitors.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=280,36,2016,Survey Research - Method and Application
The Willingness to Pay of Environmental Pollution Insurance: An Empirical Study of CPC Franchised Gas Stations,"Jen-Jen Tseng, Powen Yeh, Ping-Hung Chou","environmental pollution insurance, willingness to pay, premium, risk perception, environmental management","In order to promote an environmental pollution insurance system, the first thing is to understand the demand from potential consumers. The demand for insurance is determined by the subjective perception of environmental risk and the involvement in environmental management by companies. In addition, consumers have a subjective value for the price of environmental pollution insurance, which is then turned into a monetary form as the willingness to pay. This study attempts to explore the relationship among the risk perception of pollution, environmental management involvement, and willingness to pay of potential polluters. Empirically, the study chooses CPC-franchised gas stations as research targets, and 302 valid questionnaires were recovered. Under the assumed insurance condition, research results indicate that the willingness to pay using a singlebound dichotomous choice model is NTD 92,466 and NTD 92,159 as estimated by probit and logit models, respectively. The willingness to pay is between NTD 93,025 and NTD 96,761 using a doubled-bound dichotomous choice model.

Forecasting Hierarchical Time Series by Using Combined Forecasts,"Feng-Jeng Lin, Ming-Ren Kang","Hierarchical Forecasting, Combined Forecasting, Independent Component Analysis, Whitening","This paper examines a process that integrates the concept of combined forecast with the eigenvalue proportions resulted from the matrix formed by whitening of independent component analysis (ICA) as applied to forecast time series data with a hierarchical mode. In this process, the stage of combined forecast will be executed twice. The first stage will combine the several forecasts that derive from different forecasting methods, whereas the second stage will combine the forecasts that operate in a top-down and bottom-up manner. To evaluate and compare the reliability and applicability of the proposed process as practiced on time series data with a hierarchical mode, the official monthly number of inbound tourists to Taiwan, as obtained from the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), will be used in this paper. Meanwhile, three combining methods (arithmetic average, variance-weighted, ICA-weighted) will also be adopted to assess their forecasting performance. As a result, we will note three important findings in this empirical study: (1) Although the forecasting performance is very inconsistent in each forecasting method, some correct signals are all required, therefore, using a combined forecast to integrate these correct signals is an optimal alternative. (2) The ICAweighted method can decrease the error signals and be more efficient in integrating correct signals in the first combining stage. (3) The ICAweighted method still outperformed the other two combining methods in the second combining stage. In summary, the findings demonstrate that the proposed forecasting process is feasible and reliable. The results suggest the possibility of applying forecast of hierarchical time series data to other areas as well.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=282,37,2017,Survey Research - Method and Application

Determinants of Political Participation in Taiwan: From A Viewpoint of Citizenship Norms,"Eric Chen-hua Yu, Ting-wei Weng","political participation, citizenship norms, cultural model, social structure model, attitudinal model","Why do citizens participate in politics? This study utilizes two waves of survey datasets in 2004 and 2014, respectively, and focuses on the extent to which citizenship norms (i.e., perceptions of “good” citizenship) affect political participation. Specifically, this study combines different explanatory approaches and analyzes why political participation has changed over the ten-year period of time. By adopting Dalton’s (2008, 2009) theoretical framework that divides citizenship norms into two dimensions—namely, duty-based citizenship norms and engaged citizenship norms, our findings regarding the linkages between norm perceptions and participation behaviors are threefold: first, the perception of engaged citizenship norms may have a significant impact on active political participation, second, the perception of duty-based citizenship norms may affect voting behavior, and third, neither type of citizenship norm has any impact on affiliation with political parties. Additionally, we further utilize a counterfactual analysis to dissect different components that may have caused the change in political participation from 2004 to 2014. We found that over the period of time, the changes in active participation as well as party affiliation have been mainly affected by structural changes of the linkages between political participation and its determinants.

Women’s (No) Naming Right under,"Chao-ju Chen, Yen-wen Peng, Chin-fen Chang","patronymy, matronymic naming, gender and family, legal reform, Taiwan Social Change Survey","Patronymy is the norm by which children’s surnames are based on their fathers’ surnames, and/or wives’ surnames are to follow their husbands’. Taiwan is one of the countries where the practice of patro-nymy prevails. Before 2007, it was legally required that children assume the father’s surname, albeit with some exceptions. In 2007, the legislature passed a milestone amendment of family law that permits parents to decide the surname of the child through mutual agreement, but governmental statistics show that on average only 1.7% of all newborns in the past 9 years took their mother’s surname. Whether people in Taiwan are indeed overwhelmingly dominated by patronymic thinking despite the legal amendment, or there is a disjuncture between people’s attitudes and behavior on nontraditional surnaming as revealed by existing literature, is the main question that we want to probe. Drawing on data from the 2002 and 2012 Taiwan Social Change Survey, we analyze people’s attitudes a decade apart, and the factors that influenced and differentiated people’s attitudes. Based on binomial logistic analysis of the two surveys, we find significant impacts of demographic and socio-economic status on the naming practices in the family. While in general Taiwanese endorsement of patronymy declined after the law passed, men are significantly more likely to support patronymic naming than are women. Respondents with higher education and upper non-manual workers seem to be more flexible in bestowing children’s last names. We also confirm that when people support gender equality and when women are better educated, families are more likely to accept the taking of mothers’ surnames. To change the practice of patronymic surnaming, therefore, we suggest a more radical legal reform approach accompanying continuous feminist activism to empower women and change men’s gender ideology, and to encourage the decision to give children the mother’s surname.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=287,38,2017,Survey Research - Method and Application
Life Course and Cohort Impacts of,Wei-Pang Wang,"Education, Depression, Aging, Cohort","A growing body of literature has demonstrated that the impacts of education on physical health vary across the life course and across birth cohorts in Western societies. However, since aging effects and cohort effects are difficult to disentangle empirically, most previous studies have estimated one effect while ignoring the other. In addition, whether the temporal impacts of education can be extended to depression and whether they exist in non-Western societies are much less known. Thus, this study is conducted to elucidate the patterns between education and depression across the life course and across cohorts in Taiwan, by using age-cohort regression models on the sequential cross-sectional data pooled from the Taiwan Social Change Survey and using latent growth curve models on the longitudinal data obtained from the 1989– 2003 Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan. The main findings are: (1) both approaches consistently indicate a favorable direction of life-course relationship in depression for the well educated within the same cohort. Thus, the age-specific rates of change in depression differ across levels of education in a manner that progressively enlarges the gap in late life, supporting the cumulative advantage hypothesis, (2) the education-based difference in depression is larger and appears earlier for younger cohorts, which is consistent with the rising importance hypothesis, and (3) evidence for the age-as-lever hypothesis appears in the TSCS analyses, but is limited in the latent growth analyses obtained from the elderly panels. The cross-sectional analyses are affected by selective mortality. Thus, the convergence of depression by levels of education in late life may be illusory.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=288,38,2017,Survey Research - Method and Application
Physical and Psychological Toll of Credit Card Debt: An Investigation of the Mediating Pathway,Chih-Yuan Weng,"credit card debt, SES gradient of health, stress process, mediation analysis, indirect effect","Drawing on the abundant literature of ‘SES gradient of health’ and the theoretical framework of ‘stress process’, this study proposes two major research hypotheses: (1) carrying credit card debt has a significant and stronger adverse impact on physical and psychological wellbeing than carrying other types of debt, even after adjusting for socio-demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds, (2) it is more likely for carrying credit card debt to be associated with higher level of physical dysfunction through increase in psychological distress, than to be linked to greater psychological distress via growing physical dysfunction. Findings based on “2007 Taiwan Social Change Survey (Round 5, Year 3): Social Stratification” support both hypotheses. First of all, when debt had nothing do with credit card outstanding balances, it was positively predictive of psychological distress only to a moderate extent, but it was not associated with significant gain in physical dysfunction. However, the debt-health relationship was significant and much stronger in terms of both physical and psychological dimensions when any part of the debt was accrued on credit cards. Secondly, the mediation analyses revealed that debt without credit card outstanding balances was barely related to elevation of physical dysfunction given limited increase in psychological distress. On the contrary, the relative indirect effect of credit card debt on physical dysfunction through psychological distress was both strong and significant (relative to no debt at all as well as other types of debt). Alternative models indicated that the relative indirect effect of credit card debt on psychological distress through physical dysfunction failed to reach statistical significance.

Application of Mokken Scale: An Example of Attitudes toward Language Learning and Use with Longitudinal Data,"Pei-shan Liao, Jeng-Tung Chiang, Ting-Hsiang Lin","Mokken scale, Guttman scale, Item Response Theory, latent trait, language learning","Cumulative scales have been widely used in questionnaires to measure respondents’ latent traits, such as personality or attitudes toward certain events. Different scaling models have been developed to reveal the disparity among respondents, in which Guttman-type scales are commonly used. However, their assumption of a unique combination of response patterns and lack of stochastic implications of the scalagram indices have limited their application to empirical studies. The Mokken scale, which can also be seen as a non-parametric item nonresponse model (NIRT), has been developed to relax the rigid assumptions of the Guttman scale while maintaining its requirements of uni-dimensionality, local independence, and monotonicity. In addition, the Mokken scale takes into account probabilities of responses to question items, which enable the examination of whether these items are measures of the same latent construct. This study describes the basic assumptions and characteristics of the Mokken scale, and demonstrates its application using empirical data. Question items which measure the latent attitudes about language learning and use from 2004-2014 Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS) are used as an example to examine the scalability of the items and the scale that consists of those items. Furthermore, logistic regression of the latent trait using Mokken scale scores on demographic characteristics and a variable associated with language used at home are performed. Our results indicate that the association between the examined variables and the latent trait varies depending on the survey year.

A Bayesian Estimation Study of the Sensitive Character,"Chih-Li Wang, Tai-Da Chen","sensitive question, Randomized Response Model, Bayesian Estimation, stratified sampling, conjugate prior distribution","Many researchers are faced with the problem of estimating the sensitive characteristic proportion π of a human population that has a particular characteristic A. Often reluctant to admit to having this particular characteristic A, respondents may refuse to participate or provide untruthful answers, which causes bias in study results. Stanley Warner first proposed the Randomized Response Model (RRM), which protects the respondent’s privacy while simultaneously increasing both their cooperation in the survey and their willingness to provide an honest answer. However, Warner’s study and related subsequent literature all focus on the application of the maximum likelihood method and ignore the fact that the ratio θ of the respondents’ “yes” response in the model should be restricted within the parameter space [1 − P, P], where P is the probability of the randomized device, resulting in the possibility of the estimated value of π being negative or greater than one. Robert Winkler and Leroy Franklin proposed a Bayesian approach for Warner’s model using a non-conjugate prior Beta distribution for π over [0, 1]. Shaul Bar-Lev et al. (2003) presented a conjugate prior Beta distribution to some RRMs. The aim of this study is to apply the Bayesian approach to the RRM provided by Chih-li Wang and Wangjung Tsai, coupled with a two-stage randomized response model, which uses the concept of stratified randomized response model proposed by Jong-Min Kim and William Warde and suitable truncated Beta distributions in a common conjugate prior structure to obtain the Bayes estimates for the proportion of a “sensitive character A” in the population of interest.

"Marriage Patterns of Indigenous Peoples in Taiwan: Cohort Effect, Generational Heritage and Ethnic Difference","Chien-Chia Liu, Ying-Hwa Chang","intra-marriage, ethnic intermarriage, racial intermarriage, indigenous people","Compared to the spatial segregation period before the 1950s, indigenous people have had migrated from tribal to metropolitan areas since 1970 and had more daily contact with Han Chinese and other ethnic group people, hence, the marriage pattern of indigenous people has changed. Based on Taiwan Indigenous People Survey data and the Language Endangerment in Formosan Languages Survey data, this paper portrays the dynamic marriage patterns of indigenous people. The main findings are as follows: (1) The younger birth cohort has a higher racial intermarriage rate and lower intra-marriage rate. (2) The generational inherited marriage pattern within family varies by intermarriage type: offspring’s preference for racial intermarriage is similar to their parents, but the ethnic intermarriage does not show a signifi-cant heritage pattern. (3) The marriage pattern of some ethnic groups involves more intermarriage with Han Chinese than with other ethnic groups such as Thao, Kavalan, and Saisiyat. (4) The intimacy among ethnic groups is different: Hla’alua, Kanakanavu, and Bunun are much closer to each other, as are Kavalan with Amis. This paper portrays marriage patterns among Taiwan indigenous people based on the merged data from the two surveys, which provide rare and valuable information on inter-ethnic marriage of different indigenous tribes. The paper presents the increasing plurality of patterns of inter-ethnic marriage, manifests the different tendency of each ethnic group, and reveals the factors facilitating inter-ethnic marriage.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=292,39,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application
A Chance or A Risk? Empirical Studies on Foreign Care Workers’ Transfer of Employment,"Yu-Jung Lee, Shing-Ju Cheng","foreign care workers, transfer of employment, industrial relations, probation, classic probability","This paper discusses the possibility for foreign care workers to change employers in Taiwan. The classic theory of probability in statistics is adopted, and 26 interviews with care workers, employers, agencies, and government translators are conducted. Four concluding points are drawn for this research. First, 2008 was a turning point, when foreign care workers were given the opportunity to change employers for the first time in Taiwan. Secondly, the government should pay attention to those who switch between employers frequently during the time of their employment contracts. Thirdly, the human resource agencies specialised in importing overseas manpower often play under the table in order to avoid restrictions by government. Finally, classic probability shows that the launch of a probation mechanism will not alter the odds ratio between employees and employers. This paper therefore suggests that current policy should be changed to ensure that foreign care workers receive equal employment opportunity to transfer employers during the time of their employment contract. In fact, this change might also increase the willingness of foreign care takers to work in Taiwan.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=293,39,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application
Gendered Adolescent Friendship Networks and Gender Role Attitudes: Social Contexts of Single-Gender and Mixed-Gender Classes,"Tien-Tun Yang, Ray-May Hsung","gendered friendship networks, social contexts of classes, gender role attitudes, Exponential Random Graph Model","While adolescents are growing up, school is the place where they have the most contact with other students, and peer relationships between classmates at school are very important for adolescents. Gender always plays an important role for development of friendship among adolescents. Different behaviors and attitudes exhibited by males and females due to different traditional social expectations can result in different composition of individual social networks. Girls tend to build relationally interdependent friendship structures, and boys tend to build collectively interdependent, in-star and hierarchical friendship structures. This study explores gendered friendship networks to show the process of peer interaction in social contexts of singlegender and mixed-gender classes. At the same time, the network structure how to affect adolescent gender role attitudes. This study uses the data from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP) of Academia Sinica. The result shows that in single-gender classes, the male network structure exhibits collectively central and hierarchical characteristics, but the female and mixed-gender network structures do not. In mixedgender classes, the phenomenon of gender segregation is obvious, and males and females still tend to interact with same-gender members. Finally, in single-gender classes, individuals in core structure positions have more traditional gender role attitudes.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=294,40,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application
"The Study on the Correlation between Social Network, Sense of Community and Community Participation: Comparison of Different Communities’ Experiences of Community Building","Guang-Xu Wang, Yi-Jhen Huang","social network, community participation, sense of community, community building, social network analysis (SNA)","Community building not only has driven citizen participation recently but also has brought scholars of political science and public administration into the field of community research. It is important that community participation promote democratic society. Most previous studies have indicated that community building is good to re-establish interaction among inhabitants, and strengthen the sense of community. In addition, strong connections among residents can encourage residents to participate in public affairs, promote community development and deepen democracy. Nevertheless, there are two limitations of previous community network studies: first, the most widely used network measurement is through a perceptual approach to measuring ties, but the results cannot reveal actual relationships among residents in a community, second, most of the research results gather data from community development associations or chiefs of village rather than residents. Thus, this paper applies social network analysis (SNA) to explore relationships between residents to investigate the relationship between residents’ social networks, sense of community and community participation. More than 300 residents were systematically sampled in two communities, one with more than ten years of experience in community building, and the other with none. This study contributes by using a more rigorous research design to demonstrate the relationship between social networks, sense of community and participation, and shows that applying social network analysis can supplement the measurement of interpersonal relationships or social capital to improve reliability and validity. The analytical results verify the positive moderating effect of community building experiences.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=295,40,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application

We apply the Risk Society Wave of the Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS) 2013 to investigate these questions. Statistical findings show that different types of risk shape people’s social vulnerability, risk perception, and coping behavior: (1) Taiwanese people do worry about the world risks such as nuclear power and climate change, and their risk perception is related to their climate disaster hazards and vulnerability. Higher risk perception and social capital improve people’s coping behavior related to world risks. (2) In contrast, the more highly educated, middle aged, and females worry about human-made food insecurity risk more than others, higher risk perception and social capital improve people’s coping behavior related to human-made risks. (3) However, low socio-economic status people worry about natural disaster risks such as typhoons and earthquakes more than others, higher risk perception and social capital improve these relatively vulnerable people’s coping behavior in relation to natural disaster risks. The results show that different types of risks—world, human-made, and natural disaster risks—shape people’s social vulnerability, perceptions of hazards and risks, and coping behavior, and suggest different risk communication and risk governance strategies for the three types of risks in Taiwan.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=296,40,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application
Adolescents’ Environmental Attitudes and Behaviors: Analyzing the Opportunities and Constraints of Their Friendship Network Structure,Chih-Yao Chang,"New Ecological Paradigm, social network analysis, friendship, network features, social influence","In this paper, I profile the attitude, belief, and behavior of adolescents with regard to environmental issues via a nationwide survey to illustrate the extent to which our younger generation practices environmentalism. The opportunities and constraints of their friendship networks on disseminating the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) are further discussed. This discussion is based upon Simmel’s sociation theory, the degree to which one’s social interactions shape and reshape his/her values and actions, which results in opportunities and constraints for developing environmental education. The data collection is based on the nationwide in-school adolescent population in three age cohorts (first-year students of junior high school, high school, and college students, respectively) in 2015. The total sample size is 1,320, but the college respondens were too few to be included in the discussion here. By using social network analysis (SNA), I am able to place the following key network features of sociation: multi-dimensional friendship structures, eigenvector centrality, network constraint, network closeness, and susceptibility into the model. The findings show that adolescents had a low level of environmental engagement (only approximately five percent of our respondents displayed high environmental awareness, and even fewer had ever participated in environmental movements). Besides, the link between social and environmental engagement was of high network constraint and low eigenvector centrality, which indicates that environmental education in junior high must be highly peer-centered to spread. Moreover, popular high school students with higher levels of environmental engagement might have more influence among their peer networks, since they have stronger links to others and greater chances to help their peers become more sympathetic towards environmental problems.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=297,40,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application
Trend of Interlocking Networks of Corporate Governance in Taiwan’s Semiconductor Industry (2000–2015): Toward Small World Network,"Chi-Yi Lin, Ray-May Hsung","corporate governance, interlocked networks of board directors, interlocked networks of large owners, small world networks, semiconductor industry","Both the mobility of globalized capital and the global financial crisis have fractured the interlocking networks of board directors, producing structural breaks and causing connections to be rewired, and these networks are approaching a trend toward small world networks. This paper applies the related indexes of structural characteristics in small world networks in trend analyses of interlocking networks of board directors and large stock owners (also called interlocking networks of corporate governance) in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry from 2000 to 2015. The structural characteristics of small world networks are that the average local clustering coefficient for all points is increasing and the average path distance for all points to other points is shorter in the largest component of networks when the size of networks (i.e. number of members) becomes large. If the ratio of the average local clustering for actual networks over that for random networks is growing, and the ratio of the average shortest distance for actual networks over that for random networks is between 1 and 2, then the large and complex networks display the phenomenon of small world networks. The globalization of knowledge, technology and capital in Taiwan’s semiconductor industry has increased rapidly, and there has been a trend toward the phenomenon of small world networks for the 2000–2015 interlocking networks of board directors and large owners in this industry. The small world phenomenon varies with economic growth and recession.

Extreme rainfall is one of the most common phenomenon of climate change, and often results in damage to agriculture. However, spatially explicit assessment of potential damage to agricultural production is still absent, especially that based on units of agricultural land. Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan are the major agricultural production regions in Taiwan. Therefore, a geographic information system (GIS), agricultural census data, agricultural land-use survey data, potential flood maps, and other GIS maps are applied in this research to investigate the spatial distribution and spatial heterogeneity of potential damage due to extreme rainfall. Our findings indicate that potential damage resulting from severe rainfall differs by crop as well as production region. Therefore, disaster relief schemes need to be tailored to cope with the various damage circumstances. Applications of agricultural disaster insurance, special production zones for various crops, and strengthening agricultural facilities are suggested.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=299,41,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application
Constructing an Evaluation Model of Agricultural Tourism Production Value with a Fuzzy AHP Approach,"Yen-Cheng Chen, Ching-Sung Lee","agricultural tourism production value, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, agricultural products, core production value output","Agriculture in Taiwan has undergone transformation. The once production-based agriculture has now been supplemented or even replaced on many small farms by a service-based model. The managerial model of agricultural tourism is becoming more diversified, and the market of agricultural tourism is moving toward a mature market structure. With the emergence of agricultural tourism, the production value thus generated has become important. However, an explicit index and criteria for assessing the current value of agricultural tourism is needed. This study establishes such an index for statistical evaluation of the production value of the agricultural tourism industry, deploying the Delphi method and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). We establish three main criteria, including products, services, and expenditures. Overall, agricultural products remain an important statistical index of production value in agricultural tourism. The present study suggests that the concerned authorities in agricultural tourism apply agricultural products as the core production value output.

In response to citizens’ need to have a more responsive and democratic civil administration, it is important for public policy makers to obtain public opinions during the policy making process. However, the rise of the Internet, various information and communication technologies (ICTs), and social media has brought fundamental changes in the way society works. Consequently, traditional public opinion surveys are facing tremendous challenges, such as low response rates and difficulty in reaching younger generations. This research collects data from landlines, cell phones, and internet surveys for four years to compare different survey methods. The results show that the telephone survey has better access to respondents who are older, the mobile phone survey has better access to male respondents, and the Internet survey has more access to respondents under 40 years old. In addition, the data have shown that the population that each survey method comes into contact with differs greatly from one method to another. For future policy-related surveys, a post-stratified weighting procedure is suggested to integrate samples from various survey methods, so that the samples contacted by the surveys conform more closely to the true populations.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=301,41,2018,Survey Research - Method and Application

To comply with the stipulations of the PIP Act, the Ministry of the Interior started restricting the use of any personal information from the population register, even for academic research. Unsurprisingly, the large-scale face-to-face surveys with the newly designed address-based sampling (ABS) strategies, after 30 years of reliance on governmental register-based sampling, became less feasible and reliable. ABS often requires selection, in each household, of a single person or one respondent only as the designated (or target) respondent for the interview. Leslie Kish pioneered the random selection of members within a household. Since then, several approaches of selecting household members have been adopted in survey practices. A technique in which the interviewer used the last two digits of the address number to randomly select the designated respondent was designed in this study. To investigate the performance of the proposed method, we conducted a simulation to generate samples by using various sample selection methods.

Sexual Difference on Corruption Tolerance,"Hung-Lin Tao, Yu-Heng Chiou","corruption, sex, work, occupation, success","Using ISSP 2009, this study finds that, compared to men, women are more intolerant toward corruption. This conclusion holds even after controlling for work status, occupation, and income. Respondents with bad current work status (unemployment), low occupational status, and low income tend to be more tolerant of corruption, particularly for men. Although unemployment makes women more tolerant of corruption, it makes men much more tolerant of corruption. The difference in the degree of tolerance toward corruption between the highest and the lowest occupational statuses is greater for men than for women. Income is irrelevant to how women perceive the relation between success and corruption, but low income leads men to believe that to succeed one must be corrupt. Depression literature shows that the main sources of men’s depression are related to achievement and employment, while our study demonstrates that men with low achievement are more likely to perceive success with a sour-grapes view. Enhancing women’s working status does not change their degree of tolerance toward corruption. Therefore, no matter whether the tolerance difference between the sexes is from nature or nurture, increasing women’s participation in politics and law enforcement is expected to reduce corruption.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=304,42,2019,Survey Research - Method and Application
Respondents’ Manifestations of Extraversionin Survey Interviews: Their Relationships withthe Extreme Response Style and Attitude Strength,Meng-Li Yang,"extreme response style, extraversion, participation eagerness, atmosphere of interview, attitude stability","Two contradictory perspectives concern the significance of extreme responses in survey data, and each is supported by abundant empirical studies. One school holds that extreme responses indicate extreme and hence strong attitudes. The other considers extreme responses to be merely due to the extreme response style (ERS). The contradiction implies that the extent of the validity of extreme responses as an indicator of strong attitudes may need to be investigated by simultaneous examinations from the two perspectives. However, no such study exists. Furthermore, interviewers rely more or less on respondents’ characteristics of extraversion to complete an interview. Yet, people higher on extraversion are more likely to have the ERS. This leads to uncertainty about the response quality of cooperative respondents. This study distinguishes two types of extra verted respondents: eager participants and friendly respondents. It forms four hypotheses: (1) Initial extreme responses involve ERS more than strong attitudes. (2) Respondents with higher levels of friendliness are more likely to have ERS. (3) Respondents with higher levels of participation eagerness are more likely to have ERS. (4) Respondents with higher levels of participation eagerness are more likely to have strong attitudes. However, we do not expect that respondents with higher levels of friendliness are more likely to have strong attitudes. The hypotheses are tested by analyzing data of the “Survey Research on Attitudes toward Death Penalty and Related Values in Taiwan” in HLM models. AIC is used to compare model fits in testing hypothesis 1.

Ethnic Voting Behavior of Taiwan’s Indigenous Electorate: A Case Study of the 2012 Mountain Indigenous Legislators Election,"Cheng-hao Pao, Ying-lung Chou","indigenous people, voting choice, ethnic voting","One of the characteristics of indigenous politics in Taiwan is that groups with a larger population usually control more political resources. It has always been the case that Taiwan’s indigenous legislators usually come from the plain dwelling Amis and mountain dwelling Atayal and Paiwan. The explanation for this phenomenon is that indigenous people have a tendency toward ethnic voting. This argument is empirically based on election results. However, using aggregate level data to make inferences about individual voters’ voting behavior might give rise to a problem of ecological fallacy.Therefore, this study explores the indigenous people’s voting behavior by using data from the 2013 Indigenous Political Behaviors and Attitudes Survey. The model indicates that mountain indigenous people had a tendency toward ethnic voting in the 2012 Legislators Election, and the pan-Atayal were more willing to vote for the candidates from their ethnic group than for candidates from the Paiwan. This phenomenon makes us understand that a given candidate has an “inner territory” which consists of his/her hometown and nearby townships, and this is one substantial feature of ethnic voting behavior for indigenous electoral politics. For other indigenous voters who are neither Paiwan nor pan-Atayal, party identification is the key factor having impact on their voting participation.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=306,42,2019,Survey Research - Method and Application

It first tackles the response differences among open-ended and closed-ended questions by grouping in terms of question topic. It then further studies the factors that play a role in influencing an individual’s political knowledge. The findings suggest that question format significantly affects individuals’ responses. Answering the same question wording but in different question formats, the respondents obtained higher scores on closed-ended than open-ended questions. Knowledge questions on the topic of politicians had a higher difference, while the knowledge questions on policies displayed a narrower gap. Secondly and unsurprisingly, variables such as the level of education, media exposure, and age played important roles in one’s level of political knowledge. Thirdly, those who paid more attention to election news through the media of television and internet performed better with open-ended questions. This finding illustrates that media exposure positively facilitated political knowledge. Lastly, a further study was done by examining the interaction effects between question format and gender. Different question for mats highlight the gender gap. Closed-ended questions narrowed the knowledge gap between males and females, whereas, to some extent, a larger knowledge gap was found in open-ended questions.

Reconsidering the Measure of Educational Attainment: A Panel Study of Undergraduates’ Political Knowledge and Attitudes,Kuang-hui Chen,"political socialization, political knowledge, education, questionnaire design","The proportion of people with higher education degrees has substantially increased in the last few decades due to the rapid expansion of higher education in Taiwan. It is common in survey research to measure individuals’ educational attainment in terms of the “level” of education they have attained, which ignores the possible heterogeneity among those who share the same level of educational attainment. Two factors are adopted to divide subgroups among undergraduate students: the first factor is whether the undergraduates surveyed are attending a public school or a private one, the second factor is whether the higher education institution the respondent is attending is a university or a vocational college. This paper thus aims to examine the political knowledge and attitudes possessed by a cohort of undergraduate students from a horizontal perspective to see whether there exists substantial deviation among the subgroups (public/private and university/vocational college). The analysis of panel data indicates that first-year undergraduate students from different types of schools indeed possess unequal levels of political knowledge and attitudes. The gap not only remains significant during the period of attaining higher education, but becomes wider when it is assessed shortly before graduation. It is therefore recommended that survey research should revise the measurement of educational attainment as a response to the expansion of higher education. For respondents holding higher education degrees, we recommend adding questions in surveys to collect data on the type of university or college the respondents graduated from to gather more complete data, and this information should be useful for future studies on similar topics.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=308,43,2019,Survey Research - Method and Application
Influence of Corporate Image and Service Quality on the Satisfaction and Behavioral Intention of Exhibitors,"Li-hsien Chien, Shu-yi Chi","structural equation model (SEM), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), service quality, corporate image, exhibitors","This study discusses the influence of the image and service quality of an exhibition organizer (the National Farmers’ Association, NFA) on exhibitors’ satisfaction and how the satisfaction affects follow-up re-connect intentions. Covariate-based structural equation modeling with confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were applied to analyze interview data from 113 exhibitors who had participated in exhibitions abroad hosted by the NFA in the last five years. Empirical results show that the most influential concerns for exhibitors to decide whether to participate in exhibitions are “intensive industrial attachment” and “more new business”. Satisfaction with the “exhibition’s performance” is proven to be the most significant factor in influencing the behavioral intention of exhibitors. Positive influences of both service quality and corporate image on exhibitors’ satisfaction are significant, also, the image factor is shown to act as a partial mediator. Exhibitors give consistently high ratings to the NFA on their service and reputation, therefore, a higher registration fee is feasible. Overall, it is shown that the NFA is able to manage the business of exhibitions abroad well, with profitable expansion strategies, to strengthen exhibitors’ loyalty by providing reliable services with its good reputation.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=309,43,2019,Survey Research - Method and Application
Time is Money: A Comparison of the Cost of a Dual-Frame Telephone Survey Based on the Length of Interview,Hung-chia Chen,"random selection within household, cell phone survey, land phone survey, survey cost, dual-frame telephone survey","Because of the calling fee, cell phone surveys are expected to be more expensive than land phone surveys. This study examined this assumption by analyzing data from a dual-frame telephone survey on consumer intentions. Contrary to the expectation, the results indicate that the cost of cell phone surveying was lower than land phone surveying because the length of cell phone interviews was shorter. This can be attributed to the fact that cell phone surveys do not need to conduct random selection within a household, and the respondents of cell phone surveys are usually younger and have higher levels of education. Given that the potential for non-coverage bias continues to increase as the cell-only population grows, this study suggests that it is necessary to adopt dual-frame telephone surveying. At a minimum, the cost of cell phone surveys should no longer be a crucial concern.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=310,43,2019,Survey Research - Method and Application
Monitoring Interview Duration for Survey Quality Control,"Shu-Hui Hsieh, Ming-Yung Lee","interview duration, survey quality control, control chart, Taiwan Social Change Survey, principle components analysis","To collect data in social sciences, it is common to use question-naire survey methods. Data quality is essentially a function of the mag-nitude of error in data. If data have sufficient accuracy, it is said that the data quality is high. On the other hand, if the magnitude of error in data is large, the data are said to have poor quality. These criteria for data quality can be applied when using data to estimate population param-eters. There are two forms of error in estimating parameters. The first, known as sampling error, is the error as a result of drawing a probability sample rather than conducting a complete enumeration. The second, known as nonsampling error, refers to all other forms of error that can occur during data collection and processing procedures. Therefore, efforts to improve data quality are directed at nonsampling error. Biemer and Lyberg (2003) provide an extensive discussion of methods for data quality improvement. They suggest focusing on steps to improve the data collection process. Often a good-quality process implies good quality of both the data sampled and the resulting output.  Using paradata and time stamps to manage survey data collection can lead to a more efficient operation that produces higher quality data at lower cost. In this study, we explore the effect of interview duration on data quality in the Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS). The TSCS, the first nationally representative survey in Taiwan, was established in 1985 and is conducted through face-to-face interviews. In it, interview-ers are instructed to perform their tasks according to the key principles of standardized interviewing. If the interviewer complies with standard-ized procedures, an abnormal interview duration is less likely. Con-versely, if the interviewer deviates from the standardized procedures, there is higher probability of an abnormal interview duration. Interview duration is very important for the interviewer with regard to planning fieldwork activities, and is a factor which influences his or her cost and benefit analysis. Short and well-paid interviews are financially and organizationally more attractive. Japec (2005) suggested monitoring interview duration, since it can tell us something about data quality. This paper addresses the problem of quality control in a survey based on interview duration data, and applies control charts to the moni-toring process. We conducted this process in three parts: (1) classifica-tion of interviewers based on interview duration data using principal components analysis. The aim was to improve the efficiency of monitor-ing the data collection process. (2) detection of the optimal rate among different interviewers’ classifications, and avoidance of continually collecting data by using non-standard interview procedures which affect the quality of survey data. (3) use of a median control chart to monitor the potential causes of variation between individual interviewers to find out why some interviewers’ interview times exceed the control limit. To assess the applicability of the proposed method, we used the 2015 Work and Life module of the TSCS to illustrate the proposed process for survey quality control. The research goal of this article was not simply to monitor, but also to improve the quality of the process over time. Based on the proposed process, it is notable that the inspection operation cost can be more effectively controlled.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=311,44,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
Disparity in Resource Allocation between Community Care Centers and the Demand Population in Taiwan: An Evaluation Conducted by Geographic Accessibility,"Ming-Hseng Tseng, Hui-Ching Wu","community care center, community-based care, geographic accessibility, resources allocation, spatial inequality","Neighborhood social networks are influential for the elderly’s health and well-being, and community-based care can enhance their participation in social activities. The geographic accessibility of com-munity care centers can reduce traffic inconvenience and advance the policy of active aging. This study focuses on the congruence between the demand population and the distribution of the supply of appropriate resources. The investigation applied the methods of Pearson’s correla-tion, geographical accessibility, and the Gini coefficient to explore the service loading ratio of, resource ownership of, and nearest distance to community care centers. In this study, community care centers were held to be the supply points for the resources based on information derived from open data available in 2017. The demand population of the elderly was calculated according to the population aged 65 years or older in 2017. On the basis of these methods and data, our study provides a com-parative analysis by using the administrative district average method, the nearest distance method of the same administrative district, and the nearest distance method of cross-county resource sharing. The results obtained from this investigation demonstrate the incon-sistency between the density of the demand population location and the geographical distribution of community care centers. First, Pearson’s correlation coefficients show a low degree of conformity in the resource allocation’s demand and supply. This finding indicates inconsistency between the resource supply and the demand population. Second, according to the amount of service loading, 50% of the centers show below-average values. These figures indicate that the locations are isolated or are adjacent to each other and are thus lacking in demand population. Third, based on the largest average of the nearest distances, the top five counties were found to be rural. Applying the nearest dis-tance method of cross-county sharing of resources to reassess acces-sibility, all except Taitung County can shorten the nearest distance. These results support our research position of encouraging local gov-ernments to share community care centers. Finally, based on the service resource ownership rates of the demand population (geographic acces-sibility scores), the Gini coefficients are between 0.4~0.7, emphasizing the seriousness of the inequality between the resource supply and the demand population.  In sum, the appraisal of spatial resource allocation is a key issue for governmental agenda-setting, whereby geographic accessibility assessments should examine both the demand side (e.g. elderly demand population, and rural/urban locations of administrative districts) and the supply side (e.g. distance factor, and capacity of community care centers). Geographic accessibility and the equality of resource distri-bution need to be examined synchronously in order to optimize the spatial locations of community-based care resources. Our study sug-gests that effective policy creation can allow the demand population, regardless of the area of the registered permanent residence, to make use of community care centers, and encourages local governments to cooperate and to share their community care resources. Through our policy suggestion of the cross-county sharing of resources, the incon-sistencies between the demand population and the distribution of the supply of resources can easily be improved by enhancing the geographic accessibility of the elderly. This move can help the elderly to avail themselves of community care centers, and promote the execution of the “aging in place” policy goal.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=312,44,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
Using National Health Insurance Database for Sampling Surveys,"Jack C. Yue, Yu-Min Chien, Yin-Yee Leong","de jure population, National Health Insurance, big data, census, migration","Censuses are usually the only method for collecting information on a national population, and they are conducted every ten years for most countries. Taiwan’s government also conducts censuses every ten years to collect information on the de jure population, covering the shortage of the household registration system. However, there are potential problems in the traditional census, such as low response rates, poor data quality, outdated information and rising survey costs. Taiwan, like a lot of countries, has been seeking alternative methods for collecting national data and decided to use sampling surveys (of about 16% of the national population) to replace the whole population census in 2010 and 2020, in order to cope with the problems of low response rates and rising survey costs. Still, the sampling survey cannot provide timely population information in Taiwan. The rolling census is one of the new methods which can offer up-to-date information, and was first adapted by the U.S. and France in 2010. The rolling census in the U.S., American Community Survey, collected data on 3% of the national population annually for five years, and this can deliver a time series of national estimates for those five years. In this study, we aim to explore new data collection methods which can serve as an alternative to the traditional census and provide timely population information. In particular, our goal is to evaluate the possibility of using data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database for acquiring information on the de jure population in Taiwan. In particular, we use the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 (LHID2005) in this study. In addition to records on upper respiratory tract infections, we also propose three other methods based on the records of outpatient visits to identify the place of normal residence. We choose outpatient rates and other criteria from the NHI data for method evaluation, and find that the medical cost of outpatient visits less than 555 points (one point is close to one New Taiwan Dollar) is the most appropriate method. To demonstrate the feasibility of using NHI data to acquire the population information, we apply the proposed methods to explore the domestic migration in Taiwan. The official records of Taiwan’s domestic migration are available only at the level of province and special municipality, and are not accessible for counties and townships. To make up for the deficiency of official records, we estimate the domestic immigrants and emigrants at the level of electoral circumscription (73 seats) for members of the Legislative Yuan. The population of each electoral circumscription is between 200,000 and 500,000, smaller than that of counties and larger than that of townships. The results show that the domestic migration in Taiwan can be separated into three sub-regions: northern, central, and southern Taiwan. The migration activities are active within each region, but not as active between regions. Also, the six major cities (or special municipalities) in Taiwan, each with population of at least two million, attract most of the domestic immigrants, and the remote areas (such as eastern counties) have the highest emigration rates.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=313,44,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
Hedonic and Descriptive Sensory Evaluation and Analysis—An Application to Taiwan Alpine Tea,"Li-Hsien Chien, Shu-Yi Chi, Chin-Nien Tai","Alpine tea, tea sensory evaluation, taste and aroma, PLS-SEM, IPMA.","Taiwan alpine (high mountain) tea products are very popular with consumers due to their unique flavors and aroma, and have become high-priced agricultural products in recent years due to the planting altitude. In practice, there is a lack of attribute research to identify and evaluate product quality, and to use as a reference for pricing the tea efficiently. Application of quantitative analysis of the tea’s chemical composition for determining the source of tea products is also quite limited. These limitations make it quite difficult to distinguish the various products in the different producing areas, and often lead to confusion and disputes. The present study identified and applied five primary sensory evaluation constructs of tea, namely appearance, tea color, taste, aroma, and leaf shape, to evaluate whether a hedonic attribute index of alpine tea can adequately describe products from different areas. A total of seventeen indices were chosen from the five constructs of the most popular tea competition evaluation standards. Twenty-two sensory experts conducted the evaluation of fifteen tea samples from the five tea areas of Renai (Cingjing, Hehuanshan, Fushoushan, Qilaishan, and Dayuling) in Nantou to identify the specific attributes of that area’s tea. We tested the significance of the practical attribute items corresponding to the five sensory characteristics with a partial least squares path model and examined the differences in sensory evaluation indicators between the five Nantou tea areas with multi-group analysis. The major conclusions are as follows: (1) The main chemical components of tea, such as total catechins, showed significantly different results in tea products of the same tea species at different altitudes. Thus, quantitative analysis of the main chemical components can provide clues to the altitude of the tea plantation location. However, if the tea areas are very close to each other, this method may not effectively discriminate between the differences. (2) Practical hedonic indexes for high mountain tea sensory application were established. The results show that the sensory attributes effectively provide a sound basis to identify alpine tea products for different tea regions. In this study, based on the existing five major constructs of the evaluation framework, and by expert opinions and practical operations, we established seventeen descriptive operational variables for the evaluation of mountain tea in five areas. (3) A workable attribute tool for segmenting tea products was established. A two-dimensional map framed by taste and aroma, two popular sensory constructs, was developed and is provided with the multi-group analysis. The descriptive evidence can assist the local industry chain in promoting its local agricultural products by linking the qualities of tea products to their specific areas of origin. The present research shows that the hedonic attribute index for Taiwanese alpine tea established in this study is able to accurately measure the products of different mountain tea areas. Quantitative analysis provides the altitude information of the tea product at the first stage. The sensory indexes in this study are then able to further identify the source of the product by its attributes, and should effectively reduce market disputes and improve efficiency.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=314,44,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
Applications and Trends of Big-data and AI Methods in Behavioral and Social Sciences,Tsung-Ren Huang,"big data, artificial intelligence, behavioral sciences, social","The digital era fosters the blossoming of research methods that can collect and analyze big data of human behavior for descriptive, correlational, and experimental studies in behavioral and social sci-ences. More and more studies leverage the internet or smartphones to collect big data and adopt artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as machine learning, to accurately model the big data. As researchers become more enthusiastic about these new approaches, they also gradually learn the limitations of such big-data and AI methods. Compared to paper-based surveys and laboratory experiments, inter-net- or smartphone-based approaches of data collection often com-promise data quality over quantity because such data collection pro-cesses, despite being less constrained by space and time, are also less controlled by researchers. Similarly, compared to traditional statisti-cal models, AI’s algorithm-based approaches of data analysis often compromise model simplicity over accuracy because such data mod-els, in order to capture complex regularities in data, are inevitably complex and hence less explainable. As a result of these relative advantages and disadvantages of big-data and AI methods, the trends of applying them in behavioral and social sciences in the 2010s are, to some extent, circular—the rise of big-data and AI methods leads to a re-appreciation of traditional research methods and subsequent development of hybrid approaches. To elaborate on the circularity, the present article reviews the relevant literature published between 2010 and 2019 from the perspecitves of data collection, data analysis, and study reproducibility. Specifically, in terms of data collection, behavioral and social sciences were grounded in small data, grew an interest in big data for their potential of testing universality of research findings, and then turned back to collect relatively quality-assured small data. In terms of data analysis, behavioral and social scientists developed theories predominantly using explanatory statis-tical models, being attracted to but at the same time felt perplexed by highly accurate predictive models that were based on machine learn-ing, and then finally found ways of making predictive models explainable. In terms of study reproducibility, although collection and analysis of big data held the promise of improving sample size, sam-ple diversity, and thus the reproducibility of results and inferences in behavioral and social sciences, ironically the study methods them-selves were becoming irreproducible because the rapidly evolving cyber environments from which research data were gathered might have irreversibly changed, or the technical threshold of repeating the same analysis was insurmountably high to most researchers in the field. How can behavioral and social scientists respond to the afore-mentioned changes and impacts brought about by big-data and AI methods? Based on foreseeable scientific and technological trajecto-ries, in the end we conclude that the hurdles of learning and applying the big-data and AI methods will be lowered and thus recommend researchers to integrate both new and old methods, which are, in fact, complementary to each other. These integrated approaches, such as aggregating big data from small studies for machine-learning analy-sis, will help researchers to see not only the forest but also the trees and ultimately help advance behavioral and social sciences.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=315,45,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
"Interpretation of Daily Human Behavior via Smartphone Digital Footprints: Examples from Smartphone Use, Sleeping Patterns, and Working Hours","Ting-Wei Chiang, Si-Yu Chen, Yu-Hsuan Lin","smartphone, mobile applications (apps), ecological momentary assessment, cyberpsychology, digital phenotyping","With the global prevalence of smartphones in recent years, we can now study human behavior and the mind via our daily interactions with smartphones. These data automatically collected by our digital devices are called “digital footprints.” They not only provide an objec-tive, real-time, and ecological source of measurement, but also provide insights into human behaviors and mental activities. The digital foot-prints from smartphones can be seen as a new opportunity for behav-ioral science and psychological research, for example, in the emerging fields of cyberpsychology, psychoinformatics, and digital phenotyping. This review introduces several studies that have applied time-series smartphone passive data to interpret common human behaviors, focus-ing on three mobile apps: “Know Addiction” for smartphone use, “Rhythm” for sleep time, and “Staff Hours” for working hours. “Know Addiction” automatically records the timestamps of screen-on, screen-off, notifications, and app usage. First, we defined an ‘epi-sode’ of smartphone use as the time period from screen-on to the suc-cessive screen-off. App-generated parameters reflecting the frequency and duration of smartphone use facilitate the identification of smart-phone addiction. Second, we shifted from smartphone-centered analysis to human-centered analysis by distinguishing “proactive use” from “reactive use.” Our prior research has shown that the duration of pro-active use, defined as the total time of the epochs without any notifica-tion within one minute before the screen-on, may be more representative of addictive behavior than the total duration of smartphone use. Third, by applying methods like empirical mode decomposition to identify trends in smartphone use, we are able to observe long-term behavioral patterns. “Rhythm” was designed to identify sleep time based on smart-phone behaviors. “Rhythm” also measures changes in sleep patterns and promotes users’ awareness of social jetlag between weekdays and weekends. By quantifying long-term circadian rhythm stability, a “digital chronotype” can be delineated. Our previous study has shown that screen time, mainly mediated by bedtime smartphone use, delayed the circadian rhythm, and reduced total sleep time.  “Staff Hours” is an app to capture working hours and patterns for medical staff in real-time. This app collects objective GPS loca-tion data longitudinally in the background with a power-saving design. Using geofencing technology, combined with self-reported work time information and on-call schedule, this app automatically records the working hours one spends in his or her workplace. “Staff Hours” improves the efficiency of labor inspection, as we can now compare real-time work hours on a large scale. Our prior study revealed that medical staff had longer work hours than non-health-care professionals, with resident physicians working the longest hours at 60.4 hours per week in hospitals. There are several advantages of using digital footprints from smart-phones in behavioral science and psychological research. First, passive data collection solves the problem of recall bias and time distortion, and results in higher user retention and temporal resolution. Moreover, smartphones show potential for immediate interventions and person-alized treatments. With the growing emphasis on medical device soft-ware nowadays, we envision that mobile apps collecting digital foot-prints will be widely used in clinical settings and public health.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=316,45,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
The Revision of the Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary 2015,"Wei-Fang Lin, Chin-Lan Huang, Yi-Cheng Lin, Chia-Ling Lee, James W. Pennebaker","LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), text analysis, big data analytics","Automated analysis of natural language in its daily use has shown to be effective in capturing psychological characteristics in the literature. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), developed by Pennebaker and his research team, is one of the most commonly used text analysis tools in the social sciences. The essential assumption of LIWC is that the frequencies of word usage in certain categories serve as language markers that index individuals’ inner thoughts and psychological processes. LIWC contains two parts, the computer software and the dictionary. The computer software is used to calcu-late the frequency of words in each category. The dictionary is the LIWC key classifying words into categories. LIWC2015 is the latest dictionary, and is based on a significant revision of its predecessor, the LIWC2007 dictionary. The aim of the current study is to develop a corresponding Chinese version of the LIWC2015 dictionary (CLIWC2015) and demonstrate its reliability and validity.  Based on the Chinese LIWC 2007 dictionary, we revised CLIWC2015 by adding and deleting corresponding categories of the LIWC2015 dictionary. We described the details of the process in Study 1. There is a total of 10,795 words belonging to 79 categories in CLIWC2015, including 25 linguistic process categories and 54 psychological process categories. Study 2 collected 100 texts from blog posts on various topics. The average total word count in each post was 1,290 in Study 2. To calculate the reliability, sentences in each text were ordered first, and then odd- and even-numbered sen-tences were grouped into two subtexts. LIWC indices were calculated for each subtext, and then correlation coefficients between the corre-sponding subtexts for each language category were used for reliabil-ity analyses. Results showed that all word categories demonstrated strong correlation effects except one punctuation category which cal-culated the frequency of the dashes usage. One possible explanation is that dashes is not a commonly used punctuation mark in the blog posts which could have lowered the reliability. To examine the valid-ity, study 3 collected 100 posts from the Ptt bulletin board system, 50 of which were from the “hate” board, and the rest were from the “sad” board. The average total word count in each post was 164 in Study 3. The two sets’ linguistic features were compared. Consistent with our hypotheses, “hate” board posts used significantly more anger, swear and netspeak words, and exclamation marks. In contrast, “sad” board posts used significantly more first-personal singular pronouns, sad, anxiety and cognitive words, and higher cognitive complexity words. Across studies 2 and 3, our findings supported the reliability and validity of the CLIWC2015 well.  Unlike traditional content analysis, which requires a great deal of time and effort, one of the most important strengths of LIWC is the ability to analyze huge text files rapidly. Recently, more and more research has applied LIWC to analyze big data. In the last part of this article, we also discussed the implications of using CLIWC2015 and its applications in Chinese culture and big data analytics.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=317,45,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
A Computational Text Analysis on the Core Issues for Public Servants: Evidence from the PTT,Mao Wang,"public servant, text mining, PTT, internal customer, structural topic model","Background: The government used to ignore the voice of public ser-vants from the bottom levels, the reasons being not only a lack of communication channels but also the fact that such information often exists exclusively within personal networks. However, along with the rise of online forums and social media, there are some communities, discussing all kinds of issues related to public jobs, mainly for public servants. One key element of public personnel management is to real-ize the problems raised by and needs of the internal customer, namely civil service, and thus this study is to investigate what issues are most discussed online by public servants. Methods and Data: Survey is a common way to understand the voice of internal customers, but it is also accompanied by certain problems, such as a narrower survey framework decided by the survey adminis-trator, and respondents’ fear of identity disclosure to their supervisors. Using textual data from online forum posts, without the downside of the survey method, and exploiting the techniques of computational text analysis are helpful to depict the issues public servants truly care about. This article focuses on textual data from the PublicServan Board  （公職板）of the PTT (like a Taiwanese version of Reddit), collects 20,616 posts which ask a question, and summarizes the content of posts through an unsupervised machine learning method.  Results: Based on the result of a structural topic model, this article examines these posts and can be clustered into 13 topics: benefits, activities, interactions, leave, examinations, procurement, reports, recruitment, reform, transfers, job rankings, appraisals, and position seeking, and compares them to the government practices we recognize, and visualizes the relationships between the topics. In this corpus, the amount of posts on each topic varies. The top four topics include: job ranking (11.15%), position seeking (10.32%), recruitment (9.61%), and interactions (9.43%), and the results reveal that qualified people tend to raise questions about how to find an “appropriate” agency and a “suitable” position. This finding is in line with the fact that the numbers of posts are higher every March and September because that is when the results of the public service exams are announced. Apart from discerning different topics, there are some discrepan-cies and contradictions between the findings from these textual data and the annual survey administered by the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration, Executive Yuan（行政院人事行政總處）. The high turnover rate is attributed to dissatisfaction with promotion by the authority, but the relationship between turnover and dissatisfaction with promotion rarely shows evidence from the posts we collect. Interactions with line managers and colleagues in the workplace often result in doubts and complaints which we can discover from textual data, yet no numeric data explicitly indicate this situation in the annual survey. Finally, the topic network adds more contextual information to specify topic categories and uncover their relationships. Conclusions: Computational text analysis does not replace tradi-tional ways of comprehending public servants, but can complement and confirm what we know about public servants. This type of analy-sis provides not merely higher or lower numbers but a meaningful context, and can, more importantly, help enhance interpretations. Some suggestions are made for the reference of the government per-sonnel authority and future research agendas.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=318,45,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
Dialogue from Experience: Exploring the Theoretical Basis and Application Challenges of Computational Social Science,Chen-Yi Yu,"computational social science, computational turn, smartphone, lifelogging","With the advancement of information technology, the use of dig-ital technology as a research tool, analytical method, and exploration approach has become a new wave of social science. This rapidly emerging trend of computational social science should itself be treated as a research subject. It is necessary to explore its methods and premises, and to think about the possibility of application, in order to enhance our understanding of its influence, value and pros-pects. Therefore, this article attempts to discuss the ontology, episte-mology and methodology of computational social sciences. The ontology of computational social sciences can be said to be a “metadatification” process, which converts various types of informa-tion into data, and performs computational processing with its mathe-matical logic. In the epistemology of computational social sciences, algorithms are used to sort out patterns and structures that were pre-viously undetectable to the naked eye, and to find correlations or rules from the data pile. The methodology emphasizes that mechani-cal objectivity can be used to filter out artificial biases to produce rigorous knowledge. However, when we apply computational approaches, we must still reflect on its knowledge assumptions in order to find an appropriate method to integrate with social interpre-tative approaches. First, the form of research data is diverse, and not all are suitable for conversion to byte format. Second, the meaning of patterns and structures is not self-explanatory, but relies on human interpretation to bring context and meaning in order to make it into thick data. Third, it is necessary to be honest in the process of data intermediation, including the determination of the scope of data col-lection, the process of data translation and cleaning, and the final pre-sentation of data, all of which are full of traces of social construction. Through my research experience of data collection and analysis by using a computational approach, I will discuss how the data analy-sis of the computational approach can be used in conjunction with the narrative interpretation method to promote the understanding of social facts. I use a mobile app to collect the temporary data of people using social media to understand the temporal structure and mechanism of social media’s integration into daily life. This technology-assisted method can help me collect more accurate and detailed information, and I also use in-depth interviews to understand the context and meaning behind the data. The data obtained from the mobile app, like cultural probes, gives an overview of the usage scenarios, finds out the structure of the usage patterns, and then illuminates an entrance for us, allowing us to see the deeper meanings in the context. In other words, data and interviews are complementary, both by using data to stimulate narratives and deepening data by using narratives. In addition, I also discuss how digital technology-assisted forms of data collection pose complex challenges to method ethics, includ-ing changes in the nature of the field, and research ethics and privacy protection issues. With such a positive understanding and dialogue with digital technology methods, we hope that we can continue to develop new, appropriate and mutually inclusive ways to cope with the social world that has gradually been involved in technology.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=319,45,2020,Survey Research - Method and Application
Comparative Analysis and Application of Imputed Estimators for Population Mean under Stratified Unequal Probability Sampling,Esher Hsu,"nonresponse, ratio imputation, imputed estimator, bias-adjusted estimator, unequal probability sampling","With continuously increasing demand for accurate data, the sampling design of surveys has become more and more complex. Unequal probability sampling methods are therefore increasingly used in sample surveys. Item nonresponse is inevitable in survey practice. How to obtain unbiased estimation with data imputation for a complex survey is thus an important issue for research. Previous studies have presented some imputed estimators for equal probability sampling with uniform response. It would be worthwhile to explore the performance of imputed estimators applied to complex surveys, such as unequal probability sampling or different missing data mechanisms. This study aims to present imputed estimators of the population mean for survey data imputed with an auxiliary variable under a stratified unequal probability sampling design, and to compare their performance in terms of different missing data mechanisms and different levels of the correlation coefficient between the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest. By taking nonresponse and imputation into account, this study derives three imputed estimators (weighted, unweighted, and bias-adjusted imputed estimators) and their corresponding variance estimators with stratified unequal probability sampling, where missing data are imputed by ratio imputation. Six cases under different conditions (missing data mechanisms, population distribution, and sample allocation) are selected for a simulation study to compare the performance of the proposed imputed estimators in terms of relative bias and coefficient of variation. The relative bias of the variance estimators is also studied to compare the performance of the corresponding variance estimators. A practical application is performed to show how to apply the imputed estimators derived in this study to real survey data. As expected, simulation results show that the performance of the estimators varies depending on the missing data mechanisms, population distributions, and methods of sample allocation. Simulation results indicate that the estimation precision of the imputed estimator increases as the correlation between the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest increases for all three imputed estimators. The imputed estimators perform with greater stability in cases of missing completely at random (MCAR) than in cases of missing at random (MAR). Comparing the performance among the three imputed estimators, this study shows that in cases of high correlation between the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest, the proposed bias-adjusted estimator works well with stratified unequal probability sampling in reducing the estimation bias and the underestimation of mean square error (MSE) due to unweighted imputation. Moreover, the variance estimator of the bias-adjusted estimator has the smallest relative bias for estimating MSE compared with the two others. The unadjusted imputed estimator with unweighted imputation may cause estimation bias, while its corresponding variance estimators may also underestimate the MSE of the estimator. However, simulation results do not reveal that the bias-adjusted estimator performs better than the imputed estimator with weighted imputation except at a high level of correlation between the auxiliary variable and the variable of interest. In practice, an auxiliary variable which has high correlation with the variable of interest, is commonly used to impute missing values to increase estimation precision. If the survey weights are unavailable and unweighted ratio imputation is used to impute missing values, the proposed bias-adjusted estimator with the corresponding variance estimator is suggested for obtaining a better estimation.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=322,46,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
Measurement and Application of Income Variables in Political Science Survey Research,"Chi-lin Tsai, Tsung-han Tsai","income, earnings, opinion poll, sample representativeness, measurement bias","As a key indicator of socioeconomic status, income plays an important role in social sciences and has been a routine socio-demographic item on many opinion polls. However, in Taiwanese political science studies, the use of the income item is far less common than the use of other socio-demographics such as gender, age and education. Data quality is arguably a major problem that puts researchers off from using income data from surveys. In this paper, we examine this problem for the purpose of laying the foundations for future research to improve survey measurement and application of income variables.First, we discuss the issues of income measurement at every stage of the survey process from a methodological perspective and with the support of empirical evidence from various fields of literature. In seeking solutions to those issues, we trace the evolution of income measurement of the American National Election Studies from the 1940s onwards, along with several long-standing, large-scale academic survey projects in Europe. This review identifies a number of designs aimed at a more comprehensible wording of the income question, a more standardised procedure to elicit income information, and a more sensible way to keep income responses confidential. We recommend Taiwanese pollsters apply these potentially useful designs in future surveys for better income measurement.Second, we investigate the existing income data of Taiwanese surveys. Our analysis of the 2001–2017 data from Taiwan’s Election and Democratization Studies (TEDS) found noticeable discrepancies between official statistics and survey estimates of the average population income. Further analysis suggests that those discrepancies are partly due to the positive correlation between income and unit nonresponse — in line with our previous methodological discussion. In addition, there has been a non-trivial amount of item nonresponse in the income data of TEDS, which adds another layer of complexity to the use of those data in research. We suspect that these problems are not unique to TEDS, but rather common among political opinion polls in Taiwan, because most of them have measured income in a similar way.Despite those problems, we found that the income variables of TEDS are useful as a strong indicator of respondents’ subjective socioeconomic status, hence making a good complement to objective indicators such as education and occupation. This finding, together with those aforementioned, provides a general guide to using the existing income data of political surveys in Taiwan: avoid treating them as a measure of absolute wealth, but use them as an indicator of socioeconomic status. In this regard, these income data, though imperfect, should still serve the needs of many social science studies.Last, with respect to using income data of surveys in research, item nonresponse is an inevitable problem. A common practice to handle this problem is the “complete-case method” — that is, excluding non-respondents from analysis and focusing solely on respondents without any missing data. In view of its widespread use, we highlight the pros and cons of this method, and make explicit reference to the condition under which it works and the condition it does not work in, in order to provide researchers a quick guide to making good use of the complete-case method to deal with item nonresponse in income data.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=323,46,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
Linking Understanding of Citizenship to Political Activism: A Comparative Study across 29 Democracies,Hsin-hao Huang,"political activism, citizenship norms, rights consciousness, multi-group analysis","Active citizenship is one of the defining features of contemporary democracies. Many empirical studies on democratic citizens emphasize their attitudinal and behavioral characteristics, such as critical citizens, monitorial citizens, and self-actualizing citizens. However, few of them deal with how citizens understand “citizenship” itself. By addressing citizens’ understanding of citizenship, this study investigates how the understanding, including civic responsibilities and rights, can inspire political activism, and examines these relationships cross-nationally. The author employs citizenship norms and rights consciousness as individual-level notions of citizenship. These two indicate how people see civic responsibilities and rights, respectively. In terms of citizenship norms, since norms are able to shape role expectations that individuals believe they should satisfy, their content is expected to determine their related behavior. In this sense, duty-related norms can weaken political activism, but engagement-related ones will strengthen political activism. In addition, rights consciousness should encourage political activism, and its different domains may affect the willingness to act separately. It is because that perception represents an awareness of the need to defend one’s rights, which would stimulate their willingness to act in politics. As for cross-national differences, it is expected that relationships between citizens’ understanding of citizenship and political activism are generally stronger in stable democracies than in new democracies. At the national level, signs of progress in citizenship rights apparently differ between the two groups of countries. At the individual level, having more democratic experience and opportunities leads to citizens being more likely to apply their understanding in actual political activities. The data analyzed are from the 2014 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP). The scope of this study includes 29 democratic countries, and the final pooled sample size is 42,355. The empirical analyses are divided into two parts. This study first conducts several nested multiple regression models to demonstrate the links between political activism and understanding of citizenship. Regarding citizenship norms, civil norms are found to weaken political activism, while both political and social norms have a positive effect on individuals’ willingness to act in politics. As for rights consciousness, either the political or civil and social domain is able to increase political activism. The second step involves conducting a comparison between respondents in the stable and new democracies. Using multi-group analysis, this study examines how the relationships differ between stable and new democracies. The empirical results show that except for social norms, all the citizenship norms and rights consciousness have, as expected, a stronger effect on political activism in the stable-democracies samples than in their new-democracies counterparts, whether it is negative or positive. The evidence reflects the fact that with more democratic experience and opportunities, citizens in stable democracies are more likely than those in new democracies to apply their understanding of citizenship in actual political activities. This study demonstrates the importance of understanding of citizenship for affecting political activism and illustrates how these effects differ between stable and new democracies. The results contribute to our understanding of political behavior, democratic deepening, and democratic civic education.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=324,46,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
The Generation of Friendship Networks and Academic Consulting Networks within High School Classes,"Chiu-Yuan Wu, Ko-Hua Yap","network dynamics, friendship similarity, social context of classes, relational formation, STERGMs","This study attempts to carry out three pioneering achievements: comparing differences in friendship networks between an elite class and a normal class in a high school, conducting surveys of academic consulting networks among high school students, and taking a lead in analyzing how high school students’ friendships and consulting relationships are generated by using “separable temporal exponential random graph models” (STERGMs).Previous studies have revealed that high school students tended to form friendships with classmates who had academic performance similar to theirs, and some studies have emphasized that teenagers’ friendships developed from class contexts they were in. However, the present study first reveals that class contexts will influence high school students’ tendency to form friendships based on academic similarity. Many high schools in Taiwan put students with higher academic performance together in one class, and they strive all out to attend top universities or medical colleges. The academic differences between these selected elite students are usually smaller than the differences between students in normal classes. However, in this study, students of the selected elite class still can form friendships with classmates who have academic performance more similar to their own. By contrast, it is not apparent in a normal class that students form friendships depending on academic similarity. The results here show that a class context with intense focus on academic performance may indeed increase the tendency for stu-dents to choose friends based on similar grades.Secondly, most studies of teenager social networks have focused on friendships. The current study attempts to conduct surveys of high school students’ academic consulting for each subject. Results demonstrate that high school students are shrewd when choosing suitable peer consultants. In addition to choosing friends as consultants directly, high school students also clearly know how to choose peer consultants for each subject based on their classmates’ academic performance in each subject. Besides, it is not common to find reciprocity in such academic consulting. In many situations, the consultant does not intend to obtain helpful information from the receiver. It can be seen from this that the academic consulting network is more like a hierarchical structure. Students with lower academic performance often receive advice from students with higher academic performance unilaterally. This kind of network structure creates chances for knowledge to flow from students with higher academic performance to those with lower academic performance.On the other hand, this study reveals that academic consulting is one of the ways for high school students to develop friendships. The receivers may develop friendships with the consultants who were not friends at first. This finding implies a more significant meaning. Assuming that students with higher academic performance only establish relationships with students who are similar to them, the academic gap would be unfillable or even aggravated. If consulting relationships could be further expanded into friendships, the academic gap would be mitigated, since the consulting relationships often bridge students with higher and lower academic performance.The experience of the present study also provides beneficial inspiration for future research designs.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=325,46,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
Design of Cohabitation Questions: Findings from the Panel Study of Family Dynamics,"Ruoh-Rong Yu, Pei-Shan Liao","cohabitation, questionnaire design, interviewer effect, third-party presence effect, Panel Study of Family Dynamics","In a society which lacks a registration system for cohabitation, whether an individual is cohabiting with someone relies on self-reported information. The quality of the self-reported information matters for estimates of proportions of cohabitation. Such information is also important for research in the fields of demography and family studies on the topics of, for example, reproductive behavior and gender equality. Cohabitation is often asked as one of the options for marital status, while some see it a type of living arrangement. In some societies, however, cohabitation is considered to be a sensitive issue because it is not a legal marital status, and thus respondents might under-report cohabitation when asked relevant questions.In Taiwan, self-reported survey data are the main source of information for habitation. This response option is often combined with being married due to its sensitivity, or viewed as a distinct option in the marital status question. It is important to understand whether the design of cohabitation question affects respondents’ self-reported behavior. Using panel data from the Taiwan Panel Study of Family Dynamics (PSFD), this study examines the effects of changes in the cohabitation question on the respondents’ answers. The PSFD is a longitudinal survey project initiated in 1999. Up till the survey conducted in 2014, the question on marital status contained seven answer options: unmarried, cohabiting, married, separated, divorced, widowed, and other. Starting with the 2016 PSFD survey, the seven-option marital status question has been revised into a two-question version. The question on marital status is asked first with six mutually exclusive options: unmarried, married, separated, divorced, widowed, and others. Respondents who select the options legally compatible with cohabitation (including “unmarried,” “divorced,” and “widowed”) are then asked whether they are cohabiting with someone.The difference in the probability of reporting cohabitation between the 2014 and 2016 in-person surveys is analyzed based on the sample who are legally compatible with the cohabitation status. For this analytical purpose, the sample of the 2014 survey is confined to the respondents who chose “unmarried,” “divorced,” “widowed,” or “cohabiting” from the question on marital status. As to the sample of the 2016 survey, it is limited to the respondents who selected “unmarried,” “divorced,” or “widowed” when answering the first item. Using the merged data, the random-effects logit model is applied to analyze the respondents’ likelihood of reporting cohabitation.In addition to analyzing the effects of changes in question design, we also explore whether interviewer characteristics and third-person presence matter for the respondents’ likelihood of answering cohabitation. Interviewer characteristics include the interviewers’ gender, age, and interviewing experience. The dummies on third-person presence contain three categories: presence of direct family member(s), presence of non-direct family member(s), and no third-person presence. The findings indicate that the probability of reporting cohabitation is about seven times higher in the 2016 survey with the revised ques tion on marital status than that in the 2014 survey with the original design. With respect to interviewer effects, none of the interviewer variables is significant. The results on third-person presence effects reveal that the presence of direct family member(s) is associated with a lower probability of reporting cohabitation than that of no third-person presence. The presence of non-direct family member(s) shows an opposite effect. These findings suggest that who the third person is matters for the respondents’ self-reporting of cohabitation. This study not only contributes to our understanding of the effects of question design for cohabitation on the respondents’ answers, but also provides implications for improving the design of the cohabitation question.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=327,47,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
Determinants of Disaster Mitigation Behaviors in Taiwan,"Hui Hsuan Yang, Hsiang-chieh Lee","disaster risk, vulnerability, mitigation, disaster-prone areas","This research investigated determinants of typhoon and earthquake mitigation behaviors in Taiwan based on risk analysis of hazards, exposure, and vulnerability, supplemented by the protective action decision model (PADM). Besides psychological condition (i.e., risk perception, life satisfaction, and anxiety), demographics, and socio-economic characteristics factors (i.e., gender, age, ratio of home ownership, and average monthly income per household) mentioned in the PADM, this research added factors of family structure, social network, and internet and social media usage in the analysis. All of these factors were for the concept of social vulnerability—one dimension of risk analysis. Furthermore, this research used the factor of disaster-prone areas (i.e., disaster experiences, flood-prone areas, and number of protected people possibly affected by debris flow) to represent another dimension of risk analysis: the intersection of hazard and exposure. The 2020 Taiwan Social Change Survey data and multiple hierarchical regression analysis were used for analysis. The results showed that (1) the demographic and socio-economic factor had the greatest impact on mitigation behaviors among all the factors when added hierarchically in the model. This finding added to the literature on the importance of the demographic and socio-economic factor: as the third factor added in the model, it had an impact larger than those of the first and second factors added in the model, namely disaster-prone areas and psychological condition. (2) Risk perception had a larger impact than disaster experience on mitigation behaviors—whether the impact of disaster experience on mitigation behaviors was significant depended on the type of disaster. This result suggested that to encourage mitigation behaviors, actively raising people’s risk perception might be a better strategy than passively focusing on disaster experiences. (3) The factor of psychological condition could be an antecedent variable of mitigation behaviors. Experts or practitioners in the field of disaster management could plan how to integrate mental health services into the promotion of disaster mitigation behaviors. (4) Among all variables, education had the greatest impact on mitigation behaviors, which was an exciting result. This result might support the viewpoint of sociology of disasters which believes that education provides capability to absorb knowledge and obtain information of disaster mitigation behaviors. (5) The impact of the factor of family structure on mitigation behaviors was not significant. Unlike the results of previous studies, cohabiting people, especially school-age children, did not encourage family mitigation behaviors in Taiwan. Therefore, the practitioners must continue to work hard to meet their own expectation that school-age children bring home the knowledge they have acquired from school, thereby influencing their families to take disaster mitigation behaviors. The fact that families with access and functional needs did not have more mitigation behaviors than their counterparts suggested a disaster vulnerability in today’s aged society. (6) Social networks, the internet, and social media influenced the flood model but were not significant in the earthquake model. As there is still room for improvement, practitioners could learn to effectively use existing social mechanisms to promote and implement disaster mitigation behaviors in Taiwan, such as school-based and neighborhood-based disaster education and management, as well as social media.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=326,47,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
Modeling Multiple Inflations in Survey Data,"Ting Hsiang Lin, Min-Hsiao Tsai","truncated Poisson regression, multinomial logistic regression, zero-inflated Poisson","The Poisson (ZIP) regression model is used to analyze data with a Poisson distribution with excessive zeros. Although various models have been developed to fit zero-inflated data, many of them strongly depend on unique features of each data set. To be more specific, this means a sizable group of respondents endorsing the same answers, making the data have modes. For example, some data have cyclical patterns with multiple inflated values, such as survey questions which assess risk or health behaviors within a fixed length of time. Two examples are the question “During the past 30 days, on how many days did symptoms of asthma make it difficult for you to stay asleep?” and the question “During the past two weeks, on how many days did you text or e-mail while driving a car or other vehicle?” In this study, we proposed a new multiple-inflated truncated Poisson (MITP) regression model for more than two inflated values. The model is a combination of multinomial logistic regression and truncated Poisson regression, the multinomial logistic regression models the occurrence of excessive values, and the truncated Poisson regression models data following a truncated Poisson distribution. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through a simulation study. In the simulation study, we compared the performance of truncated Poisson (TP), zero-inflated truncated Poisson (ZITP), zero- and K-inflated Poisson (ZKIP) and multiple-inflated truncated Poisson (MITP) regression models under different simulation configurations. The factors considered include the model used to generate the data and the sample size. A likelihood ratio test was used to select the best model. We generated 1000 replications for each configuration. The accuracy rates of model selection via the likelihood ratio test and MAE (mean absolute error) were used to compare the performance of the models. In terms of MAE, when the hypothetical true model is TP, the means of the MAE of the four models do not have any substantial difference. When the hypothetical true model is ZITP, TP has the worst performance. When the hypothetical true model is ZKITP, TP and ZITP perform poorly, whereas the performance of ZKITP and MITP is much better. When the hypothetical true model is MITP, MITP has the best performance. From the results, MITP is the best model when there are multiple inflated points. ZKITP and MITP fit well when there are zero and K inflated points, while ZITP, ZKITP and MITP fit the data well when there are only inflated zero counts. When the data are truncated Poisson distributed, all four models fit the data well. With an increasing K-inflation rate, ZKITP and MITP have better and stable performance. With fixed sample sizes and parameters, when the true underlying model is truncated Poisson, MITP has the smallest MAE, followed by ZKITP, ZITP and TP. We analyzed a survey question, “On how many of the PAST 30 DAYS did you smoke cigarettes?” from the US’s National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) in the empirical study. In addition to typical days of the Poisson distribution (1, 2, 3, and 4 days), the data also have inflated values that are multiples of 5 and 7. The results indicate that the MITP model has smaller MAE, and MSE as well as better model fit, and outperformed competing models.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=328,47,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
Class Inequality of Moving: A Preliminary Study of Transportation-Related Lifestyle and the Risk of Traffic Accidents in Taiwan,"Thung-hong Lin, Keng-ming Hsu, Chun-yin Lee","class inequality, transport disadvantage, public transport accessibility, transport affordability, traffic accident","Transportation systems are critical infrastructure for all countries and provide mobility accessible to all. However, some people’s mobility and risks of transportation are more equal than others. In order to explain the inequality in transportation, studies have investigated transport affordability and public transport accessibility for people of different social classes. Yet, there has been little discussion about empirically investigating the relationship between social class and the risk of transportation accidents. In Taiwan, the high mortality rate of traffic accidents, especially involving motorcycles as the major mode of transport, has been publicly criticized for years. Therefore, we investigate the relationship between social classes, modes of transport, and the risks of traffic accidents in Taiwan. Three hypotheses are derived from the international literature and empirically tested with data from the 2019 Taiwan Social Change Survey. First, the social class of Taiwanese shaped their risk of car accidents. The lower classes such as workers and farmers were exposed to and suffered from higher risk of car accidents due to their longer driving time and distance resulting from their occupational and commuting needs. Second, people from lower classes in Taiwan tended to choose motorcycles as the major daily mode of transport because of their affordability, and using a motorcycle increased their risk of suffering from traffic accidents. Third, the lower accessibility of public transport services increased the probability of people using a motorcycle, and using a motorcycle increased the risk.For the sake of concentrating on this issue, we participated in the design of the 2019 Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS Round 7, Year 5): Technology and Risk Society. The questionnaire asked the major mode of transport and the frequency of car accidents the respondents had experienced during the last two decades. We merge two levels of data to break through the methodological limitations of the survey. The first level is the sampled data of socioeconomic status and traffic behavior in the TSCS. The second level measuring the accessibility of public transport services is the overall traffic development information, such as the densities of mass transport stations including railways, subways and buses of the township. From Poisson regression results, it can be seen that class inequality significantly affected an individual’s choice of whether to adopt mass transit, a motorcycle, or a car as their primary mode of transport in their daily lives. Motorcycles were the main form of transportation (53%) in Taiwan. What is more, the results indicated that employers tended to drive cars, unskilled workers, self-employed individuals (including farmers), and unemployed individuals tended to ride motorcycles, and individuals who are not in the workforce tended to walk or use mass transit. In addition, the motorcyclists were significantly more prone to accidents than respondents driving cars or taking mass transit. In fact, respondents living in an area of higher density with mass rapid transit (MRT) stations tended to use the MRT and had a lower likelihood of using motorcycles, and these respondents had a lower risk of car accidents. Most important of all, the research findings may serve as a guide for transport policymakers, that is, the risk of car accidents in Taiwan could be reduced by building MRT stations and by reducing class inequalities vis-à-vis moving, the urban–rural transport gap, and motorcycle ridership.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=329,47,2021,Survey Research - Method and Application
The Effects of Attention Checks on Item Response Latency and Questionnaire Completion,"Ruoh-Rong Yu, Su-Hao Tu","attention checks, online survey, survey experiment, response latency, questionnaire completion","Online surveys have become more prevalent due to the widespread use of the Internet and mobile devices. Because online survey data are collected by self-administered questionnaires, data quality is highly related to respondents’ attentiveness. Attention checks have been developed by researchers to identify inattentive respondents in online surveys by means of asking the respondents to respond according to the instructions of the question rather than their true answer. Even though passing an attention check was found to be associated with the respondent’s overall data quality, several researchers have argued that a respondent may feel uncomfortable or not trusted when he or she encounters an attention check question. However, only a few studies, mostly based on non-probability samples, have examined whether attention checks affect respondents’ subsequent behaviors. By conducting a survey experiment centered on a probability-based online panel, this study analyzes the effects of attention checks on the likelihood of dropping out from an online survey and the response latency to subsequent items. The sample used in this study is based on an online panel constructed by the Center for Survey Research, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. To examine whether the design and location of attention check questions matter for the respondents’ subsequent behaviors, we adopted a two-by-two experimental design in which there are two designs and two locations (former half and latter half) for attention check questions. This sample was randomly assigned to these four treatment groups and one additional control group (with no attention check questions).The theme of the online survey is the attitudes toward surveys and data. The online survey was conducted from April 19 to May 3, 2021. Invitation emails were sent successfully to 7,400 subjects. Among the 3,875 respondents, 3,770 completed the questionnaires. A logit model and Cox proportional hazard model were used to analyze the effects of attention checks on the probability of withdrawal. A multilevel mixed-effects generalized linear model was applied to estimate the impact of an attention check on response latency of subsequent items. Possible outliers of response latency were identified and treated in different ways as a robustness check. The results indicate that adding an attention check to a questionnaire does not matter for the probability of withdrawal. This finding is intact with regards to the design or location of attention checks. Our findings also reveal that attention checks located in the latter half of a questionnaire have positively significant effects on the response latency of subsequent items, yet the attention checks placed in the former half are insignificant. The findings on response latency are robust to different ways of identifying and treating outliers. In sum, our results indicate that even though attention checks are not associated with the probability of completing a questionnaire, their locations are important for whether respondents’ attentiveness can be effectively elevated. Despite our finding that attention checks did not provoke negative behaviors such as quitting the questionnaire or speeding up the response time, a preliminary analysis on response latency to attention checks reveals that the respondents who failed an attention check spent more time in responding to the attention check than those who passed. Responding behaviors to the attention check itself deserve further exploration in future research.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=332,48,2022,Survey Research - Method and Application
"Teacher Caring, Influence of Student Societies, School Activities and Delinquency","Ming-Ying Lu, Feng-Ming Chang, Ling-Ling Kueh, Yuk-Ying Tung","delinquency, social control theory, zero-inflated negative binomial regression","Hirschi’s social control theory implies that when students lack a sense of attachment or identity, or dislike participating in school activities, deviations or criminal behavior might occur. We hypothesize that the effects of school factors should play important roles in the explanation of youth delinquency. If teenagers have negative relationships with teachers, or dislike going to school, these are likely to result in the occurrence of deviant behavior. Few empirical studies have analyzed the influencing factors that trigger the “occurrence” of delinquency, and whether relevant factors have an effect on the “frequency” of the occurrence of deviant behavior. Therefore, this study attempted to examine the impact and influence which teacher caring, student societies and school activities have on the occurrence and frequency of delinquent behavior by using the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model. Adopting the dynamic change development and life course interpretation perspective allowed us to explore the causes of various developmental aspects of adolescents’ deviant behavior.The study utilized data collected from 4,056 high school, technical high school and five-year junior college program students in Taiwan under the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS) published in 2007. The database was planned and funded by Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education in Taiwan. TEPS was the first database in Taiwan to sample and collect long-term data from junior high school, high school, vocational high school and five-year junior college students across the country. Deviant behavior usually occurred beyond normality and routine. The actual situation was much more complex and unlikely to present itself in a normal statistical distribution. The occurrence of deviant behavior in a group is relatively rare. Consequently, it tends to be unique and occur in complex situations, rather than being normal or routine, as a result, it is difficult to identify in normal statistical distributions. Therefore, the use of behavioral types or continuous values cannot reflect the true situation of deviation behavior. In order to overcome the excessive dispersion and heterogeneity caused by a large number of “zeros” in the data, this study utilized the zero-inflated negative binomial regression model (ZINB) in statistical analysis. Through ZINB analysis, first, based on the number of occurrences of deviant behavior among adolescents, students were divided into susceptible groups and non-susceptible groups. Then, for the susceptible groups, a negative binomial regression model was further used to test the impact of independent variables on deviant behavior.The major findings of this study were as follows: (1) The influence which teacher caring, student societies and school activities had on students was not significantly associated with the occurrence of delin quency. However, students who experienced a higher level of teacher caring and more positive experiences in student societies and school activities appeared to have a lower frequency of delinquency. (2) Gender was significantly associated with the occurrence and frequency of delinquency, such that male students showed higher levels of occurrence and frequency of delinquency than female students. (3) Students from townships showed a lower level of occurrence of delinquent behavior than those from cities. (4) Students from comprehensive high schools showed a higher level of frequency of delinquent behavior than those from normal high schools. Based on the research results, this paper concludes with suggestions of applied counseling work references for schools and teachers and possible directions that future research may take.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=334,48,2022,Survey Research - Method and Application
Using the Choice Experiment to Assess Payment for Forest Ecosystem Services under Land-Use Change,"Chih-Pei Shen, Ching Chuang, Wan-Yu Liu","payment for ecosystem services, ecosystem services, fallow land, bared land, areca garden","The rapid changing of the environment and climate has raised awareness of global environmental issues. In addition, more and more countries have established programs, policies, and strategies related to the environment. Among these programs, Payment of Ecosystem Services (PES) plays a significant role. In the programs of PES, Land-Use Change could also change the quantity and the quality of Ecosystem Services. There has been much research investigating the Ecosystem Evaluation, especially in forest ecosystem services, however, up to now little research has been conducted on the payment of land use change among the PES programs. Therefore, this research focuses on the land use changing payment of forest Ecosystem Services. Using areca garden, bare land and fallow land as research objects, this study evaluates the ecosystem service value of biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and pest control under different Land-Use Change conditions. In this study, the forest Ecosystem Services under Land-Use Change are regarded as a situation undergoing multi-faceted change, so the Choice Experiment is used. Compared with the case of using the Contingent Valuation Method, the main assumption is to query the willingness to pay for each attribute separately. The Choice Experiment is selected to measure the marginal benefit when the attribute level of the natural environment is changed, so it is easier to assess the value of the degree of change of each attribute. The questionnaires for this study were distributed online, using quota sampling and snowball sampling. The distribution of the questionnaires was based on regions. The distribution was conducted from July 2018 to September 2018. A total of 463 copies were issued to respondents in Taiwan, of which 452 were deemed as valid questionnaires. According to the results, considering the situation of the land use changing from areca garden to afforestation, the upper limit of PES per hectare per year is 24,862 NTD, and the conservative estimated upper limitation of PES is 1,060,654,695 NTD per year, considering the situation of the land use changing from bare land to afforestation, the upper limit of PES per hectare per year is 122,823 NTD, and the conservative estimated upper limitation of PES is 8,742,208,887 NTD per year, considering the situation of the land use changing from fallow land to afforestation, the upper limit of PES per hectare per year is 14,371 NTD, while the conservative estimated upper limitation of PES is 695,243,950 NTD per year. Furthermore, according to the results, gender, residential area, individual income, the awareness of PES and the environmental attitude all influence the respondents’ willingness to pay and the preference. According to this research, the following three items are offered to the government: (1) the government should integrate the new compensation programs with the previous programs, (2) the government should provide compensation to landowners when the land use changes from areca land to afforestation in mountainous areas, (3) the government should pay more attention to pest disease protection, which is considered one of the most significant and influential ecosystem services. The results of this research could be applied to future government land use changing PES programs and strategies.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=335,48,2022,Survey Research - Method and Application
Estimating Scale Values of Response Anchors in Likert-type Scales,Hsiu-Ting Yu,"Likert-type scale, scale labels, psychological scale values, survey research","Social science and psychological research often uses questionnaires or scales to collect data. Likert-type scales are the most commonly used scales in questionnaires or scales when collecting data. The psychological scale values of the scale labels/descriptors/anchors have important implications in the analysis and interpretation of data. Different methods and formats have been proposed for estimating the scale values of a Likert-type scale. Previous studies have used successive interval and simplified successive interval estimation methods. Studies have also used an open-response format and category-level assigning format to study the scale values. However, there is no consensus and still a lack of studies comparing different estimation methods. In this study, three estimation methods of label scale values are investigated: the paired-comparison method, direct rating method, and simultaneous ranking evaluation method. Three common types of scale labels are investigated in this study: agreement-, conformity-, and frequency-type. A review on the usages of Likert scale labels in literature was conducted, 24 agreement-type labels, 24 conformity-type labels, and 20 frequency-type labels were included in this study. There were 97 subjects (27 males and 70 females) who participated in this study. The mean age of the subjects is 20.68 years old with a SD of 1.54. The subjects took part in lab experiments with three tasks. In the direct rating task, subjects used a mouse to drag a marker on a horizontal bar to indicate the rating of a given label stimulus. In the pair-comparison task, subjects used the mouse to drag a marker on a horizontal bar to indicate the degree of difference of a given pair of labels. In the simultaneous ranking evaluation task, subjects were presented with all the labels on the top panel of the screen and the subjects’ task was to drag these labels in any order they preferred to any location on the horizontal bar located in the center of the screen. Subjects could adjust the location of any label on the horizontal bar before they clicked the “confirm” button to submit their answer. Subjects’ responses to the three tasks were recorded on a 0-1000 scale for further analysis. The collected data were analyzed and compared the psychological scale values estimated by the three estimation methods. The results suggested the equal space assumption between points on the Likert scale is in general not hold based on the estimated scale values of this study. The results also suggested substantial differences among the three estimation methods. Moreover, the estimated scale values of the selected labels were also not evenly distributed on the evaluation scale, more labels were loaded toward the extreme portion of the scale. The possible explanations for this observation are discussed in the discussion section. Since it is difficult to locate appropriate labels based on the estimated psychological scale values on a Likert-type scale, we suggested using only the “end-label” on a Likert scale in practice, for example, “completely disagree- completely agree” and “never-always” as the labels on a Likert-type scale. The limitations of the present study were presented in the discussion section as well as references for further reading on these topics. Other psychometric methods such as item-response theory (IRT) and Fuzzy Linguistic/numbers approach for dealing with Likert-type scale labels were also discussed in the concluding remarks.",https://www.rchss.sinica.edu.tw/SRMA/app/paper.php?action=show_content&Sn=336,48,2022,Survey Research - Method and Application
Expressing Nationalist Politics in Guestworker Program: Taiwan's Recruitment of Foreign Labor,Yen-Fen Tseng,"foreign worker policy, guestworker program, nationalist politics, nationalism, class, Taiwan","This article argues that introducing and implementing a foreign workers policy offers an opportunity for a modern state to express its very fundamental ideologies related to nationalist politics. By investigating the policy making decisions that formulate the first ever guestworker program in Taiwan during the early 1990s, in this article, I pursue a dual analytical agenda. First, I examine in detail the nationalist discourse on building the foreign worker regime in Taiwan and show how some fundamental ideal interests related to nationalist politics influence the decision making process. Second, I aim to show how a restrictive border control policy such as guest worker program expresses some of the Taiwan's key nationalist narratives in the early 1990s. Major findings are as followed. First, operating under the idea of​​ mercantilist economic nationalism, the guestworker program was meant to respond to a “shortage” of low-skilled labor constructed by industries threatening plant closings and offshore production. Second, the careful selection of foreign workers from specific countries reflects state-to-state relations in international politics. Third, racialized classism is found in related policies that basically give more room for incorporating professional/technician/managerial workers to Taiwan's demographic future. Blue collared workers from Southeast Asia are classified as a cultural race and are perceived “incompatible” with Taiwan. Forth, the state resists the market demand for mainland Chinese labors, who are considered an ideal labor supply due to their assumed language and cultural commonness, stemming from a fear of having the recently consolidated national identity be shaken up once again.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=96&blog_id=340,32,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

In other words, the State has understood the linkages between globalization sovereignty and border control as primarily represented by the “problems” transnational marriage brings about. Based on materials of in-depth interviews and fieldwork research, this paper means to highlight the fact that the younger generation of “Mainland brides,” ie, the “foreign brides” of Chinese origin, construct their agency in the initial stage of migration mostly on a specific mode of imagination for modernity. It highlights as well how in most cases such a form of social agency is later thwarted by the patrilineal rule of marital house hold a s well as the strict immigration regulation concerning their citizen’s rights.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=96&blog_id=339,32,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Utilizing Multiethnic Resources in Multinational Corporations: Taiwan-Based Firms in Silicon Valley,Ruey-Ling Tzeng,"Social capital, embeddendness, guanxi, interpersonal networks, multinational corporations","Using Adler and Kwon's concept of social capital, the author explains how Taiwan-based firms operating in California's Silicon Valley are making full use of multiethnic resources to break into mainstream American markets. According to information gathered through interviews with representatives from 38 Taiwan-based firms , these companies employ Chinese Americans or contract Chinese-led service firms for “back room” operations (eg, business logistics) while hiring Caucasian Americans or contracting Caucasian-led firms or “front room” positions (eg, management, marketing, and sales ). In Adler and Kwon's terminology, these companies are using bonding social capital for daily operations and bridging social capital to enter the mainstream American economy. The research also asserts that a) Chinese-American employees are increasingly capable of providing bridging social capital due to their bilingual ad bicultural skills; b) Taiwan-based firms in Silicon Valley tend to use personal netwo rks to identify potential Caucasian employees , favoring candidates with previous experience working with Asians or those who are older and more mature in order to ensure a certain degree of bonding social capital; and c) the ethnic compositions of employee bases and the ethnic backgrounds of executives in individual Taiwan-based firms in Silicon Valley are evolving. This reflects changing patterns in social networks and the willingness and ability of companies to accept multiethnic management as a potential asset leading to greater profitability.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=96&blog_id=337,32,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Differential Grade Attainment by Men and Women in a Bureaucratic Labor Market,"Ly-Yun Chang, Yuan-Chieh Chuang","Internal labor market, civil servants, career development, gender","This paper addresses the issue of the under-representation of women in the upper echelon of the governments in Taiwan. The empirical focus is the grade attainment of civil servants in 1986. Drawing on a new 20% random sample (13,925 cases) of the 1986 civil servants in the administrative branch, we compare and evaluate different sources of the gender gap in current grad (the grade level of 1986) – education, grade level of te initial job, administrative level of the initial agency, and cumulative tenure in civil service . Six central findings are obtained. (1) Although the grade attainment process increasingly becomes bureaucratized, net gender gap on current grade attainment remains significant. (2) The gender gap in current grade is mainly due to differences between men and women in initial grade and tenure. Difference between men and women in initial grade is most important factor explaining gender gap on grade. (3) Most of the gender gap on initial grade remains unexplained by diffe rence between men and women on education, categories of job ladder, and initial administrative hierarchy. (4) Men invest more than women on educational upgrading. Training and studying have positive effect on current grade attainment. Difference on training and studying between men and women is more important than difference on educational credentials between men and women in explaining gender gap on current grade attainment. (5) As expected, education, initial grade, initial administrative level and tenure have positive effects on grade achievement. The positive effects on grade achievement are lower for women than for men depending on levels of educational credentials, initial grades, and categories of job ladders. (6) Women's deficits on current and initial grade attainment changed over time. The largest gender gap on current grade is observed among the senior group, the smallest is among the middle group, while the junior group is in between. Although the findings of this study are consistent with an organizational-centered perspective on stratification, differential effects of organizational variables do not provide a convincing explanation for the gender gap on current grade attainment.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=96&blog_id=336,32,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Fertility Implication and Estimate of Cohabitation in Taiwan,Ching-Li Yang,"cohabitation, fertility, reference person, artner, census","In most Western countries cohabitation began when marriage rates declined. The marriage rate in Taiwan is declining while the prevalence of cohabitation is still ambiguous. This paper clarifies the fertility implication of cohabitation and estimates the number of cohabitation in Taiwan. There estimates of cohabiting persons, 203720, 379776, and 440508, which were based on 2 approaches by using the census 2000 data set, were proposed. Even though the highest estimate, it is likely to be underestimated amid the Taiwan’s background of marriage postponement, popular pre-marital sex, and higher proportion of leaving parental home. To getting better cohabitation information, a questionnaire strategy was suggested.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=96&blog_id=335,32,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
The Female Gaze: Playing with Self-Image and Wedding Photography,Yu Ying Lee,"male gaze, portrait photography, wedding photography, visual culture, identity","The author criticizes the assumption that all images of women are made for men-that is, they are supposed to flatter the male gaze. According to feminist critiques, women's appearances are coded for strong visual and erotic impact that connotes 'to-be-looked-at-ness.' Empirical data on the consumption practices of Taiwanese wedding photographs suggest that women can act as the lookers. Women not only gain pleasure in seeing their own images, but also from their desire to be seen. That women want to be the visual center indicates that they seek to display a 'social being' to be admired by others. Accordingly, women create images that are not meant to please male gazes so much as to create their own pleasure. The author also argues that female subjectivity is acquired through learning-to-look as well as learning-to-be-looked at.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=95&blog_id=329,33,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"The Body Experience of Taiwanese Cancer Patients: Illness, Death, and the Power of the Medical Profession",Yu-Yueh TSAI,"body, body image, illness, medical professional power, hospice","The author synthesizes the micro and macro levels of illness and analyzes how cancer patients experience illness under the influence of modern medicine. Using data from participant observations and/or interviews with 36 Taiwanese cancer patients, the paper focuses on how modern medical, cultural, and social factors shape experiences of diseased bodies. Also examined are the new ”administrative technology of body” in contemporary society, changes in body images and self-identities, relationships between diseased bodies and the power of the medical profession, and ”body politics” in hospice treatment. The results show that a) individual experiences of cancer differ, and b) modern medicine and cultural and social factors play important roles in shaping such experiences. The limitations of modern medicine in dealing with chronic and incurable diseases are also discussed. The final issue analyzed in this paper concerns the possibility of cancer patients achieving autonomy in dealing with their illnesses within the confines of modem medical practices. The author argues that patients can impart new meanings to their suffering and that alternative agencies can arise, but only when they recognize the limitations of modem medicine and understand how medical, cultural, and social factors regulate their bodies.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=95&blog_id=328,33,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Pathways to Large-scale Hospital Director and Physician Labor Markets,Duan-Rung Chen,"physician labor market, hospital directors, career lines","About two-thirds of all Taiwanese physicians are employed in large hospitals, making it increasingly difficult for general physicians to move into a limited number of high-level managerial positions, including hospital CEO positions. The author examines factors associated with getting managerial positions in large-scale hospitals, based on data gathered from 90 such institutions throughout Taiwan. A dataset on physician job history is examined and matched to determine the career patterns of managerial physicians at these institutions. The results show that these physicians are primarily males in their late 40s and early 50s with degrees from highly selective medical schools. Other factors associated with physicians in managerial positions include surgical backgrounds and career patterns focused on public hospitals. Some of these results can be explained by the signaling effect of prestigious medical schools, while others can be attributed to strong institutional links between prestigious school-based hospitals and other hospitals. The physician labor market is characterized by segmentation and clustering. Success factors associated with physicians in managerial positions are different for different market segments, indicating that an organization's market stance exerts an influence on internal employee promotion mechanisms.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=95&blog_id=327,33,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Culture, Framing and Social Movement",Ming-Sho Ho,"framing, culture, social movement, strategy","The author offers a review of studies on social movement framing. Framing is defined as a) a collective process for building a shared interpretative schema for the outside world, and b) the means by which social movements produce cultural meanings. This paper traces the interactionist standpoint used by David Snow and his colleagues to establish their framing theory. In the early phase, framing studies primarily focused on small circles of potential supporters and their capacity to create a consensus. Earlier studies tended to under-theorize the strategic and organizational dimensions of framing. In more recent scholarly works, framing can be conceptualized as making use of political opinions, maintaining participant morale, and avoiding resistance. Recent studies also show the extent to which framing is subject to organizational processes such as competition, cooperation, and learning. While endorsing the strategic aspects of framing theory, this review also warns against excessive voluntarism. Rationality in framing is bounded by the actors' biographies, histories, and pre-existing cultural repertoires. If some conceptual difficulties can be resolved, framing theory is a promising explanatory approach to relations between social movement and culture.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=95&blog_id=326,33,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
A Comparison of Labor Time Estimates between Diaries and Direct Questions: An Example of Married Women in the Flower Production Industry,Su-Hao Tu,"time diaries, stylized direct questions, social desirability, time-pressure perceptions, regression to the mean","In the West, time estimates between direct questions and time diaries have long been debated in sociological and economic analyses of household labor and market labor; no similar studies have been conducted in Taiwan. The author interviewed self-employed married women in the flower production industry to examine differences in estimates of unpaid labor time between time diaries and direct questions. Survey and ethnographic data were used to validate the time diaries by investigating differences in diary estimates between weekdays and weekends, overestimates from direct questions, and possible explanations for overestimates. The results generally support the idea that time-diaries-keeping is an appropriate means of measuring labor time. The participants who reported long work hours tended to exaggerate their time spent on farm and household tasks. Given the divergent findings on social-psychological effects in a small sample of farm women, the results demonstrate a good frame of reference for subsequent methodological studies, particularly those related to lifestyle, time-use, and gender divisions in markets and household labor. The study limitations point to a need for revising measures of social desirability, refining analytical models of overestimates, conducting more research on time diary reliability and validity, making comparative analyses of multiple methods for time data collection, and replicating past studies using a representative national sample and longitudinal design.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=95&blog_id=325,33,2004,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Stratified Otherization: Recruitment, Training and Racialization of Migrant Domestic Workers",Pei-Chia Lan,"racialization, Otherization, migrant worker, domestic worker, recruitment agency","Racialization is a social process through which groups are marked by physical or cultural differences that become naturalized as essential. The author looks at the racialization of migrant domestic workers in Taiwan with a focus on employment agency discourses and practices. Taiwan has recently witnessed a decline in the recruitment of Filipina maids and a consequent increase in the number of Indonesian maids. This paper analyzes hidden reasons behind the ethnic stratification of these groups, in particular, the tendency of recruitment agents to establish differences between ”unruly Filipinas” and ”docile Indonesians” to rationalize market segmentation and hierarchical labor conditions. Those agencies also actively produce ”ideal servants” by a) purposefully recruiting young female villagers subject to local network control; b) ”civilizing” and ”modernizing” these women through training; and c) representing migrant women as de-feminized and suitable servants through the management of d ress codes, hairstyles, and personality.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=94&blog_id=321,34,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

As hospitals become more aware of their managerial power, the influence of doctors to make specific prescription decisions is being limited in terms of restricting categories and stocking/auditing pharmacy items. At the same time, pharmaceutical companies are using diverse strategies to influence physician choices, offering substantial incentives to large hospitals that provide greater profit compared to small hospitals and local clinics. According to the new Taiwanese model, doctors' prescription decisions are not always based on professional standards but on organizational factors. The medical system allows pharmaceutical companies to fulfill the self-interests of doctors via a combination of professional and non-professional marketing tactics, putting prescription quality in doubt.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=94&blog_id=320,34,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
The Division of Household Labor in Taiwan: Economic Dependence and Gender,Ying-Ling Hsiao,"division of household labor, economic dependence, gender","According to the literature, three main theoretical perspectives on the process of household labor allocation are gender role, time availability, and relative resources. The author examines the effects of the three perspectives’ determinants and of gender display on the relationship between economic dependence and housework. The data used in the study came from a national sample of married people (n=1,874; 977 men, 897 women). Individual and household characteristics were controlled for in regression analyses of factors related to male/female proportions of housework. The results show greater support for the relative resources and gender role perspectives than for the time availability model. The results also indicate a linear (as opposed to curvilinear) relationship between economic dependence and the respective proportions of housework performed by married men an women. These findings suggest that the link between housework and economic dependence complies with rules of economic exchange rather than gender display or deviance neutralization processes.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=94&blog_id=319,34,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"A Critical Review of Problems Associated with Population and Labor Migration in Taiwan, 1980-2000",Ji-Ping Lin,"population migration, labor migration, internal migration, international migration, regional and urban development","Using a combination of the existing literature and the author's long-term research on migration patterns, this article presents a critical review of the socioeconomic problems associated with population and labor migration to and from Taiwan during the past two decades. Population and labor migration apparently aggravate human resource distribution in terms of quantity and quality, in spite of its positive role in efficient manpower redistribution. A movement toward more openness with and greater circulation of labor market information is an effective means of reducing migration redundancy and the undesirable effects of marginal labor migration. In terms of international migration, problems triggered by the importation of low-skilled foreign labor are more crucial than those associated with the immigration of foreign brides and the emigration of Taiwanese workers to China. Conflicts and contradictions between internal and international migration are manifested via the negative impacts of immigrant workers on employment opportunities for and internal migration of Taiwanese domestic laborers.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=94&blog_id=316,34,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

The authors review recent studies of this ”new economy”, focusing on researchers who have adopted institutional approaches to identify four keys to Taiwan's recent economic successes: firm scale enlargement, a dense learning network among high-tech firms, a system of local knowledge derived from firms and research institutes, and strong state policy support. We used the ideal type of new economy as a conceptual tool to contrast Taiwan's situation with those in fully industrialized societies, and found several weaknesses in the country's new economy in terms of the possession of critical scientific knowledge and the limited role of venture capital in initiation high-tech firms. Furthermore, Taiwan's new economy (as a capitalist mode production) has succeeded in accumulating profits but has been less successful regarding social distribution.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=94&blog_id=315,34,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Some measures are considered controversial, yet they are already exerting significant impacts on social science research. Two attributes of social science knowledge that form viewpoints on the sociology of knowledge are discussed in this paper, with the main argument being that all social science knowledge is reflexive in essence, and any discourse of knowledge legitimacy can only be reconstructed when social science knowledge fulfills the requirements of openness and publicness. Finally, I argue that in order to narrow the gap between social science knowledge and the world we live in, we must improve our academic environment by increasing our appreciation of multiple, critical, and reflexive values in order to win the public trust.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=93&blog_id=311,35,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Arthur Lewis' theory of unlimited labor supply to develop a dualistic economic model addressing the contradictory relationship between rice and sugar production in colonial Taiwan. According to the proposed model, the distribution of Japanese sugar profits and indigenous cane farmer income was determined by the subsistence levels of indigenous rice farmers. The conflict of interests pitted Japanese sugar capital against indigenous farmers. This contrasts with economist explanations of the rice-sugar rivalry that are constrained by the ill-founded argument of farmland competition between rice and cane production and thus fail to capture the essential character of the colonial economy.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=93&blog_id=310,35,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Discovering the Trends and Structures of Institutional Trust: The Pooled Ordinal Ratings Approach,"Ly-Yun Chang, Tony Tam","institutional trust, personal trust, ordered logistic regression, Taiwan social change","To advance the quantitative study of trust, we propose the pooled ordinal ratings approach as a versatile measurement and modeling framework. Based on ordered logistic regression model originally designed for panel data, the proposed strategy makes much better use of the available data and allows more penetrating analysis of central questions than are possible with conventional descriptive techniques. For illustration, we apply the approach to a large pooled data set drawn from 35 surveys conducted in Taiwan over 14 years. Four major findings were obtained: (1) The trust placed by the public in Taiwanese institutions has undergone a steady decline between 1990 and 2003, a trend not evident for trust in natural persons; (2) In descending order, the most trusted institutions are professional roles, non-profit organizations, for-profit organizations, institutional system, the government, and official positions; (3) Types of institutional failure (particularly remedial mechanism) can statistically explain why the public trust non-profit and for-profit more than government organizations, and trust non-profit more than for-profit organizations; and (4) Relative to trust in natural persons, overall institutional trust is low except when compared to trust in strangers.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=93&blog_id=309,35,2005,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Changes in Friendship Boundaries across Ethnic Groups in Taiwan between 1970 and 1997,"Yih-Jyh Hwang, Ying-Hwa Chang","ethnic friendship boundary, residential segregation, macro-structural change","Results from studies on inter-ethnic relations indicate increases in educational and occupational segregation among ethnic groups and decreases in friendship choices across ethnic lines. Data also show that educational, occupational, and residential segregation in Taiwan has decreased dramatically among sub-ethnic groups based on provincial affiliations. We examined changes in friendship boundaries across ethnic lines using log linear and multiplicative analyses of island-wide surveys conducted in 1970 and 1997. Our findings show that choice of friends across sub-ethnic groups has actually increased substantially, with changing boundaries of ethnic friendships resulting from decreases in residential, educational, and occupational segregation. However, the data indicate that members of the Hakka ethnic group are less inclined to make friends with members of other sub-ethnic groups, perhaps due to their restricted distribution to a few Taiwanese counties.

Contemporary Predicaments of Group Life: A Partial View of the Future of Taiwan's Civil Society via the Grade 1-9 Social Studies Curriculum,Horng-Luen Wang,"educational reform, modularity, civility, moral life, modernity and postmodernity","This article explores the potential impact of recent educational reforms on the future of civil society in Taiwan by examining the ”Social Studies Learning Area” in the controversial ”Grade 1-9 Curriculum.” Widely recognized as a modern model for group life, civil society can only be realized on the preconditions of ”modularity” and ”civility” as cultivated by education. Mass education, institutionalized by the nation-state is part of the rationalist ”modernity project” that makes civil society possible. However, the Grade 1-9 Curriculum in question has been characterized by strong ”postmodern” orientations that emphasize such features as anti-rationalism, de-centering, anti-metanarrative, multiplicity, and pleasure, among others. By evoking subjects of new kinds that differ radically from the older model of ”modern person,” the irrational and non-rational aspects of these postmodern orientations are making the preconditions of civil society untenable, while moral foundations of group life are being undermined. What group life will look like in the future deserves further attention.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=92&blog_id=304,36,2006,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Masculinity in Taiwan's Labor Union Movement,Ming-Sho Ho,"union movement, masculinity, patriarchy, class","The author analyzes why the Taiwanese labor union movement presents highly militant masculinity on two levels. Masculinities are a relational social organization. A specific form of masculinity arises from a specific environment and brings about effects on gender politics. Historically speaking, Taiwan's workers have been deprived of critical traditions that could have sustained their protests, since authoritarianism brought about mass amnesia concerning previous waves of radicalism. Workers have had but relied on the most primordial common maleness in order to maintain and strengthen their solidarity. In terms of labor organization, patriarchal expectations of male superiority stand in stark contrast to the reality of class domination, at least in state-owned enterprises. Class division consequently castrated male workers. Without dignity, they were reduced to what they perceived as a feminine existence, and thus relied on collective action to express their suppressed manhood.

Labor Force Participation of the Boss's Wife: Bringing the Family Strategy Back in,Yu-Hsia LU,"Family business, married women's labor force participation, family economic strategy, informal sector, non-wage family worker","The author uses results from a survey of 335 small businesses owned and operated by families across Taiwan to examine mechanisms underlying the labor-force participation of owners' wives. The family strategies consistent with the principle of maximum profit within a capitalist economy serve as the basis for analyzing the marginal utility of wives' labor-force status and to test hypotheses regarding their labor-force participation determinants. The findings indicate that participation status is shaped by a combination of production organization, family organization, labor market and human capital factors. Wives are more likely to work in family businesses when labor processes focus on tasks considered as commonly executed by females, when their families have extended family structures, when they have preschool-aged children, and when business location and dwelling space are the same or very close. Labor market opportunities exert a positive effect on their working outside of family businesses. Wives with higher levels of education tend to either work outside of family businesses or to stay as housewives. Those wives with egalitarian attitudes toward gender roles tend to work both inside and outside of their family businesses. Combined, the findings suggest that the labor force participation of bosses' wives is only partly explained by the maximum-profit family-strategy.

The five subjective classes are latent upper-middle class, latent middle class, latent lower-middle class, latent working class, and latent lower class. Different labor market and workplace experiences, objective classes, and status positions tend to generate different perceptions between men and women regarding social class positions.

Tzu-Chi's rapid growth parallels the global emergence of public religion. However, Tzu-Chi's ideas of ”publicness”(gong) differ in important respects from Casanova's ideas of ”public religion” and then Western bourgeois-based ”public sphere” Tzu-Chi's public model is attained through the personal ”somatic realization” of moral value that potentially leads to a cooperative and peaceful community. It is therefore possible to label Tzu-Chi a ”somatic model” of civil engagement, in contrast to the ”discursive models” of the Western public sphere and Casanova's public religion. From Tzu-Chi’s sociogenesis we see that ”alternate traditionality” is more appropriate than ”alternate civility” for delineating its collective social participation.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=90&blog_id=288,38,2007,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Culture, Law and Strategy: Settlement Processes of a District Mediation Committee",Shaw-Wu JUNG,"legal anthropology, mediation, dispute process, local justice","The author uses settlement sessions at a Taiwan District Mediation Committee to analyze the extent to which law encompasses local customs and the ways that the articulation of law and customs formulate people's conceptions of justice and rights. Putting individual cases in a broader and more complete context allows for an examination of the cultural meanings manifested in continuous interactions between law and customs as well as ways that participants instrumentally utilize objective rules to accomplish their strategic goals. The argument is made that the legal processes as practiced by District Mediation Committees are constitutive of local knowledge, since such Committees are spaces where the social and legal spheres meet and where participants translate their expectations of the legal system into locally shared values. The author also investigates how legal concepts such as rules and justice are put into practice, and argues that rules are not objectively promulgated with obvious and clear connotations, but invoked and counterpoised by the participants' arguments and counterarguments. Rules emerge during the processes of restatement and reiteration.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=90&blog_id=287,38,2007,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Event History Analysis of Career Path Change From Hospital to Self-employment among Taiwanese Doctors,"Duan-Rung Chen, Kuo-Tung Fan","physicians, medical education, career path, career change","Physician career path types and hazard factors related to changing from hospital employment to self-employment in clinics are explored. The main study question is how the stratified structure of the medical job market formed by the long-term development of a political economy affects physicians' mid-and late-period career moves from hospitals to clinics; the effects of specialty choices are also considered. In addition to examining the effects of early status attainment on late career moves, we analyze physician job change data provided by Taiwan's Department of Health between 1988 and 2002. The data indicate that 6,111 physicians (internal medicine, surgery, obstetric and gynecologic, pediatric, and orthopedic specialists) started their practices between 1988 and 1995. Results from a COX proportional hazards model show that 1,293 of these physicians (21.2%) chose self-employment in office-based clinics after an average of 5.3 years (SD=2.43) of hospital employment. Four types of job change patterns were identified: stable, mobile, transformative and chaotic, with mobile being the most prevalent. Early status attainment variables were found to affect mid-and late-career moves, with the long-standing structure of stratification in this specific labor market also affecting physician career choices. Stratification is manifested in the form of school schisms, hospital stratification, and separate medical education tracks.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=90&blog_id=286,38,2007,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Taiwanese Household Projection Scenarios, 1990-2050","Ching-Li Yang, Yi-Jhen Dong","household composition, multi-dimensional household projection model, base population, standard schedules, summary measures","The authors use a multi-dimensional household projection model to project the number and composition of family households in Taiwan to the year 2050 to explore the impacts of population change and intergenerational co-residency on household composition. We also make comparisons between the results of the country's 2000 projection effort and registration/census to evaluate the model’s accuracy. Due to the projected numbers are more close to the registered total population in 2000 and the surveyed household composition in 2002, this projection maybe more reliable than the 2000 census. Three scenarios of long-term household projection are offered to demonstrate population and household trends. Our findings indicate that due to a sub-replacement fertility rate since the early 1980s, single generation households will dramatically increase starting 2020, with increases in elderly households making substantial contributions to growth in this category regardless of scenario. It holds important implications for implementing and operating a national pension and other long-term care programs. At the same time, the number of single-parent households will increase sharply due to the growing divorce rate, especially since the probability of divorced Taiwanese women remarrying is much lower than that for men.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=90&blog_id=284,38,2007,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
When Social Reproduction Fails: Explaining the Decreasing Ethnic Gap in Taiwan,"Kuo-Hsien Su, Wei-Hsin Yu","Ethnic inequality, ethnic homophily, cultural capital","The postwar influx of migrants from Mainland China—“Mainlanders” — rapidly and significantly increased ethnic diversity in Taiwan. Previous research comparing their socioeconomic attainments with those of native Taiwanese—“Islanders”—has consistently identified the first group’s advantages. However, such ethnic differences have apparently decreased over time. Factors commonly used to explain Taiwan’s ethnic inequality generally fail to account for the Mainlanders’ inability to reproduce their socioeconomic advantages across generations. In this paper we focus on the question of why ethnic gaps in education and occupational status have narrowed or closed over time. Using TSCS data collected over several years, we first demonstrate how the two groups have converged in terms of years of education and first occupation status. Next, we use the population census to examine ethnic segregation by college major and occupation, and report that Mainlanders are more likely than Islanders to major in the humanities. Our analysis of a separate set of TEPS data suggests that this is a result of the Mainlanders’ comparative advantage in language skills. Consistent with their choice of major, Mainlanders are also less likely to hold jobs that are conducive to “rent-generating”assets. We therefore argue that the cultural and linguistic affinity, plus the higher concentration of public sector workers among early generation Mainlanders living on Taiwan, have all affected their descendents’ strategies for both educational and commercial success. As an unintended consequence, occupational segregation by ethnicity has accelerated the equalization process, thereby accounting for (at least in part) the convergence and possible reversal of trends in educational and occupational inequalities.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=89&blog_id=280,39,2007,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

I start with a description of “objective”population transformation theory and explain why the Taiwanese transformation process was condensed. The current literature does not provide a satisfactory explanation for this condensation because the state role was not well-considered. Next, I explore subtle changes in family policy promoted by the KMT government and report the finding that American geo-political strategy in East Asia was the driving force behind the Taiwanese family plan.

The current high domestic price of Taiwanese tea is a result of monopoly power and a product of social construction. By presenting a carefully selected history and making claims of a special style, “Taiwan-Oolong tea”established monopoly rent in the 1980s. Beginning in the 1990s,“high-altitude tea”replaced the Taiwan-Oolong concept, thereby extracting more monopoly rent through claims of special physical qualities.

Development and Significance of Post-dated Check Credit in Postwar Taiwan,Pao-An Lin,"post-dated check, penalty, clearinghouse, credit, financing","In an unfavorable environment of financial repression, Taiwan achieved incredible economic performance—enough to have it described as a post-war “economic miracle.”This raises the question of how the economic actors met their financial needs to make their fortunes. The argument presented in this paper is that post-dated checks—a type of transaction imported from post- war Shanghai—were critical in their use as credit instruments. A combination of the banking system, check clearinghouses, and the justice system formed the institutional bases for a post-dated-check credit system. This system held multiple and critical meanings for Taiwan’s economy; in the sense of upgrading the economy from cash to credit exchange, it can be considered revolutionary.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=89&blog_id=277,39,2007,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

To address this question, this study uses data from TIMSS 2003, which include 47 countries for students at Grade 8 and 26 countries for students at Grade 4. This study starts with a regression analysis of math performance on student family background for each country at each grade level, and the analysis reveals a sharp increase in the effects of family background on the math performance of Taiwanese students from Grade 4 to Grade 8. The results show that the math performance of Taiwanese eighth graders is very heavily influenced by family background from an international perspective. By employing a difference-in-differences methodology which controls for country-level unobserved heterogeneity, this study finds that an increase in the country-level classroom homogeneity from Grade 4 to Grade 8 enhances the effects of family background on student math performance.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=88&blog_id=274,40,2008,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
An Event History Analysis of Elementary School Principal Promotions in Taiwan,"Mei-Hui You, Po-Sheng Ko","gender and career, caregiving, elementary school principals, event history analysis","This study uses an event history analytical approach to explore the career paths of elementary school principals in Taiwan. Existing research divides elementary school teacher career routes into two categories: teaching and administration. Statistics indicate that the number of women who achieve positions as elementary school principals is disproportionate to the number of women employed in elementary schools. Accordingly, this study focuses on two issues: (a) the potential for gender bias in promotions from teacher to administrative positions in Taiwanese elementary schools, and (b) whether domestic factors such as marital status, reproduction, and family caregiving affect teacher career development. Results from an event history analysis indicate significant gender differences in elementary school principals’ career development over time—that is, it takes longer for female elementary school teachers to make the transition to administration, with marital and caregiving factors being the strongest mitigating factors. The authors hope that these empirical findings prove useful in illuminating the current situations in which female leaders find themselves in terms of achieving educational management positions.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=88&blog_id=273,40,2008,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Child Poverty Trends in Taiwan from 1991 to 2005,Cherng-Tay Hsueh,"poverty, poverty ratio, juvenilization of poverty","Due to a general lack of information regarding children’s poverty rates in Taiwan, the goal of this research is to estimate those rates using The Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (SFIE) data collected between 1991 and 2005. The poverty line is defined as one-half the median of disposable income for all Taiwanese families. This analysis indicates that poverty rates among households with children were consistently lower than those among all households and elderly households. Using a poverty ratio with elderly and overall households as reference groups, the data fail to support the “juvenilization of poverty” hypothesis in Taiwan. The analysis also indicates that children living with female single parents were more likely to be living below the poverty line than those living with both parents. Finally, results from binary logit models show that the net effects of female heads of households on the chances of living in poverty were statistically significant over the fifteen-year period, and that those effects were more important than the net effects of single-parent families. All other factors being equal, children living in households headed by females were 60-70 percent more likely to be living below the poverty line than children living in households headed by males. It is hoped that these findings will help Taiwanese policy makers prevent the juvenilization of poverty trends experienced by Western industrialized countries.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=88&blog_id=272,40,2008,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Many researchers perceive Zhu’s works as a special ideal type of waishen (“mainlander”) identity, and variously use it as a reference to identify themselves, to define a specific ethnic group (“waishen-ren”), to analyze the politics of nationalism, and to engage in dialogue focused on Taiwanese/Chinese social identity.

The authors address the issues of whether or not math cramming achieve the desired results, the strength of the average positive effect, and what kinds of students benefit the most and least from math cramming. In addition, we analyze factors influencing student participation in math cramming. Our data are taken from the 2001 and 2003 waves of the Taiwan Education Panel Study. We use propensity score matching to estimate the average treatment effect of math cramming on a sample of Taiwanese ninth grade students. Our findings indicate higher chances of participation in math cramming for students from families with higher socioeconomic status, who enjoy better learning environments, and who have better prior math ability. Overall counterfactual analysis results indicate that for the students in our sample, the average treatment effect of math cramming was positive but small (SD approximately 0.125).

Data are from the 1992-2005 Taiwan Social Change Survey conducted by the Academia Sinica Institute of Sociology. Data on 11,275 intergenerational matched pairs of ethnic intermarriages were used to test six hypotheses. Results from logistic regression models indicate that adult children are more likely to marry across ethnicities when their parents have ethnic intermarriages. Statistically significant differences were found across the three ethnic groups. According to the results, the effect of parental ethnic intermarriage was not modified by increased educational achievement on the part of grooms, but the effect was decreased as the educational achievement of brides increased. For both brides and grooms, the intergenerational influence of ethnic intermarriage was found to decrease over time (i.e., less for older birth cohorts).

The author examines these benefits by distinguishing among actual contact patterns during leisure activities, based on a theoretical framework that separates strong ties from weak ties within personal networks—ties that can produce different benefits. Data were drawn from the 2007 Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS, n=2147), which included a topical module on Leisure Time and Sports created by the International Social Survey Programme. The strong ties index (measured as the extent to which one joins relatives and friends while engaging in leisure activities) explained well why certain participants had more fun and experienced greater overall satisfaction from their leisure activities. In comparison, weak ties (measured as the total number of people contacted during a leisure activity) helped produce more widespread benefits (e.g., physiological, educational, and aesthetic). Such sociability benefits are further differentiated when the sample is split according to individual need for sociability. Among those who prefer spending their free time alone, being accompanied by others with whom they have strong ties during leisure activities still bring stronger benefits. For those who prefer spending their free time with others, having more contacts with weak rather than strong ties contributes to a stronger sense of satisfaction from leisure engagement.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=86&blog_id=263,42,2009,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

The crucial test is employed to examine the competing hypotheses including the effects of the factors regarding family production organization, reproduction organization, and human capital. The evidence indicates that the survival perspective is better for interpreting married women’s labor force participation mechanisms, compared to longstanding neoclassical theory based on capitalist economic logic.

"Technocracy, Democratic Participation and Deliberative Democracy: A Case Study of the Cable Car Citizen Conference",Hung-Jeng Tsai,"technocracy, deliberative democracy, uncertainty of knowledge, citizen consensus conference","In the process of making policy, technocracy can easily result in elitism; appealing to people’s preferences can lack essential deliberation. Deliberative democracy proponents argue that this approach avoids the dogma of technocracy through citizen participation (the main principle of democracy), and at the same time promote the quality of democracy by employing citizen deliberations for pursuing the common good (a primary principle of knowledge). Deliberative democracy is therefore said to be capable of combining democratic participation and professionalism in public decision- making. In this article I first argue that knowledge has inherent uncertainty. Theoretically, various deliberative viewpoints can find different auxiliary conditions to support their own equally rational arguments. Consequently, promoting a certain viewpoint as a consensus requires power to suppress other equally rational arguments. Deliberative democracy is one way to democratize decision-making power, but it is also an activity of domination through the knowledge of presenting arguments. In the case of the Kaohsiung cable car citizen consensus conference, we can learn how deliberative actions interact with evolving historical contingencies. Any final consensus is therefore a consequence of a knowledge-power complex that includes both rational deliberation and various “irrational” factors.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=85&blog_id=251,43,2009,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"‘I Shop, Therefore I Am’: Female Time Concepts of Shopping and Self",Yu Ying Lee,"shopping, female shopper, time conception, self-identity","The main concern in this paper is transforming women’s seemly trivial shopping experiences into an academic discussion. Shopping is not a self- indulgent activity, but a social practice that everyone must participate in. Focusing on how female shoppers shop in relation to spending time, I argue that women try to build self-identity through shopping practices. I elaborate four types of female shoppers as follows: efficient and solitary, the follower, the flanerie, and the careful and meticulous calculater. There are three motifs in western literature regarding women and shopping: shopping as empowerment, as flanerie, and as self-discipline. Here I show that these motifs can be applied to Taiwanese female shoppers. When a woman shops alone, she is indulgent in visual and sensual pleasure, while at the same time she is busy in comparing prices and looking for trendy merchandise. As she exercises her free choice to buy, she is also constrained by market forces that limit those choices. Women love shopping because they want to find uniqueness. It can be argued that women build self-identity and confidence through a dialect of resistance and negotiation with social constraints.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=85&blog_id=256,43,2009,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Furthermore, we suggest that the development of this industry occurred in two stages. Pre-1990, the state took the lead in promoting bio-pharmaceutical research and production, but the effort failed due to a lack of engagement with private capital and lack of frontier knowledge on the development of the industry. Starting in the mid-1990s, the state became an enabler, and many smaller firms took advantage of the outsourcing practices of large international firms in order to engage in global commodity chains. However, even though the innovation pattern of Taiwan’s bio-pharmaceutical industry fits well with Taiwan’s institutional features, we believe that global links have benefited merely a handful of smaller firms rather than the industry as a whole.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=85&blog_id=254,43,2009,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Does Language Matter? Ethnicity, Linguistic Capital and Occupational Attainment in Taiwan","Wan-Chi Chen, Yu-wen Wen","linguistic capital, occupational attainment, ethnic group, entrepreneur","Mandarin has been the official language of Taiwan since 1945. Mandarin fluency is regarded as linguistic capital leading to other forms of capital, and as a stepping-stone to gaining desirable goods and positions. Accordingly, the literature contains no studies of the role of Taiwanese dialect (Minnangu) in occupational attainment, even though it is the primary dialect for the majority Minnan ethnic population. Existing studies suffer from simultaneous causality, resulting in biased estimates of language effects. Here we use data from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS) to show that most differences between Minnan and non-Minnan Taiwanese are attributable to language rather than ethnicity. In addition to confirming the importance of designation as an “official” language, our results underscore the role of a prevalent dialect in social mobility. Our specific conclusions are (a) Mandarin fluency is beneficial for obtaining higher-status jobs, and accounts for the occupational status advantage held by Mainlanders, (b) Minnan Taiwanese are more likely to own and operate small firms, with Taiwanese fluency explaining much of this difference with Mainlanders, (c) dual Mandarin/Taiwanese fluency helps entrepreneurs develop medium and large firms, and (d) an instrumental variable analysis provides a better estimate of true language effect on occupational attainment.

This paper uses the historical case of black market schools in postwar Hong Kong to dissect educationpolitics in settings marked by relatively mild intensity of state formation. After the war Hong Kong remained a British colony, the ruling regime’s legitimacy was not dependent on strong support from local residents, and the militancy of the pro-Beijing and Pro-Taipei forces was moderate. These factors suppressed intensity of state formation, reduced the government’s willingness to provide education, and resulted in the proliferation of private schools. To prevent private institutions from endangering pupils’ safety and the Colony’s stability, the government moved to intensively regulate them. This “insufficiently provided, negatively regulated” approach resulted in unfulfilled educational demand and the problem of unregistered schools. Although the government felt compelled to suppress unlawful institutions, it recognized that strong actions against such schools would increase the number of unschooled children and provoke public resentment. Inspired by this historical case, the author of this paper constructs a typology of state educational policies by cross-tabulating the dimensions of “educational provision” and “mode of private school regulation.” He also proposes theoretical hypotheses on the connection between these policies and state formation.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=84&blog_id=465,44,2010,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Transnational Maternal Citizenship: Changing Moral Economy on State Margins,Antonia Chao,"northern Fujian province (Minbei), border zone, labor of sex and romance, moral economy, transnational motherhood","The author uses long-term ethnographic research data to examine changing transmigration patterns along the northern border of Fujian province, modes of constructing gender and sexual subjectivities implicit in migratory patterns, and how these patterns and modes respond to recent crossstrait politico-economic configurations and border control mechanisms. A second goal is to contribute to our understanding of potential links, junctures, and ruptures within relationships among a given society’s economic activities, expressions of affects, and moral order. I offer four theses: (a) due to transforming politico-economic configurations and border-control mechanisms across the Taiwan Strait during the past decade, married women in northern Fujian province (Minbei) have replaced single men as the largest group of migrants to Taiwan, (b) the majority of these women enter Taiwan via fraudulent marriages, and an increasing number are thereafter engaged in what I refer to as the “labor of sex and romance”, (c) the first two factors are deeply affecting moral economy practice and understanding, especially in terms of gender-based labor divisions and ideology, and (d) unlike previous researchers of migration and transnational motherhood, I found that Minbei border-crossing informants treat the identity and profession of motherhood in an emotionally distant manner.

Changes of Time Structure and the Ideals of Time Politics: An Analysis from the Perspectives of the Sociology of Time,Tsuo-Yu CHENG,"social time, sociology of time, time structure, time politics, unpaid leave","This article analyzes contemporary changes of time structure and the ideals of time politics from the perspectives of the sociology of time. After defining the main terms, a tendency toward change is noted in contemporary time structure from standard to flexible. One result is a differentiation between work and non-work time that has been replaced to a certain degree by a “three-period society” (Dreizeitgesellschaft), in which “time affluence”(Zeitwohlstand) is considered the most important goal of time politics. Also addressed are the concepts of duty-work and unpaid leave in Taiwan, two examples of ways in which elements of time politics may be neglected. These topics appear to be growing in importance in Taiwanese sociology, and therefore require us to address them directly.

The Disappearance of Clinical Factors: Knowledge Production Politics of Cesarean-Section Research in Taiwan,Chia-Ling WU,"knowledge production, STS, clinical factors, cesarean section","In this paper I investigate the transformation of knowledge production in researching high cesarean section (CS) rates in Taiwan over the past fifty years. I use the perspectives of science, technology and society studies (STS), and medical sociology to analyze how the social structure of scientific communities and changes in data collection, research tools, research conceptualization, and research modeling have led to this transformation. The primary data include 102 research articles, book chapters, master theses, and reports on high CS rates in Taiwan, plus interviews with 21 researchers and obstetricians. Starting in the 1960s, obstetricians used hospital medical records to document increasing CS rates in specific hospitals, and published their findings in local academic journals. They focused on clinical factors such as breech presentation and previous C-sections, and suggested improvements in obstetric techniques to avoid unnecessary C-sections. In the 1990s, Taiwan’s high CS rate became a widely reported and discussed issue, and obstetricians faced pressure from their peers. In addition, laboratory research started to receive greater academic prestige than studying epidemiological data, therefore CS research by obstetricians came to an almost complete halt. Such studies were replaced by research from the fields of public health, medical administration, and health economics. These efforts relied mainly on National Health Insurance database to study CS trends in Taiwan. Their studies, which treated clinical factors as controlling variables, focused on institutional factors and birth women’s behaviors to construct explanatory models. Here I argue in support of the potential contribution of studies by obstetricians to childbirth reform, and suggest strategies to bring clinical factors back into research efforts on high CS rates in Taiwan.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=83&blog_id=250,45,2010,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Logistic Action by Service Users: Shaping Care Trajectory in Early Treatment Systems,Fan-Tzu Tseng,"developmental delay, early treatment, care trajectory, logistic action, user-professional relationship","Past research on parenting disabled children has mostly used a psycho- pathological approach to explore stress and adjustment. In this study I will propose a “logistic action” concept to analyze parental actions in the context of Taiwan’s Early Treatment System (ETS). Data from interviews with twenty-four parents/caretakers of children with developmental delay indicate that they are capable of actively shaping their children’s care trajectories. Biographical records written by parents and published on the Internet also support this finding. To enact the multi-dimensional and disunited ETS, parents must develop multiple sophisticated logistic actions in order to deal with the highly problematic trajectory of developmental delay. Taking on the role of logistician requires intensive information, articulation, and body work in order to organize and implement an individualized and flexible child- raising scheme. This concept of logistic action can enrich our understanding of user-professional relationships.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=83&blog_id=249,45,2010,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Patterns and Effects of Social Relations: A Comparison of Taiwan, the United States and China","Nan Lin, Chih-Jou Jay Chen, Yang-Chih Fu","social capital, social networks, guanxi, cross-national comparison","In this paper we examine how social relations show differential patterns and exert differential effects on accessing social capital in three societies: Taiwan, the United States, and China. Employing data from the position generator, a measure of social capital, we discerned different patterns of social relations in the three societies, such as kin ties, work ties, friends, and other ties. Three possible explanations are posed for assessing possible patterns of social relations and their effects on social capital across the three societies: economic structures (industrialization and marketization), socio- cultural institutions, and political-economic regimes. Our results indicate different patterns of social relations in the three societies. In the U.S., work ties, friends, kin ties, and other ties are distinctive types of social relations. Friends and other ties, rather than work ties or kin ties, exert stronger effects on accessing better social capital. In China, kin ties, friends, and other ties are interrelated, and share effects on accessing social capital. In Taiwan, kin ties, friends, and other ties still overlap but to a lesser extent than they exhibit in China, and the relative effect of kin ties on social capital, while still persisting, has eased up relative to the effects of work ties, friends, and other ties. We suggest that these patterns are more consistent with an economic-structure explanation than a socio-cultural or political-economic regime explanation. In addition to suggesting a slow but persistent process of cultural change, the data also shed light on the nature of guanxi in Chinese societies, and on the prevalence of the social principle of homophily transcending developmental or economic processes.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=83&blog_id=248,45,2010,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
The Making of a Chinese Semi-Planned Administration: Soft Budget Constraints and Local Transition from Entrepreneur to Rentier,Yia-Ling Liu,"semi-planned administration, soft budget constraints, rentier, target responsibility system, state paternalism","The author constructs the concept of a Chinese semi-planned administration to explore the grassroots transition from entrepreneur to rentier in Wenzhou, Wuxi, and Jianshi, and to analyze the pathology of local soft budget constraints throughout rural China. The argument is made that the combination of the target responsibility system, cost-shifting strategy, and state paternalism crippled the capacity of the state’s hierarchical supervision system, and corrupted local fiscal discipline. The Chinese semi-planned administration has shaped the rational thinking and patterned behaviors of township cadres, resulting in (a) squeezed spaces for township government leaders to negotiate with their superiors, (b) lower transaction costs for townships to carry debt, and (c) higher discount rates for township cadres. All of these factors have forced township cadres to pursue short-term goals in order to earn promotions, rather than long-term development goals that can benefit their localities. In addition to supporting the transitioning of township governments from entrepreneurs to rentiers, these actions also soften local budget constraints.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=83&blog_id=247,45,2010,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

In most cases, Vietnamese women who are the wives or mistresses of Taiwanese men also become dummy owners of Taiwanese capital. Patriarchal imagination is the reason why Taiwanese businessmen choose Vietnamese women as dummy owners of their businesses: in exchange for money, they expect subordination to ensure their business property rights. However, Vietnamese citizenship gives women political power to leverage the patriarchal power of Taiwanese men—an unintended consequence of their patriarchal imaginations.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=83&blog_id=246,45,2010,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

The core of the Tibetan exile economy consists of its informal sector, the sweater-selling business which requires that Tibetan exiles travel with their family members to different Indian cities and towns to sell woolens. The competition between exiles selling similar products may have engendered fatal effects on ethnic solidarity, but sweater sellers have managed to avert this outcome. This study demonstrates how exiled Tibetans in India have developed various measures to deal with the problems of individual self- interests by averaging profits within each market. Thus, Tibetan sweater- sellers have learned to survive while creating a model for a moral economy.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=82&blog_id=244,46,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Contingency is presented as an essential factor in this religious construction. A mutual-reinforcing operation between transcendental and secular discourses is found as a characteristic of the discursive production of popular religion. This basic operation shows how temples in Tainan have undergone a transformation from public entities to temple associations since the 1970s. This transformation has at least two implications: (a) the guiding principle of temple publicity has changed from territorial to power-holding, and (b) the emergence of structural differentiation in the field of popular religion. In connection with this, the author reflects on the potential for and difficulty of integrating local temples within the politico-cultural localization.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=82&blog_id=243,46,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Determinants of Kinship Networks in Taiwanese Business Groups,Zong-Rong LEE,"Business group, kinship network, kinecon group","Scholars in East Asian studies have long recognized Chinese familism as an important cultural practice underlying economic life in Taiwan. Under familism, kinship dynamics represent a pivotal governing force in the organization of business ownership, control networks, and expansion strategies. Two questions emerge: Do visible global kinship networks exist within markets long perceived as family capitalism archetypes? If so, what factors affect kinship formation among business groups? While business group researchers in Taiwan have long examined the intra-group dimensions of kinship ties, few systematic studies have focused on inter- group dimensions. In this study, hypotheses derived from three major theoretical traditions—familism, political economy, and post-industrialism— are formulated and tested using a large body of data on business groups and kinship networks among business owners. The data support the familism and political economy perspectives and refute the post-industrial hypothesis.

The Logic of Collective Violence in Street Protests,"Yin-Zu CHEN, Yow-Suen SEN, Ya-Cin CHEN","Protest, protest targets, policing, violence","While the transition to a more liberal and democratic political structure in Taiwan has the potential to reduce occurrences of violence during collective protests, it does not account for the occurrences of violence during individual demonstrations. Assuming that the political opportunity structure in a democratic society is relatively stable, this paper argues that the logic of violence in collective protests is found in the characteristics, actions, and interactions of the three major parties (protestors, police, and protest targets) that constitute the context of any given demonstration. Using data from Taiwan Television’s News Audiovisual Database for 501 protest events between 1996 and 2006, the results of multivariate analysis indicate that the most potent mix for violence is a medium-sized group of protestors (100 to 1,000), a rally with minimum organizational structure, enterprises as target, and strong police intention and intervention for crowd dispersal.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=82&blog_id=241,46,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Our primary argument is that the mismatch between Taiwanese state structure and coordination problems faced by shipbuilding industry was responsible for the failure to establish a large shipbuilding industry in the last quarter of the twentieth century. A conservative financial regime and lack of stable connections between the shipbuilding and marine industries were incompatible with coordination requirements for the parties involved. As a result, the only large shipbuilding firm in Taiwan, the China Shipbuilding Corporation, failed to overcome turbulent business cycles to achieve profitability.

The Weight of Information: Taiwan Stock Market Social Structure,Chung-Shen WU,"information, stock market, sociology of financial markets, social space, market structure","Share trading is a common investment activity in Taiwan, yet little is known about stock market social space or structure. In this paper I show how such a social space is made possible by information through which investors analyze market-related buying, selling, and communication, with signals rapidly flowing in a space that is disembodied from all other aspects of daily life. The actors that occupy various social positions inject substantial resources into this space. Data from in-depth and screen-based interviews with investors, fund managers, traders, and journalists are used to clarify the processes through which investors recognize signals. Results indicate that market structure has three important characteristics: (a) information recognition is an ontological situation in which actors receive signals, mobilize a knowledge system, and open a signal space, (b) actor interpretations of signals are based on market and industrial knowledge, with market scope contingent on the ability to use that knowledge, and (c) the ring- like and hierarchical structure is constructed by information access skills and social networks. The flow space closes when investors return to their non- market worlds. This research represents a new ontological research frame, and adds to Knorr Cetina’s (2002) investor knowledge base theory.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=81&blog_id=237,47,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

In addition, the popularity of Taiwanese Xiao-Qu pop during the Japanese colonial period is an example of the subjective and mixed-blood elements of Taiwanese ballads that evolved into the three cities streets, Monga, Dwaduedia, and Ximending categories.

The results indicate that formula for estimating accuracy of single imputation can be derived from the observed frequency of the response patterns that correspond to Guttman-scale types. In addition, refusal rates did not have much impact on the accuracy of simple imputation due to the fixed refusal patterns simulated from the gold standard.

"Exploitation or Reciprocity?

Based on data from interviews with Chinese migrant/sex workers and Taiwanese sex traffickers, I will argue that the prevailing discourse misconstrues cross- strait commercial sex networks and the material bases of the underground economy. I will also argue that the cross-strait underclass represents the main labor source in this economy, and that the regime that criminalizes commercial sex and rigid border controls actually makes Chinese migrant sex workers a vulnerable group for exploitation. The intersection of gender, class, sexuality, and migration thus makes the fragile positions of Chinese migrant sex workers even worse than those of local sex workers. However, my data indicate that Chinese migrant sex workers are not necessarily sexual victims, nor do they generate the feeling of being exploited. Instead, relations between them and human snakes are usually contradictory and ambiguous, marked by a mix of co-operation and antagonism. The balance of power between migrant/sex workers and human snakes is uneven, yet migrant sex workers may view it as reciprocal, since their pimps and traffickers are the only actors capable of negotiating with the state.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=80&blog_id=234,48,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Changes in Gender-role Attitudes in Taiwan, 1991-2001",Yu-Hsia LU,"Gender role attitudes, cohort change, cohort analysis, social change, women’s employment","The author examines changes in Taiwanese attitudes toward gender roles between 1991 and 2001, a period of social transformation. According to pooled cross-sectional data from the 1991 and 2001 Taiwan Social Surveys, there was a significant increase in egalitarian attitudes toward women’s work and familial roles among both women and men. Women made a more pronounced shift in attitudes toward gender-role segregation within families, while men made a more pronounced shift regarding women’s employment. Results from a cohort analysis of changes indicate that both cohort succession and intra-cohort changes have contributed to increasing egalitarianism among both women and men. Change in male attitudes has been affected more within cohorts than via cohort succession, while change in female attitudes has been affected more via cohort succession. According to results from intercorrelation analyses, these changes in attitudes are consistent with symbolic-interaction perspectives. Unlike men’s attitudes, women’s attitudes are more likely the result of group norms, and thus more ideologically based, men’s attitudes are shaped more by their positions or life situations and thus less ideologically based. The data also indicate that the trend of increasing egalitarianism is widespread, occurring approximately equally in all socio- demographic subgroups. The one exception is women with higher levels of education, whose changes were found to be smaller compared to less educated women, likely due to a ceiling effect.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=80&blog_id=233,48,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Accounting for Sex Segregation in Taiwan Higher Education: Differences between Vocational and Academic Sectors,"Wan-Chi CHEN, Ya-Lin SYU","Higher education, gender segregation, empowerment, vocational education","Previous research suggests that degree of gender segregation in fields of study in Taiwan is mainly influenced by women’s representation in higher education and changes in the scale of fields of study. However, structural factors have never been taken into consideration, even as structural diversification in higher education increases. Using data on tertiary degrees earned by Taiwanese men and women in all academic fields from 1982 to 2009, we re-examined determinants of gender segregation. Results from regression models indicate that while women’s representation in higher education and changes in the scale of fields of study are important factors, the ways they influence gender segregation are not the same across educational sectors. In academic-oriented universities and graduate programs, increases in women’s representation reduce gender segregation, with change in scale of fields not exerting great influence. In contrast, in vocational and junior colleges, expansion in traditionally male or female fields of study increases gender segregation—that is, women’s representation exerts very little effect, if any. A likely explanation is the much stronger connection between vocational-oriented education and the labor market, which makes gender segregation in the vocational sector much more resistant to change.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=80&blog_id=231,48,2011,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Manifestation of ling Efficacy: From Symbolic System to Social Coalition,Jen-Chieh TING,"efficacy, folk religion, coalition, reciprocity, structuralization","Although ling is a key concept for understanding Chinese folk religion, it suffers from a lack of theoretical analysis. That explains the motivation for this paper, which begins with a discussion of how social and supernatural worlds are defined and reproduced in Han patrilineal society. A structuralization principle considered inherent to the system may presuppose a manifestation of spiritual efficacy, resulting in analytical distinctions between two kinds of efficacy: mere and interactive. A secondary type may consider reciprocity between spiritual efficacy and receiver feedback. The secondary efficacy framework hints at the long-term link between spirit and collectivity, meaning that many collective processes may be connected to this kind of efficacy social construction. We also discuss the concept of “doing efficacy” as a means of understanding supply and feedback within the secondary efficacy process.

In contrast to Bourdieu’s emphasis on habitus formation using the concepts of individual practices and fields, we use the concept of interstice to draw the focus on the community boundary where the subject using symbolic repertoire establishes a bricolage to transform the wider structure into a local symbolic construct. We borrow from De Certeau’s “practice of everyday life” and Paul Willis’s “symbolic creativity” to interpret how a subject operates in a manner that differs from the simply coined “cultural resistance”. We suggest that a subject’s “art of making” results from interactions among a cultural framework, larger system, and historical occasion, and that this trajectory move along in forming the community identity—that is, an unpredictable “grounded aesthetic” that bends according to historical flow.

Taiwanese Students Pursuing Higher Education in China: Institutional Frameworks and Migration Trajectories,"Yi-Fan WU, Pei-Chia LAN","student migration, reterritorialization, cross-strait relations","A growing number of Taiwanese students have emigrated to China for higher education purposes during the last two decades. The authors use this specific case to engage the student migration literature. Based on indepth interviews and policy analysis, we examine the migration trajectories of Taiwanese students according to an analytical framework consisting of macro (policy), meso (organizational), and micro (individual) levels. We have identified three types of Taiwanese students—degree-oriented, work-oriented, and family-guided—with further differences in terms of migration motivation, school access, and labor market consequences. This case is special in that the Chinese government is giving these students a quasi-internal migration status that conflicts with the fact that these students crossed national borders. The host government adopts a policy of “reterritorialization” to symbolically address the “homeland” status of Taiwanese students, while the students themselves enact a strategy of “deterritorialization” for the purposes of spatial mobility and capital accumulation. Such encounters hold potential benefits and contradictions, and Taiwanese students find themselves in an ambivalent postion of “in-betweeness” regarding both educational and labor market status.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=78&blog_id=221,50,2012,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
The Politics of Reconstruction: A Comparative Study of Earthquake Relief Efforts in China and Taiwan,Thung-Hong LIN,"disaster, earthquake, social inequality, democracy, authoritarianism","The author argues that regime type determines resource distribution tied to post-disaster reconstruction. In a democratic regime, when societal resource mobilization capacity is strong and administrative principal-agent problems are few, it is possible to adequately manage the deterioration of social inequality after a disaster. In contrast, in an authoritarian regime marked by limited freedoms of speech and association, politicians and administrators tend toward corruption, social inequalities worsen, and social protests suffer. I use two earthquakes (1999 in Taiwan and 2008 in Sichuan province) to investigate hypotheses regarding reconstruction politics. According to my findings, the Chinese communist regime suppressed civil association and mass media freedoms, resulting in greater inequalities in land/housing redistribution and increased collective action on the part of Chinese citizens.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=78&blog_id=220,50,2012,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Political Economy of the Chinese Stratified Welfare Regime,Hung-Jeng TSAI,"welfare regime, combined social pooling and personal accounts, new cooperative medical scheme, urban-rural coordinated development","The author argues that Chinese welfare institutional stratification has roots in developmental strategies adopted during different periods, resulting in the need for an overall political-economic analysis of the Chinese welfare system for full understanding. To maintain the advantages of Esping- Andersen’s analytical framework when applied to Chinese development, I conduct a theoretical revision of his “three worlds of welfare capitalism,” and propose a historical analysis of institutional dynamics as a crucial tool for regime classification. According to my theoretical revision, I argue that the postwar Chinese welfare regime reflects the ongoing course of state-led conservatism, with welfare institutions divided into three mutually exclusive blocks during the height of the country’s planned economy period. After the Cultural Revolution, these blocks were fragmented as individual work units and eventually lost their social protection function. Increasing wage inequality between regions and rural-urban areas has resulted in a social insurance hierarchy in which benefits are pegged to contributions. Fiscal decentralization due to economic reforms, which confines new social insurance plans to prefecture or county levels, continues to limit the effects of risk pooling. In this article I explore the development of the country’s New Cooperative Medical Scheme to see the possible change of Chinese conservative regime. While it addresses basic medical problems in rural areas, it also restricts rural workers to specific living areas in which they receive poor quality medical treatment. To successfully deal with this problem, any coordinated urban-rural development scheme requires one of two conditions: greater income for rural workers, or a major investment by the national government. Neither condition has been observed so far, therefore it appears that the Chinese welfare regime will continue according to state-led and stratified conservatism.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=78&blog_id=219,50,2012,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Labor, Capital and State: Labor Conflicts in China from a Marxist Perspective",Chris King-Chi CHAN,"labor, class, conflict, china","The author uses a Marxist perspective to analyze changing patterns in migrant worker protests. While a new working class in China has emerged and recreated itself since 1978, today’s labor researchers have mostly rejected the Marxist practice of using the social relations of production as a point of departure for analysis. Instead, Chinese migrant workers’ protests under a capitalist production regime are understood as part of a citizens’ movement. In this paper the author argues that this new approach fails to adequately account for recent changes in migrant worker struggles. He advocates a return to the Marxist tradition to study worker struggle in a specific social, cultural and political context, especially in terms of analyzing the growing number of labor-capital conflicts in both foreign-owned and domestic private enterprises in China.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=78&blog_id=218,50,2012,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Income Inequality Among Families with Children in Taiwan, 1980 to 2006","Yeu-Sheng Hsieh, Meng-sian Jhou, Yu-lin Chi, Ming-yi Chang","Income Inequality, Income Effect, Compositional Effect, Variance Function Regression","To explain trends in income inequality among families with children in Taiwan from 1980 to 2006, we decompose changes in income inequality to the contribution of residence urbanization, family structure, education, and age of the primary wage earner in terms of compositional effect of family changes and income effect of labor market changes. Using annual data from the Survey of Family Income and Expenditures, we applied variance function regressions to analyze mean and variance across family income inequality. Our results indicate an increase in variance of one-third from 1980 to 2006. Between-group differences among various family subgroups was found to be the major source of worsening income inequality before 2000, and both within-and between-group differences among various family subgroups were equally responsible after 2000. We found that the compositional effects of increasing labor force participation for women, educational expansion, and urbanization are suppressors of family income inequality. Identified boosters of family income inequality included the compositional effects of increasing divorce rates and both economically disadvantaged single-parent and less educated parent families, as well as income disparities in single-parent, highly educated parent, and middle-aged and elderly parent families.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=77&blog_id=470,51,2012,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Constructing Talking Styles in Public Deliberation: Influences of Social Relations and Social Skills,Yu-sheng LIN,"Social Relations, Social Skills, Talking Style, Consensus Conference","Deliberative democracy theorists argue that discussions involving deliberative talk not only increase decision-making quality, but also nurture participant sense of citizenship. Although these theorists have identified the benefits of deliberative talk, their explanations for why deliberations in real world tend to shift between deliberative and adversarial styles are insufficient. Existing explanations focus on the importance of creating public spheres and how such spheres encourage deliberative talk. While these explanations remind us of the importance of objective conditions for establishing ideal deliberation, they overemphasize the importance of objective conditions for objective discussions and neglect the social construction aspects of deliberation. Due to this tendency, existing research cannot explain the variation of talking styles in practical deliberations. To address this theoretical gap, I argue that public spheres are interstitial and multilayered social networks. To make such discussions possible, participants must highlight one relation and suppress other alternative relations to guide the discussion process. Using the 2004 Surrogate Motherhood Consensus Conference as a case study, I argue that the creation of, maintenance of, and shifts in talking styles in public deliberations are social constructions. When participants identify a discussion as one between friends, principles such as equality, mutual respect, reasoning, and seeking the common good are highlighted. In these scenarios, participants use a deliberative style, but when they identify a discussion as one between adversaries, self-interest protection becomes the dominant goal, and an adversarial style emerges. Underpinning relations may change due to participant interaction, resulting in a shift in talking style. I also apply the concept of social skill to articulate how participants enact and suppress social relations, thereby reshaping a discussion. I identify five social skills that are important for defining and redefining deliberation: motivation, conversational skills, cultural resonance, agenda-setting capacity, and the capacity to seize timing.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=77&blog_id=469,51,2012,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

According to Weber, Luther transformed the meaning of the term Beruf, and the modification changed theological thinking in what he called the “Protestant-German area”, he further claims that even the “Catholic-Latin area” and other protestant sects were influenced by the change. In this article I discuss the specificity of this analysis and the logic behind Weber’s investigation of the development of the protestant ethic, defining this particular reasoning as a kind of “ideal typical” methodology, and observing that Luther and his translation occupied a central position in Weber’s book.

"Ethnic Differences in Higher Education Attainment: Generation, Tuition Subsidies and Public Sector Employment",Nai-Teh WU,"Social Economic Status (SES), Tuition Subsidy, Public Sector Employment, Ethnic Politics, Educational Attainment, Class Mobility","Differences in educational attainment between Chinese mainlanders and native Taiwanese contributed significantly to the differences between the two groups in terms of socioeconomic status in Taiwan. For many years it was assumed by many local scholars that differences in educational attainment were largely due to tuition subsidies for the children of government employees—a sector dominated by Chinese mainlanders. This assumption was challenged by two researchers using new data on tuition subsidies gathered through a national survey. Their research however has overlooked the social change effects of economic development, and their statistical models failed to tackle the core question of whether higher educational attainment among Chinese mainlanders can be ascribed to tuition subsidies. This paper uses the same above-mentioned data to confirm the conventional wisdom: subsidies to the children of government employees contributed significantly to higher educational attainment among Chinese mainlanders prior to the period of intensive economic development in Taiwan. This advantage was significantly reduced, but not eliminated, in the later stage when college tuition was relatively affordable to the families with lower incomes. The positive correlation with parental employment in the public sector has also steadily decreased.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=76&blog_id=217,52,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Ecology of Time: An Outline of A New Concept of Time-Sociology,Tsuo-Yu CHENG,"Ecology of Time, Temporal Demand, Temporal Power, Sociology of Time, Time","Time is admittedly one of the most important topics worth discussing in sociology. However, the gulf between the social theories of time and the empirical researches in time is a significant problem which has hindered the progress of the sociology of time for long. The theories of time are often too esoteric to contribute to empirical research or to be inspected by empirical research. The sociological empirical researches on time are therefore short of theoretical foundations all the while, so that their achievements can only give descriptions instead of critical analyses. In view of this deficiency in time-sociology, the purpose of this paper is to outline an “ecology of time” to joint the theoretical dimension of the social studies of time and the dimension of the empirical time research of sociology. The idea of the ecology of time emphasizes that time can be construed as a referential mechanism that enables social interactions to occur at a required time point by coordinating the social actions of different agents. For this reason, time is concerned with the fairness of the coordination between the social actions of different agents. The task of the ecology of time is to investigate the facts of the temporal coordination between social actions of different agents empirically and critically. Finally, this paper will also attempt to build a time-ecological model as a possible frame of the subsequent empirical time research of sociology.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=76&blog_id=216,52,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
"Licitness, Legitimatizing Illicitness and Illicitness: Pawn Transactions in Taiwan, 1945-2010",Shih-Feng HUNG,"Pawnshops, Pawn Transactions, Informal Finance, Financial Dualism","The author uses post-World War II pawn transactions in Taiwan, plus results from an historical investigation of their policy environments, to illustrate informal transaction mechanisms and transformations derived from interactions between them and Taiwan’s legal system. For many decades officials adhered to a policy aimed at preventing the sale of stolen goods in tightly controlled pawn transactions, but today they have characteristics of a formal economy as well as an informal finance system. I present evidence indicating the existence of three transaction types: those based on objects (licitness), those based on laws (Legitimatizing illicitness), and those based on violence (illicitness). The first can be analyzed as a system of lending within a formal economic domain, with transactions conducted according to the exchange values of objects, and strictly monitored by the government. The second and third are within the informal transactions domain. Transactions based on laws occupy a legal grey area in which companies link informal transactions to legal systems, thus positioning the transactions somewhere between past private sector customs and Taiwan’s current legal code in order to legitimatize informal transactions. The logic behind transactions based on violence is a penalized system that is gradually systematized, thereby marginalizing laws in the process. In this paper I discuss pawn transaction types in terms of financial dualism, informal economy as well as informal finance, in an effort to determine the current roles being played by the State and their limitations.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=76&blog_id=215,52,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Limitations of the Impacts of Globalization: Taiwanese Attitudes Toward Growing Numbers of Economic and Marital Migrants,"Han-Pi CHANG, Chin-Fen CHANG","Marital Migration, Migrant Workers, Globalization, Social Contacts, Ethnic Prejudice","Increasing migration across borders is one result of ongoing globalization trends and affordable transportation costs. At the same time that many Taiwanese continue to go abroad for business, education, and travel, residents from other Asian countries are viewing Taiwan as an immigration destination. We used data from the 2008 Taiwan Social Change Survey to analyze attitudes toward increases in the numbers of economic and marital migrants into Taiwan, and found that Taiwanese opposition to migrants is dependent on their nationality and reason for migration. Results from seemingly unrelated regression analyses identified demographic characteristics, achieved social and economic status, and ethnic prejudice as important determinants of acceptance or rejection. We also found that the impacts of globalization (e.g., international travel, getting to know foreigners, foreign spouses) exerted non-significant or negative effects on attitudes regarding immigration. Our conclusion is that the impacts of globalization are limited, and must be examined according to local social and political contexts.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=76&blog_id=214,52,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

To overcome these limitations, in this study I use job history data from the Social Stratification and Mobility in East Asia study to examine gender differences in within-firm upward mobility in Taiwan. Results indicate a fatherhood premium among males, with married male having higher probabilities of job promotions compared to single males. This probability reaches its peak when a married worker becomes a father for the first time. In contrast, female workers tend to face motherhood penalties. After entering marriage, the potential for female workers to quit their jobs increases significantly, and the probability of leaving the labor market is highest when she becomes pregnant for the first time.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=75&blog_id=212,53,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

It is commonly assumed that recent examples of integrated community building in Taiwan are helping to establish a Habermasian public sphere. Instead, I view it as a normative and teleological discourse that presumes an increase in citizen consciousness via citizen participation. In this paper I argue that researchers need a new conceptual framework to describe actual practices in public spaces. Michael Herzfeld’s “cultural intimacy” concept is worthy of further development, since it addresses how people articulate different scales of sociality by means of inward acknowledgement of cultural habits. The community I use as the focus for this study is a place where people mostly know each other, and therefore can only develop new forms of publicity based on their experiences and understanding of their daily lives. My conclusion is that publicity reflects how people can cultivate ways to mediate communication among individuals, as well as between individuals and the collective whole. In short, cultural intimacy is a precise conceptual framework for mediating publicity.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=75&blog_id=211,53,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

They have received strong criticism regarding the commodification and exploitation of female bodies, but many view them simply as commercialized ACG fan activities with no connection to gender inequality. In this paper we attempt to develop a new sociological analysis of gender and labor embedded in a fan subculture framework, based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted over a period of three years and a thick description of maid-waitress disciplinary processes and labor practices, as well as identity negotiation and daily interactions with “master- customers.” We propose a new concept of performing labor to establish a dialogue with and to supplement the well-known emotional labor concept. We argue that performing labor (a) is not only an emotional labor subtype, but also a unique form of labor generated by a combination of an emerging entertainment/service industry and postmodern urban consumerism, and (b) is based on fan culture, thereby enhancing the potential for empowering maid-waitresses to escape from the existing gender structure and to create daily tactics, group consensus, and alternative agency.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=75&blog_id=210,53,2013,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Crossley’s (2004) article, “Fat Is a Sociological Issue,” is analyzed in terms of the concept of energy ratios and ‘obesity as a social fact.’ It is argued that critical realism locates obese bodies and energy ratios as biological facts existing outside of socio-cultural contexts. In contrast, social constructionists approach obesity as a medical issue, an approach that is criticized as an example of a discourse replacing the actor. However, the realists’ approach is also criticized as ignoring the construction of scientific knowledge. Based on the ANT ontology, I argue that the concept of energy ratio should be reexamined in terms of knowledge production and heterogeneous networks.

Social Capital and Trust: Reflections on Data from the East Asia Social Capital Survey,Ray-May HSUNG,"Organizational Social Capital, Individual Social Capital, Trust, Social Capital Survey in East Asia","Western political scientists and sociologists have shown strong interest in causal relations among participation in voluntary associations, trust norms, and political efficacy in democratization. However, few have explored appropriate explanatory paths among these concepts in East Asian democratization processes and civil society. In this paper I use data from the 2012 Social Capital Survey in East Asia on accessed networks, participation in voluntary associations, political efficacy, and social trust. A surprising and unique phenomenon in relations among civic participation, political efficacy and social trust was observed for Taiwan compared to the other three countries (Japan, Korea and China). Participation in voluntary associations was very low, but the volume and variety of social resources embedded in accessed networks were exceptionally high. Apparently, the majority of the voting public feels incapable of influencing government performance, therefore they have very low interest in politics and very high distrust of government agencies. However, they do show concern about neighborhood issues and claim that they are willing to contribute to their society. Results from comparative and descriptive analyses of the survey indicate that Taiwan and Japan are at two opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of hierarchical structures of civic organizations. In Taiwan, organizational social capital tied to participating in voluntary associations apparently does not affect personal, institutional, or general trust, yet individual social capital embedded in accessed social networks affects both personal and general trust. In contrast, the largest percentage of participants in voluntary associations among the four countries in the survey was in Japan (>80%), creating organizational social capital serving as the basis of institutional and general trust.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=74&blog_id=206,54,2014,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

In this paper, five conclusions are offered based on a review of data from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey: (a) adolescents report higher anxiety and distress levels when their parents suffer from low marital quality, (b) for low-quality marriages, parental divorce significantly reduces adolescent levels of distress, especially compared to youth whose parents stay in their marriages, (c) the effects of parental divorce on adolescent mental health is conditional on their parents’ past marital quality, (d) in low-quality marriages, divorce does not decrease conflict levels between parents, but the negative effects of parental conflict on adolescent distress levels disappears once they decide to end their marriages, and (e) reduced father-child conflict partly explains why parental divorce benefits the well-being of children. In summary, ending low-quality marriages is beneficial to the mental health of adolescent children by removing the negative effects of parental conflict and decreasing father-child conflict frequency.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=74&blog_id=205,54,2014,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Differential Labor Regime of Repressiveness: The Political Economy of Chinese Labor Law Governance in Taiwanese Factories,Chih-Peng CHENG,"Chinese Labor Law (Chinese Labor Contract Law), Global Commodity Chains, Corporate Governance, Differential Labor Regime of Repressiveness, Welfare Regime","Emphasizing relations between state and society, the author examines Chinese labor laws from a global supply chain perspective, highlighting the roles of international buyers and Taiwanese investors in their interactions with labor laws. State-driven labor laws in post-socialist China are regarded as state policies in opposition to capitalist market power. However, transnational capitalists (rather than the state and workers) unexpectedly serve as key actors influencing labor policies. Further, labor contract laws are perceived as differential situations by international buyers and local governments. By re- analyzing relations among the state, workers, and capitalists according to their positions in the current Chinese economic transition, the author introduces the concept of “differential labor regime of repressiveness” to explain how and why labor law outcomes are both differential and insufficiently regulated.

Ethnic Status Inheritance in Aboriginal-Han Marriages and Families,"Chien-Chia LIU, Ying-Hwa CHANG","Bi-Ethnic Children, Intermarriage, Indigenous Status Identification, Census","During the past two decades, the children of marriages between Han Chinese and indigenous residents of Taiwan have become increasingly flexible in terms of determining their ethnic status. Before the “Status Act for Indigenous Peoples” was passed by the Taiwan Legislative Yuan in 2001, the administrative regulations on the status identification for indigenous peoples had been revised several times, but few efforts have been made to address the impacts of the revisions before 2000 on interethnic marriages and children. Here we use paired parent-child data from the 2000 Republic of China Census to examine the effects of complex family and social contexts on these children’s ethnic status choices. Our main findings are (a) the probability of bi-ethnic children inheriting indigenous status from their mothers decreased after the implementation of more flexible administrative regulation on ethnic identification for indigenous peoples in 1991. The impacts of institutional changes are not reflected in the ethnic inheritances of children because of their parents’ reluctance and negative social atmosphere, (b) in accordance with the patriarchal custom of determining descent through the father’s family line, children born in bi-ethnic marriages are more likely to inherit indigenous status via their indigenous fathers rather than their indigenous mothers. Nevertheless, some exception can be observed if the indigenous mother are more resourceful than the Han father in a family, (c) in contrast to families living in non-aboriginal townships, inter-ethnic families residing in aboriginal townships are more likely to allow their children to inherit indigenous status due to social support and peer pressure, (d) the likelihood of inheriting indigenous status is higher in socially and economically disadvantage families. However, the effect of instrumental purpose on inheriting indigenous status is not as strong as people expected since the disadvantageous families identifies in this study are small in number, and (e) the impacts of ethnic intermarriage on ethnic cohesion and identity in elite families is deserving of further study.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=74&blog_id=203,54,2014,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Does Moral Economy Have A Chance in Consumer Society？A Proposal to Reconfigure Theory Beyond the Substantive／Formal Dichotomy,Lu-Lin CHENG,"Consumption, Moral Economy, Ethics, Economic Conflict","Though theoretically charming, Bauman’s pessimistic answer to the question, “Does ethics have a chance in a world of consumers?” fails to explain widespread global conflicts that are triggered by ethical concerns of consumers. Instead, Miller and Barnett’s empirical researches, both based on the assumption that economic actors are consistently moral beyond specific contexts, support a better grasp of these phenomena. However, the liminal status between Miller’s “ordinary consumption” and Barnett’s “politicized consumption” remains under-explained, which unfortunately weakens an alternative vision of moral consumption against the neo-liberal establishment. In this paper we argue that here is exactly where moral economy could play a critical role in contemporary debates. However, to build on this potential, the standard moral economy framework requires three theoretical adjustments. This theoretical reconfiguration will also help to embed moral economy in an updated family of literature that improves its inner consistency and external validity. We end the article by demonstrating how a deductive extension of this updated framework supports moral economy to re-engage in controversies involving contemporary consumer conflicts.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=74&blog_id=202,54,2014,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

In this paper I draw on ethnographic information on homeless people in the W district of Taipei to address these ideas. Homeless people (which Bauman refers to as the “new poor”) not only represent a population of individuals who are excluded from the labor market, but also consumers who cannot satisfy their individual needs and desires. In reference to the underclass, homeless people include marginalized citizens, the working poor, and people who engage in deviant behaviors—roles needed for boundary maintenance. As deficient consumers, some of the homeless people may be given work in place of relief subsidies, and thus experience degradation in collective consumption. Some become flâneurs who escape from their families and travel within their home cities.

Neo-liberal Shifts in Interventionist States: Petrochemical Policies and the Ideational Embeddedness of Technocracy in Mexico and Taiwan,Fu-Chuan HUANG,"petrochemical industry, technocracy, industrial policy, PEMEX, CPC","In the mid-1980s, both Mexico and Taiwan made changes from interventionist state to market-led growth strategies. Despite convergence in the market reform policies, divergence is noted in their economic performances. The argument is made that economic outcomes are determined by the policy principles of technocracies, which are shaped by perceptions of market ideas and development consciousness and constrained by historically specific institutions. The Mexican case shows how a neo-classical economic technocracy can prioritize market ideas, but in a manner that is heavily offset by petroleum-centered ideology. In contrast, Taiwanese engineering technocracy remains development-conscious, projecting technical knowledge to policy-making processes, and using reverse integration history as a niche for forging industrial integration.

According to this view, actors serve as embedded agents operating within material and relational structural fields. I therefore also examine the political economy of rural Java to determine how the moral obligations and moral rights of Javanese migrant women revolve around the moral economies of families, thus contributing to the involution of Javanese rural women in transnational movements.

The entrapment hypothesis argues that nonstandard work either “traps” workers in nonstandard jobs or leads to unemployment. The bridge hypothesis claims that nonstandard work provides bridges to standard jobs. We used data from the 2008-2012 Manpower Utilization Quasi-Longitudinal Survey to determine which hypothesis is prevalent in Taiwanese labor markets. Our findings support the entrapment hypothesis. Although labor market segmentation is reflected in differences in mobility and wage patterns between standard and nonstandard workers, we also found heterogeneity within the nonstandard worker group.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=73&blog_id=198,55,2014,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Social Participation Effects on Civic Consciousness: Voluntary Associations and Daily Contacts,Yang-Chih FU,"social participation, voluntary associations, daily contact, civil society","Recent studies indicate a steady decline in voluntary association membership in Taiwan, which may hinder civil societal development. However, these studies have paid little attention to the role of informal social interactions. Using data from the Taiwan Social Change Survey, I examine voluntary association membership trends vis-à-vis the degree of daily contacts, which I argue is a more encompassing type of social participation. Similar to joining voluntary associations, daily contacts are positively associated with the survey respondents’ political efficacy, discussion of public issues, and normative perceptions of citizens’ duties and obligations. The extent of daily contacts has remained high since the late twentieth century, although with some changing patterns. In particular, contacts with unknown others increased between 1997 and 2010, indicating more fleeting social interactions. The findings suggest a diversifying pattern of social participation that probably reflects macro-level trends in new technology, social media, and globalization.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=73&blog_id=197,55,2014,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

The authors use a Bourdieusian feminist approach to analyze how class distinctions within gender are (re)produced and the power logics underlying such distinctions. The nature of domestically violent men is inscribed with meanings of (working) class specificity for maintaining middle-class ‘purity’. In its analysis of men’s multiple and conflicting experiences, this paper contributes to research on domestically violent men by challenging the monolithic and stereotype of male abusers.

Results show that, after controlling the effects of human capital, working condition, and family structure and family resources, a wage penalty of 1.5 and 2.1 percent per child is reported for Taiwanese women in terms of within-individual trajectory changes and between-individual comparisons, respectively. Results also reveal that human capital is the primary factor that explains motherhood wage penalty. Work characteristics and family resources also have significant effects on the wages of Taiwanese women.

The author adopts propensity score adjustment (PSA) to estimate Internet usage based on data collected from a 2008 telephone sample. Comparisons were made among post-stratification, raking, post-stratification PSA, and raking PSA. Stratification was used to produce PS weights and to compare estimated Internet usage for seven sub-classifications. The Taiwanese Social Change Survey conducted during the same period was used as the reference sample for PSA, while official statistics based on a Digital Divide Survey as the benchmark for bias reduction comparisons. Results indicate that (a) Internet usage estimates based on PSA adjusted according to base weight (i.e., survey weight from post-stratification or raking) using five sub-classes were more accurate than other estimates, and (b) bias reduction based on PSA adjusted by raking exceeded that of PSA adjusted by post-stratification.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=72&blog_id=193,56,2015,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

All three are based on critiques of structure-agency dualism. Each researcher has adopted a position prone to agency autonomy and active mediation, while abandoning the ossified structure concept. They describe structure in terms of multi-layered and dynamic processes and relationships. In contrast, I use a critical realist perspective to argue that excessive preference for action and a non-substantive structural concept, as well as the elimination of structure-agency dualism, might result in overlooking inertia and the latent force of a structure, thus leading to structure under-theorization.

Existing theories (e.g., neocolonialism, cultural imperialism, and soft power) describe American power as indirect, hidden, and involving ideological indoctrination. The evidence suggests that while America made use of Hong Kong and Taiwanese literature, it was not directly involved in producing content. This study uses state-private and interpersonal networks to explore the complex relationships between the holders and intermediaries of American power, which used cultural and economic capital to dilute the political content of messages. Unlike previous studies, this one asserts that unattributed power hoped to convey anti-communism messages by weaving them into symbol systems.

Data from the 2011 Taiwan Social Change Survey were used to test the health-enhancing resource hypothesis and the status syndrome hypothesis. Results indicate that social standing affects health and mediates most of the effects of education and income on health. We also compared country-specific patterns based on East Asia Social Surveys, and found that in all countries, education, income and social standing exert significant effects on health. After adjusting for education and income, social standing effects were found to be significant for all nations except South Korea.

Drawing on regime analysis from science, technology, and social science studies, this paper examines how nursing practices enact the biomedical realities of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Taiwan, and discusses their ontological implications. In order to address CKD in the daily lives of patients, nurses use a “maintain and compete” subjectification strategy by linking and integrating existing clinical and social practices. They connect their patients’ social, interactional, cognitive and motivational modes of existence by reinterpreting complex medical indexes and clinical guidelines into simple language, help their patients make necessary adaptations in their daily lives to deal with CKD, address institutional and practical problems, and supervise the use of alternative therapies.

Such an effort challenges a binary ethnic stereotype based on cultural homogeneity.

Institutional Impacts and Density Dependence in Taiwan’s Higher Education Development,Jian-Jhou CHEN,"higher education, institutionalism, density dependence","The dynamic graphic for higher education development in Taiwan since 1950 is similar to the demonstration of density dependence. However, since that development was not based on an open competitive market, it is worth discussing whether density dependence is the best explanation for the resulting development pattern. This study uses a combination of institutionalism and density dependence to address this question. Study results indicate that higher education development in Taiwan was directly affected by the country’s education policy, even though a dynamic graphic of that development indicates density dependence in different contexts. The data also indicate that departmental expansion patterns (both imitation and reproduction) were directly influenced by institutional factors, with evidence of mortality and transformation prior to declining enrollment. My conclusion is that density dependence is not available as an explanatory factor in the development of higher education in Taiwan, and that an institutional perspective provides a more complete explanation.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=70&blog_id=180,58,2015,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

To consolidate its legitimacy, the KMT controlled all decisions involving post-secondary education leadership and resource distribution. Crises associated with an authoritative state were the main drivers behind academic regime transformation, with dual regimes being created and enforced. As a result, all public university administrators were male, with Mainland Chinese roots, and with doctorates in science or engineering earned at foreign universities. After the lifting of martial law, the numbers and percentages of Taiwanese-origin university presidents increased, and the influence of military backgrounds decreased. KMT domination continues at private universities, although there are signs of increasing diversity within education power groups.

These gardens are being targeted for elimination as local government agencies make plans to use the space for recreational purposes. The farmers have taken some actions in protest, but they are clearly the weaker party in this disagreement, underscoring the idea that riverside vegetable gardens are no longer perceived as legitimate uses of riverfront spaces and wetlands. Instead, cultivators are being stigmatized for using public space for inappropriate purposes.

The Panel Study of Family Dynamics surveyed was used to establish the fertility behavior survival model. The results indicate that purchasing houses at soaring prices will take up more household resources causing a stronger crowding- out effect of houses on children, and thereby reducing the occurrence rate of fertility leading to the phenomenon of “dare not have children after buying a house”. On the other hand, when considering houses as the precondition factor of child-bearing, the situation of “no house no children” will occur.

The data indicate two major findings. First, higher- paying job opportunities increased at the beginning of the time period and then decreased, exactly the opposite of the trend for lower-paying job opportunities. Second, post-industrialization has contributed to increased job polarization, especially divisions within the service sector.

Based on participant observations and interviews, I discuss how Chinese Christian college students maintain their faith within such restrictions. I found that they are not struggling in a zero-sum religion-versus-science game, but successfully reconciling the two by manifesting a two-layered religious reflexivity. When interacting with non-believers, they adjust their elaborations on relationships among science, religion and superstition to maintain a religious identity and to facilitate evangelism.

"Becoming “Thao”: Genetic Science, Identity Construction and the Thao Aboriginal Movement",Yu-Yueh TSAI,"genetics, aborigines, identity politics, strategic scientific essentialism, ethnicity","Using the name rectification movement of the Thao people in Taiwan as an example, this article analyzes how name rectification activists used human genome research to achieve their re-naming goal. I use historical and field data to argue that Thao ethnic activists used DNA evidence as an example of “strategic scientific essentialism” in Thao identity formation. After the Thao were officially recognized by the Taiwan government in 2001, DNA evidence was deemphasized compared to land ownership, the establishment of a Thao national council, and the promotion of Thao language learning in the construction of Thao ethnicity. This shift from strategic scientific essentialism to strategic scientific de-essentialism confirms that ethnic identity is not primordial, but a product shaped by social and political change. The Thao’s successful re-naming campaign demonstrates how genetic knowledge can generate significant social effects on resource access and power redistribution by shaping ethnic identity and differences.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=66&blog_id=158,62,2017,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Gender Practices and Work Identities of Returned Female Domestic Migrant Workers During Taiwan’s Industrialization Era,Su-Chiu CHEN,"Female labor, industrialization in Taiwan, mobility, domestic migrant worker, work identity","This article has two goals: to supplement historical records of women’s working experiences and their urban life experiences during Taiwan’s industrialization era, and to respond to the debate on how women’s labor market participation affected their resistance to patriarchal norms. This article refutes the argument that Taiwanese women’s participation in 1960-70s labor markets did not lead to significant changes in their family statuses. By analyzing working experiences under different conditions, it instead argues that less insulated and repressive working conditions provided female migrant workers with greater mobility in urban spaces, allowing them to develop strategies for acquiring resources to challenge established gender roles. This article also contends that Taiwanese women who developed positive work identities in urban spaces before returning to rural areas did in fact resist existing patriarchal norms. However, successful change was often delayed until the power and control of the elder generation on the husband side declines.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=66&blog_id=157,62,2017,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Historic Turn of Taiwanese Social Change Studies: Rethinking Totalizing Holism and Historical Narrative Degradation,Chih-Ming KA,"Taiwanese social change, historic turn, narrative, contingency, agency","The historic turn of post-war Taiwanese social change studies has experienced two ruptures: exile from knowledge communities, and a split with knowledge traditions. The exile resulted domestically in the delegation of social change studies to “Taiwanese anthropology,” while internationally a delinking from the historic turn trend in the social sciences. The split occurred at two levels: methodology and the conception of social existence. The first has prolonged the ongoing slight of narrative as the epistemological other, and the second has contributed to the invisibility of contingency and agency, rendering both as ontological anomalies. Rethinking the insufficient historicization and the over-totalizing holism in Taiwanese social change studies, the author argues for candid dialogue between structure-oriented and action-oriented studies as well as cultural studies and political economy, believing that direct engagement will result in more productive relationships. He also encourages localized social change studies as well as the adoption of hegemonic regime concept.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=62&blog_id=154,63,2018,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

In contrast to existing studies that tend to systematically marginalize this system and book distributors, I clarify the roles of distribution middlemen and their social relations with other agents. In this study, a conception of “publishing circuits of commerce” was constructed as analyzing framework. The findings suggest that the institutions and embedded relationships in these circuits reinforce overproduction and imbalances in supply and demand via tightly embedded commercial ties. Further, financial embeddedness through the institutions such as the preservation accounts, the “monthly checkout and payment system” constitute a kind of overembeddeness, which ossifies the commercial linkages of the production, distribution, and sales sectors in the publishing circuits of commerce, thus intensifying inefficiencies in this industry.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=62&blog_id=153,63,2018,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Beautifully Islam: The Rise of “Hijabers Community” and Affective Agency in Central Java,En-Chieh Chao,"piety, beauty, Islam, women, affective agency","The so-called “Hijabers Community” is an Indonesian religious movement that is led by young Muslim women who advocate faith and fashion simultaneously. While the scholarly literature on the hijab or the Islamic headscarf has explored themes on postcolonial resistance, local modernity, public piety, gendered class anxiety, and the pursuit of virtue, it surprisingly overlooks the topic of beauty. This paper privileges the viewpoint of members of “Hijabers Salatiga” in Central Java in order to argue that the Hijabers movement represents a mode of affective agency that connects stylish bodies with pious veilling and charitable activities, two previously unrelated domains in Indonesia. Importantly, Hijabers’ aesthetics are characterized by unfinished-ness and openness, and therefore cannot be explained by functionalist accounts. The cultural trends and social effects of the Hijabers movement remind us that, in a globalizing era of religious revivals, sociologists and anthropologists should seriously consider religious movements outside of explicitly feminist and political agendas. Understanding this novel trend not only supports perceptions of modern Muslim women’s creativity, but also illustrates Deleuze’s concept of “the affective” — an increasingly prominent theme in the humanities and social sciences.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=63&blog_id=150,64,2018,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

We argue that Taiwan Biobank, as an example of absent publics and a model of expert scientism governance, could not reflect civic epistemologies because it had no institutional mechanisms for including multiple publics. Social scientists and NGOs have become public representatives challenging Biobank problems. Initially, scientists regarded dissenters as anti-science and irrational, resulting in the neglect of diverse values underlying public challenges, and in restrictions on innovative governance practices. Since Taiwan Biobank lacked an ＂upstream public engagement＂ mechanism, actors used the media to voice opinions without resolving conflicts.

REACH legislation in the EU has encouraged new regulations on chemical usage in countries such as Taiwan, where the Toxic Chemical Substances Control Act has undergone amendments since 2011. This study explores dynamic relations among environmental groups, enterprises, and the law-making state. It is noted that the electronics industry, which requires the intensive use of chemicals, was in a similar position in dealing with environmental groups to support the Taiwanese version of REACH. However, the extent to which amendments to the law reflect precautionary values relies on alternating conflict and compromise between market and social forces rather than the simple goodwill of the market.

Does Multi-Channel College Admission System Benefit the Upper Middle Class?,Ko-Hua Yap,"multi-channel admission, socioeconomic status, urban-rural differences, academic performance","Scholars are increasingly using administrative data to determine whether multi-channel college admission system benefits the upper middle class. However, administrative data lack information about family background, and such research usually replaces it with the regional characteristics. One problem is that regional characteristics and family background operate at two different levels. A measure supportive of rural students does not necessarily benefit the students from low socioeconomic-status families. Moreover, even if an admission channel favors a certain type of student, it shouldn’t automatically be considered unfair. A bias favoring upper middle class students should mean that they are admitted due to overestimation for the academic ability or matching degree. It is necessary to use social surveys to collect information on the family backgrounds of students.

Passionate Science and Economic Sluggishness: A Heterogeneous Network Perspective of Taiwan’s Bio- and Patent Economies,Tzung-Wen Chen,"bioeconomy, patent economy, heterogeneous network, economic psychology, actor-network theory","Asset-based bioeconomies are supposed to be dependent on patent economies, but few efforts have been made to understand how patent economies are relevant to bioeconomies, especially from a sociological perspective. This paper uses a heterogeneous network approach based on Gabriel Tarde’s Psychologie économique (with reference to actor- network theory) to analyze Taiwanese biomedical patents. Elements of heterogeneous networks (patent inventors, applicants, agents, examiners, and entrepreneurs) are approached as participants in network conversations aimed at constructing scopes and contents of each patent, thereby accumulating patent numbers. At least two network configuration modes are believed to be relevant to Taiwanese patent construction: outward linguistic and inward linguistic. The findings indicate that the dominant mode in Taiwan is not necessarily oriented toward a mainstream, asset-based bioeconomy, but that a domestic bioeconomy status is still pending while waiting for the co-construction of various heterogeneous network modes.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=64&blog_id=156,65,2019,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

I find that phong trào (trend), triggered by remittances sent via marriage migrants and intergenerational family contracts, and its consequence of collective illusions provide the most important mechanisms in Taiwanese-Vietnamese match-made marriages. Further, linguistic challenges, discontent regarding expectations of intimacy, incivil attention, and negative transnationalism exacerbate the suffering experiences of Vietnamese marriage migrants.

As market devices, P2P platforms transform lay practitioners (lenders) into agents who rationally calculate risk and expected returns using information on credit ratings, default protection policies, diversified portfolio models, and legal advice. Although the P2P lending market in Taiwan is not illegal, it has yet to achieve institutional legitimacy, mostly because platforms and transactions are not regulated, supervised, or assured by the state, which makes it different from all other financial institutions and transactions. The lenders’ trust of platforms is a foundation of the P2P lending market and calculative socio- technic agencements.

"Taiwan’s Neoliberal Moment: Crisis, Paradigm Competition and the Ascent of Neoclassical Economists",Chuan-Wei Hsia,"neoliberalism, developmental state, historical institutionalism, policy paradigm","This article focuses on the neglected role of neoclassical economists who used opportunities created by two oil crises in the 1970s and macroeconomic imbalances in the 1980s to successfully promote a new interpretive framework. The framework facilitated a comprehensive liberalization policy that dictated government policymaking from the periphery. A historical institutionalist perspective is used to argue that political leaders adopted neoliberalism as a practical problem-solving tool in response to the failure of the developmental paradigm to cope with political and economic crises in the 1980s, since neoliberalism exhibited both economic and political viability. However, a lack of administrative viability resulted in neoliberal ideas being compromised and their implementation being checked by nationalist and conservative factions.

Most studies deemphasize how these mothers negotiate social constraints to reconstructing their maternal and professional identities. Data from interviews with 19 academic mothers are used to examine conflicting gendered roles involving work demands and family expectations. Features of three negotiation strategies are analyzed: body/mind management that supports performance and avoids overwork, the use of academic capital to reframe cultural ideals of motherhood, and the appropriation of mothering knowledge in support of innovative research energy. The latter two characterize what I call intellectual mothering. This study challenges the dual presumptions of the “family-work balance model,” which overlooks the interplay between academic work and family life.

East Asian countries have relatively low social spending budgets, but their young adults are at lower poverty risk compared to their Western counterparts. Using data from the Luxembourg Income Study for 25 industrialized countries, we examined the effects of macro- and micro-level factors on young adult poverty risk. Household composition was identified as a key factor connecting high social expenditures and high youth poverty levels. When household characteristics are held constant, East Asian young adults are more likely to fall below the poverty line compared to young adults in Nordic countries, indicating household economy as an important Confucian welfare state safety net. Overall social expenditures and lower pro-elderly social spending correlated negatively with young adult poverty risk.

Results indicate a decline in core network confidants from 4.6 to 2.9, and an increase in degree of social isolation from 3% to 19%. Methodological and substantive explanations for these findings are discussed. Possible methodological artifacts include interviewer effect, respondent responsiveness, and questionnaire design, but in our view these do not represent complete explanations. We identified several rapid changes in demographics and social factors that might account for the core network decline, including aging population, high divorce rate, low fertility rate, growing education differentials, and increased female labor force participation.

Studies indicate that mothers engage in public affairs based on the cultural idea of unconditional love, and reframe their maternal experiences into political advocacy. However, some scholars contest that these images reinforce patriarchal structures. To challenge the prevailing perception of lived experience and political action, I used a “subject in process” viewpoint that emphasizes the dynamic interweaving of care work and political engagement. According to data from eighteen interviews with members of the Taiwan Parks & Playgrounds for Children by Children, plus personal observations of that organization over two years, I found that young urban mothers connected their care work with policy advocacy by mobilizing parental support networks to construct a “counter public sphere,” and to produce alternative discourses to resist mainstream playground design policies. At the same time, their everyday practice of care work is reshaped by their political advocacy followed by the experience of exclusion in government settings. The emergence of a new mother-citizen subject not only alters these mothers’ self- recognition but also reframes the image of mothers among other people in the public sphere.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=111&blog_id=444,67,2020,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

To “rediscover” their faiths, the author proposes a believer-centered perspective that emphasizes religious practices. Two ethnographic examples are considered: Protestant worship gatherings and folk-belief parades. A discussion is offered on ways that religious authorities use diverse strategies within these activities to create “ideal” homeless participants, imposing symbolic violence involving discriminatory practices based on the perceived personal capabilities and morality of the homeless. Furthermore, I illustrate how the homeless respond via “co-operation without consensus,” in religious practices imbued with their own meanings, thereby transforming a give-andtake relationship into one of reciprocity that subverts the status of the poor. Homeless individuals may use a combination of wuxia novels, glove puppetry, and religious traditions to create a detailed identity for a charismatic “hidden dragon” that descends to this world to deliver salvation. More than just resistance against symbolic violence, what they’ve done display an agency in which the homeless pursue equal status by/as gods.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=112&blog_id=450,68,2020,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Bourdieusian field theory is used to unpack multi-dimensional power trajectories in transnational sex tourism from a relational perspective. The paper demonstrates how power dynamics between clients and sex workers are shaped by multiple factors, including the amount and portfolio content of an individual’s sexual capital, the ways that the sexual field valorizes sexual capital, and the manifold relationality that bridges the two. Associated relationalities include the offsetting, converting, and triggering of interrelations among different forms of sexual capital possessed by individuals, subtle confrontational relations associated with sexual capital portfolios, and relations between individual attributes and their situated social contexts. These relations arguably determine the value of sexual capital in different forms and the way in which they operate, which heavily influence sex worker-client power dynamics.",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=112&blog_id=452,68,2020,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology

Few efforts have been made to investigate how shareholders perceive these contractual relationships. This study examines an unsuccessful case involving oyster farming, in which an artificial propagation technique was created and transferred but unsuccessfully marketed. While Taiwanese oyster farmers still prefer naturally collected spat, the company receiving the patent experienced significant difficulty in selling its product. This study uses actor-network theory with framing and overflow concepts to show how actor cognition and knowledge are shaped by local context, resulting in situations where technology transfer contracts may fail to deal with the overflows.

This paper uses the concept of “anticipatory work” to explore the nature of team-based palliative care work, including scientific predictions, affective forces, and care practices.

Three time frames were identified as central to palliative care team work: patient survival, medical institution regulations, and patient life trajectories, respectively representing clinical, institutional and social time frames. Palliative care teams estimate life expectancy, communicate predictions with patients and families, and enact care practices to minimize suffering, thus providing ways for patients and families to anticipate death and act in the present. To demonstrate the relevance of anticipatory work, this paper reframes palliative care as one in which individuals expect future progress while anticipating completion in the form of “good deaths.”",https://www.tjs.org.tw/page.php?menu_id=7&blog_class2_id=113&blog_id=473,69,2021,Taiwanese Journal of Sociology
Populism and Anti-Elite Sentiments in Taiwan: An Analysis of the World Values Survey Data,"Ming-Chang Tsai, Hsin-Hsin Pan","populism, latent class analysis, political trust, social prejudice","We conceptualize populism in Taiwan as endorsing anti-elite sentiments, which comprise popular sovereignty, anti-elitism, sincere people, and strong leadership. Based on the 2019 Taiwan dataset of the World Values Survey, we use the latent class analysis to differentiate respondents into three groups: the weak, mild, and strong populists. We find that approximately one-third of Taiwanese is weak populists who expect more power elites’ attention, 54% is mild populists, who voice their policy concerns but feel disregarded by power elites, and one-eighth is the strong populists with the highest score on all four dimensions of anti-elite sentiments. Because both the mild and strong populists sum up to two-thirds of the adult population, a large majority seems to hold an anti-elite sentiment. The outcomes from our further analysis of the social-economic and demographic backgrounds of the populists suggest that strong populism is positively associated with perceived economic insecurity and support for the KMT party. Moreover, populists tend to believe that elites and the government are corrupt, register a low level of political trust, and discriminate against homosexuals, people with HIV, and immigrants.

Generational Identity and Historical Narrative: The Emergence of the “Back-to-Reality” Generation in 1970s Taiwan,A-chin Hsiau,"identity, narrative, generation, back-to-reality, nationalism","The author uses a combination of narrative identity theory and Karl Mannheim’s theory of generation to a) analyze the emergence of a “backto-reality” generation in 1970s Taiwan and b) examine the relationship between their back-to-reality ideas and generational identity. Taiwan’s major diplomatic failures in the early 1970s awakened young intellectuals (both Taiwanese natives and the children of mainland Chinese) to new challenges facing the country. They relied on a modern Chinese nationalist historical narrative to make sense of the situation and to promote a sense of duty to the country among other members of their generation, attacking the prevailing sojourn mentality and supporting back-to-reality ideas and socio-political reforms. The author shows that the frame of reference for generational identity was a nationalist historical narrative, within which intellectuals positioned themselves and struggled to make sense of their generation’s meaning of existence. Their attempts to act out their philosophy qualify them as Taiwan’s “back-to-reality” generation. I offer an analysis of how a generational identity shaped by a nationalist historical narrative evolved into a primary motivation for historical actors, noting that generational consciousness was a function of specific social change, which in turn became an agency that facilitated further social change. In this situation, generation--a conceptual category through which the awakening back-to-reality generation understood self and society and articulated its socio-political reformism--was a historical phenomenon in which subjective agency and objective environmental conditions were of equal significance. It is important to study this generation’s discourses and actions as remote origins of the indigenization or Taiwanization of contemporary Taiwanese politics and culture.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-9/9-1-sum.pdf,9,2005,Taiwanese Sociology
From Chinese Original Domicile to Taiwanese Ethnicity: An Analysis of Census Category Transformation in Taiwan,Fu-chang Wang,"population census, original domicile, ethnicity, ethnic categorization","The two purposes of this article are to a) identify the historical, social, and political processes behind the formation and transformation of ethnic categorization in Taiwan’s population census procedures, and b) to locate the position of ethnic categorization in the political and social systems of postwar Taiwan. The author describes how ethnic characteristics in the general population were categorized by the Republic of China (ROC) government across seven censuses conducted between 1956 and 2000, then uses the data to propose a four-stage transformation. An explanatory framework of political institution re-construction by Mainland Chinese in Taiwan during the postwar era is offered to position the role and function of ethnic categorization. The author argues that categorizing people in terms of their geographic origins in China or Taiwan was institutionalized by the ROC government under the banner of “Chinese national imagination” to meet the political goals of unifying people and claiming legitimacy for its efforts to retake the mainland. Categorization played an important role in the temporary political institutions that were established by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) regime to claim that it was still the legitimate ruler of China. However, categorization also revealed the regime’s lack of trust in the Taiwanese people to show loyalty to the Chinese nation, which the government suggested was the result of five decades of Japanese colonial rule. The end result was an institution in which Taiwanese were under-represented both politically and culturally. After 1971 (when international support for the KMT regime declined), Chinese national ideology came under intense internal challenge, with the emerging opposition advocating an alternative Taiwanese national imagination. According to demands for ethnic equality, temporary political arrangements were interpreted by opposition groups as institutions of ethnic discrimination against Taiwanese. The transformation of categorization from Chinese “original domicile” to Taiwanese “ethnicity” entailed not only a change in imagined societal boundaries, but also in ideal patterns of inter-group relations within the society. The original domicile categorization system was eventually abolished after major institutional changes occurred in the early 1990s. The author addresses the circumstances under which the ethnicity concept became salient in Taiwan, and how it was used to counteract a nationalist discourse rather than an explicit racist ideology. Thus, ethnic relations in Taiwan developed concurrently with a dispute over national identity, rather than within a less controversial national boundary",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-9/9-2-sum.pdf,9,2005,Taiwanese Sociology
"Channeling Sensus Communis: An Analysis of the Rhetorical Models in the Public Sphere of the Lin-he Community, Taiwan","Jieh-min Wu, Ding-tzann Lii","public sphere, rhetorical model, sensus communis, democratization, local faction","The Habermasian concept of public sphere has been criticized for its repression of “sentimental moments” and “differences in identities.” To avoid the analytical predicament incurred by Habermas’s discursive model, the author proposes a rhetorical model of public sphere in order to explore issues associated with the construction of a local public sphere from the perspective of conversational practices. When public reasoning is viewed as a process of rhetorical action and interaction, all aspects constituting public social conversation (including place, occasion, atmosphere, timing, tone, gesture and posture) should be carefully documented and analyzed. This idea is inspired by Giambattista Vico’s concept of sensus communis, or “common sense,” which plays a crucial role in channeling social trust--the sentimental pillar of the nascent public sphere. According to a rhetorical model, a good communicator should be able to integrate argument and public performance with “pure reasoning,” thus being able to form a community’s conflicting identities, interests, and opinions into a state of the “common mind” as expressed by Charles Taylor. The author uses a local community situation in Taiwan to illustrate the significance of the art of reasoning, especially for those who intend to put the public sphere into practice in a community marked by partisan competition.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-9/9-3-sum.pdf,9,2005,Taiwanese Sociology
The Conceptualization and Operation of Social Capital: Time Investment in Overlapping Networks,Yang-chih Fu,"social capital, personal networks, network overlapping, time investment, contact diary","Conceptualizing the study of social capital relies on untangling the various mechanisms that help accumulate and capitalize social resources. Based on the social network perspective, this paper first clarifies the core concepts associated with social capital and differentiates its major components. It then examines how actors gain from investing different amounts of time in social interactions within three kinds of networks: highly overlapping networks, somewhat overlapping networks, and those that do not overlap. The data were drawn from two contact diaries (with 2,233 and 1,555 contacts, respectively), which recorded the actual amount of time each contact lasted, the immediate returns from each contact, the sociodemographics of both the ego and the alter, and the relationship between the two actors. The findings indicate that, under similar sociodemographic, relational, and contact circumstances, the ego tends to experience more expressive and substantial gains when a contact lasts longer. Such a duration effect disappears, however, when either actor knows the other’s family very well. This nuance suggests that overlapping networks are usually richer in social capital, thus actors feel a less urgent need to invest time when they wish to obtain immediate returns, as other studies also have shown. As an objective, standardized, and universal unit, time investment is easy to measure. More importantly, not only does time investment vary significantly on different individual and relational factors, it also clearly differentiates how actors perceive and evaluate each specific contact. Time investment is a key mechanism in social capital, particularly amid overlapping networks, and this measure helps showcase how social capital functions according to the network approach.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-9/9-4-sum.pdf,9,2005,Taiwanese Sociology
"Ethnicity, Gender and Class: Ethnic Difference in Taiwan's Educational Attainment Revisited",Wan-chi Chen,"ethnic group, gender, class, educational attainment","There has been a significant gap in educational attainment between mainlanders and other ethnic groups in Taiwan, especially in the early postwar years. Existing studies did not provide consistent answers about whether ethnicity has an effect on educational attainment, net of parents' education and socioeconomic background. Focusing on the probability of obtaining a bachelor degree, this study found that the mainlander effect varies not only with birth cohort but also with gender and class. The findings include: first, mainlander effect was significantly stronger among females than among males in the early years due to greater gender egalitarianism within the mainlander group. Second, whereas no ethnicity effect was observed among those from highly-educated families, the probability of attending college for mainlander offspring from lesseducated families was significantly higher than for other ethnic groups, even after further controlling for the ""public sector"" effect and the number of siblings. Ethnic difference in gender egalitarianism accounts for the early-year net effect to some degree. However, there are still some features left unexplained. Possible explanations to be explored include: language capital, social capital formed within mainlander villages, and new immigrants' atypical motivations.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-10/10-3-a.pdf,10,2005,Taiwanese Sociology
Conjugal Resources and the Household Division of Labor under Taiwanese Social Change: A Comparison between the 1970s and 1990s Social-Cultural Contexts,"Yu-hsia Lu, Chin-chun Yi","division of household labor, women's employment, conjugal resources, social change, gender norms","Based on an island-wide random sampling survey of married women, this article explores whether the effects of conjugal resources on the household division of labor vary between social-cultural contexts. Using retrospective data from 1970s and 1990s marriage cohorts, this paper compares the mechanisms of household labor allocation during the early stage of family development in these two groups. The findings indicate that the effects of conjugal resources on household labor allocation do not vary with the different social-cultural contexts of the 1970s and 1990s, in both contexts, the spouses' relative resources could be transformed to bargaining power affecting the household labor allocation. In addition, the effects of husbands' socioeconomic status in the two contexts suggest the influence of gender ideologies associated with particular classes and the persistence of class-gender norms. The evidence of the resource power effect and the persistence of class differences indicate the heterogeneity of the resource power mechanism, which varies with different socioeconomic contexts. The evidence does not support Rodman's theory that resources-power mechanism varies with social-cultural contexts of the social developmental stages. This may be attributed to the uniqueness of social developmental trajectories under Taiwan's particular socioeconomic and cultural contexts. Based on the study's findings, the adaptability of family change theories, which are rooted in the societal developmental paradigm, are discussed.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-10/10-1-a.pdf,10,2005,Taiwanese Sociology
Public Attitudes toward Taiwan's Immigration Policies,"Chih-jou Jay Chen, Te-lin Yu","immigration policies, Chinese immigrants, Vietnamese immigrants, public attitudes toward immigration","This paper examines the social factors that influence individuals' attitudes toward Taiwan's immigration policies. Since the early 1990s, Taiwan has witnessed the number of its ""bride immigrants,"" mainly from China and Vietnam, increase rapidly, thus drawing much attention and concern from policy makers and ordinary citizens. Based on data from a phone survey conducted in 2004, this paper finds (1) ethnicity and national identity both have significant effects on people's attitudes toward immigration policies for bride immigrants emanating from China and Southeast Asia, (2) party support and ethnic bias affect people's attitudes toward immigration policies for Chinese bride immigrants, but not for those from Southeast Asian countries, and (3) social context and cross-group contacts have little effect on people's attitudes regarding this issue. This paper shows that people's attitudes about social policies in Taiwan are shaped mainly by partisan competition and political rhetoric, instead of their economic self-interest and crossgroup contacts.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-10/10-2-a.pdf,10,2005,Taiwanese Sociology

"Labour, the Body, and Sexuality: Women Sex Workers' Negotiation of Public and Private Sex and Work",Mei-Hua Chen,"gender, sexuality, sex work, aesthetic labour, emotional labour","Feminists have been disputing the nature of commercial sex acts for nearly four decades. Some radical feminists argue that the existence of commercial sex signifies women's oppression and see prostitution as nothing but selling sex. In contrast, prostitutes' rights groups and pro-sex feminists tend to consider commercial sex acts as work or labour. The latter group, however, fails to elaborate the kinds of labour that are involved in commercial sex. Based on in-depth interviews with Taiwanese sex workers, I argue that sex workers are expected to perform aesthetic labour, alienated sexual labour, and (embodied) emotional labour in order to be recognized (and paid) as professional sex workers. Moreover, I argue that performing sex work involves multi-layered boundary negotiation. Many interviewees exercised ""role distance"" when performing sex work and differentiated work sex from their personal sexual intimacy. They expended great effort managing the boundary between sex and work because of the dangers associated with failing to do so. However, the dangers involved did not rule out their enjoying some specific sexual encounters with clients or falling in love with them.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-11/1-2.pdf,11,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
The Risk Governance of SARS: Beyond the Technical Model,"Chia-Ling Wu, Yen-Fen Tseng","risk governance, SARS, scientific uncertainty, STS","This article discusses the linkages between scientific knowledge and risk governance from the perspectives of science, technology, and society studies (STS), by investigating the formations and transformations of two major SARS prevention measures -- a travel advisory issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a home quarantine issued by the Taiwanese government. Moving beyond the ""technical model"" that emphasizes a one-way, linear relation between science and risk governance, we offer three alternative perspectives: (1) The interest model: Stakeholders act based on their own group interests, which have a strong impact on their interpretations of scientific ""facts"" and their choice of governance policies. (2) The social production of scientific knowledge: The investigation centers on the social contexts of knowledge production, which may share the same social and cultural space as policy-making. (3) Scientific uncertainty stimulated by policymaking: Such literature stresses that policies like precautionary measures not only serve as a strategy for managing scientific uncertainty, but also intensify or trigger scientific uncertainty. Based on the three perspectives, first we argue that by adopting a travel advisory, the WHO enhanced its legitimacy of governing global risk, by issuing a home quarantine, public health authorities attempted to lessen its political crisis. Second, the administrative regions produced the descriptive epidemiology of SARS, and thus arbitrary geographic lines became the boundaries of travel advisories. The epidemiological data presentation emphasizes the transmission between patients and neglects the image of ""contacting but not being infected,"" thus intensifying the need for home quarantine. Third, the controversy about the criteria for lifting the travel advisory and identifying the people who need quarantine shows the limitations of reducing uncertainties when implementing precautionary principles. Moreover, the policies that follow such principles often generate new uncertainties. To analyze such dynamics, there is a need to bring ""social"" perspectives into research on scientific governance. The endeavour calls for further breaking down the academic division of labour between those who choose to focus on the social and those who focus on the scientific.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-11/1-3.pdf,11,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
After the Developmentalist Illusion: The Taiwanese Auto Industry and the Theory of the Trans-border Industrial Field,Lu-Lin Cheng,"trans-border industrial field, learning/control duality, economic sociology, developmental sociology, globalization","This article proposes a theory of developmental sociology called the ""Trans-border Industrial Field"" (TBIF), which offers an analytic framework with three research foci: an asymmetric interdependence between global firms and local firms, the duality of learning/control as revealed in their interactions, and the underlying product architecture of the specific industrial fields in which they reside. The theory's merits are demonstrated on two related levels of analysis. First, a critical review of the theoretical evolution in developmental sociology pinpoints a missing theoretical space that is vital to the discipline's valid response to the challenge of globalization and the advantages of the TBIF theory, compared with other relevant theories, are illustrated. Second, the TBIF theory is applied to the Taiwanese auto industry to show how it can overcome the weakness of alternative theories and better explain the complex dynamics of the industry's recent development, after the existing theory announced that such development was an ""illusion.""",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-11/1-4.pdf,11,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
"Friendship Network Characteristics, Interaction Context Structure, and Friendship Dynamics among Adolescents","Yeu-Sheng Hsieh, Chyi-In Wu, Man Kit Lei","friendship characteristics, interaction context structure, friendship dynamics, friendship similarity, attribute similarity, behavioural similarity","While most previous studies focus on the effect of adolescents' characteristics on the friendship network and its structure, this study argues that both friendship network characteristics and the interaction context structure have significant effects on adolescents' friendship dynamics. It examines how the interaction context structure of friendship influences the effect of network characteristics on friendship dynamics. In this study, friendship network data from the 1996-1998 Panel Study of Taipei Youths is used to examine whether the friendship attributes and behavioural similarities of adolescents influence friendship changes and whether these effects vary across interaction contexts in terms of class size and class type to increase understanding of how adolescents' friendships evolve in a two-level conceptual framework. A two-stage cluster analysis is applied to characterize friends' change types and a two-level ordinal logit regression is utilized to investigate the research hypotheses. The results show that adolescents' friendship changes are dynamic rather than stable. The distribution of three ordinal types of friendship change varies by the interaction contexts and is influenced by class size or class type. Also, while the effect of friendship attribute similarity on friendship change is not significant, the effect of friendship behavioural similarity is somewhat prominent and is partially influenced by the interaction contexts as well. The findings indicate that friendship network characteristics and interaction context structure do have an influence on friendship dynamics among adolescents in Taiwan.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-11/1-5.pdf,11,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
Zhi-Ming and Chun-Jiau: Why Are Men's Names and Women's Names Always Different?,Kuang-Chun Li,"naming, market names, homology, disposition, symbolic violence","This paper provides a symbolic analysis of gender differences in names and naming, based on hospital registration data, which is used to plot the long-term pattern of gender differences in names in the 20th century. The most frequently used names for both men and women changed significantly over the years 1900-1999, but gender differences in names remained relatively stable. Giving the credit to Bourdieu's idea of symbolic violence, the persistent stability of gender difference/boundary in names can be explained as a consequence of disposition and the economy of symbolic goods. Disposition refers to a tendency for people to perceive and recognize ""natural"" names for men and for women. In addition, naming has symbolic power to produce symbolic capital, the distribution of which allocates symbolic capital to men and subordinates and marginalizes women. As a result, many arbitrary cultural differences, such as men's names and women's names, are perceived as ""natural"" and accepted without question. The persistent stability of gender differences in names can be observed at least in two aspects: one is a functional transfer from first namecharacter to second name-character, and the other is a symbolic derivation of homophonic names. This paper is relevant to gender studies, in that examining taken-for-granted aspects of gender differences in names can point to hidden paternalistic attitudes and gender stereotypes.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-12/1-2.pdf,12,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
Driftworks Ontology: An Ontological Exploration of Heamodialysis Patients' Modes of Existence and Action,Wen-Yuan Lin,"body, hemodialysis, action, ontology, driftworks","Equipped with patients' different ontological presumptions, structuralist, post-structuralist, phenomenological and hermeneutical, and action-oriented studies of medical practices reduce the phenomena of patients in action to issues of particular contexts. Based on fieldwork materials from interviews, an onsite ethnography, and documents that present the mediated existences of haemodialysis patients in action, this paper explores ""being in action"" and proposes an alternative ""driftworks"" ontology. This driftworks ontology is a means to investigating heterogeneous, mediated, and unfolding social existence in empirical experiences. Such an empirically based, dynamic ontology can transcend the antagonistic opposition of the individual and collective existences in social theory.

Reexploring the Regime Transition in Taiwan: A Reinterpretation of the KMT's Legitimation in the Early 1970s,Chih-Chieh Tang,"legitimacy, power, political transformation, symbolic struggle","This article challenges the popular opinion that the KMT regime solved its legitimacy crisis in the early 1970s by strengthening its coalition with local factions. Reconstructing this history from the perspective of symbolic struggle, this article points out that the crisis of external legitimacy was only a catalyst to this political transformation. It was the internal context that determined the direction of this transformation. And the fact that this transformation occurred without a mass mobilization had much to do with the historical conjunction of the power succession inside the KMT regime. But this also must be attributed to the KMT's ongoing predicament, which was grounded in its lack of sufficient power, its previous discourse of legitimation, people's definition of reality and the crisis in the moment, and dissenting voices in the public sphere. The discourse ""defending Taiwan through reform"" came out as guideline und solved the crisis successfully only because it could temporarily unite the different positions. Although this political transformation was by definition neither liberalization nor democratization, it did lead to an opening of participation in the level of central government that further engendered a nation-wide opposition. In this sense, the transformation was doubtless the starting point of Taiwan's postwar regime transformation. Based on these findings, this article highlights the advantages of an approach that grasps legitimacy/power from a symbolic dimension in comparison to one that considers legitimacy as a ""mutual recognition between power-holders."" Meanwhile, it emphasizes that future research needs to consider Taiwan's particular context seriously, to reflect upon the application of the transitological model, and to develop theory.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-12/1-4.pdf,12,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
Attitudes toward Having a Foreign Daughter-In-Law: The Importance of Social Contact,"Chin-Chun Yi, Ying-Hwa Chang","social contact, social distance, cross-border marriages, ethnic attitudes, political attitudes","This paper examines an important aspect of the emergence of cross-border marriage in Taiwan. The social distance expressed toward four major types of foreign brides--Mainland Chinese, South East Asian Chinese, Vietnamese, and other countries in South East Asia--is examined in the hypothetical context of a son marrying the specified foreign bride. Since marriage in typical Chinese culture has been an important family matter, having a foreign daughter-in-law from the parents' perspective is a culturally significant situation. The theoretical framework is derived from the classical contact hypothesis with an intention to compare the relative importance between political factors versus social contact in explaining the marital social distance revealed. Data are taken from the 2004 Social Image Telephone Survey with a random, island-wide sample of 1,217 adults. Based on Bogardus's and Allport's hypothesis, social contact is categorized into general contact and true contact. The results indicate that, consistent with previous findings, political attitudes such as political inclination and ethnic evaluation are most salient, but both types of social contact significantly reduce the social distance toward different types of foreign brides. No possible negative effect from casual contact in terms of widening social distance is found. The importance of social contact in reducing ethnic antagonism is thus supported. Furthermore, the interaction between political factors and social contact does not reach significance for all types of foreign bride, and adding the interaction effect also does not alter significant relations found with various political indicators. The paper argues that the larger political social atmosphere provides opportunities of social contact between different ethnic groups and will thus serve as an effective mechanism contributing to better ethnic relations in Taiwan.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-12/1-5.pdf,12,2006,Taiwanese Sociology
"Migration, Mental Frustration, and Modernity: The Social Origins of the Mental Disorders of the Tao Aboriginal People on Taiwan's Orchid Island",Yu-Yueh Tsai,"gene, Tao minority, migration, social suffering, mental disorder","From the perspective of social suffering, the paper explores the correlation between the migration experience of the Tao aboriginal people on Taiwan's Orchid Island and their mental disorders examines the limits of the genetic approach to aboriginal health based on the biomedical model of medicine after the 1990s. The focus of the study is on the cases of mental disorder of young and adult generations, ranging from 25- to 60-year-old population. I argue that the prevalence of mental disorders among the Taos cannot be explained by any single factor, such as a genetic disorder. My fieldwork and a variety of documentation and statistical data show that the Taos' mental health conditions are shaped by their particular historical experience of interacting with the outside world. In almost all cases, people with the experience of migrating to Taiwan and their symptoms of mental disorders began in Taiwan instead of in their isle community. I argue that the fact that the Tao members of the 25-60 age group have to migrate back and forth between Taiwan and Orchid Island to pursue education and find jobs creates a significant state of anomie in their aboriginal society, which, in turn, is a consequence of this society's involvement in the development of modernity. Migrating to Taiwan, a Han-dominated society, at the age of about 15 or 16 with little support from their families, they are prone to experiencing frustration. There is a close connection between their common frustrating experience of migration and the mental disorders prevailing among them. The physical and psychological traumas caused by the particular migration experience are not just individual experience. They represent the common dilemmas that those Tao members who receive modern education in the postwar period encounter. Under the siege of dramatic social change in the aboriginal society, they have no alternative but to leave their isle to make a living. Tao cultural traditions and their historical experience of interacting with the outside world, however, have intensified the traumas from which the migrating members suffer and contributed to the prevalence of mental disorders among them.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-13/1-1.pdf,13,2007,Taiwanese Sociology
An Unavoidable Conflict: An Explanation of the Kaohsiung Incident in Terms of the Dialectic of Structure and Process,Chih-Chieh Tang,"Kaohsiung Incident, structure/process, society/interaction, power, by self produced reality","The suppression of Formosa magazine was an unavoidable consequence, although its happening on December 10, 1979 was a contingent rather than a necessary development. Going beyond popular intentional explanations and the antimony of structure and process, this paper explains this suppression by analyzing the dialectic of structure and process with a long-term view. When in 1978 the KMT postponed the election without a definite deadline for its restoration, the opposition camp,, which had won steadily expanding support since its formation in 1975, became very frustrated and angry. Consequently, perceived the arrest of Deng-fa Yu as a signal of total suppression. For self-protection, the group adopted the ""radical"" response of demonstration, which succeeded by using the difference between interaction and society. Mass mobilization then became a possible action option and changed the structure of the political system. The KMT's inaction led to believe in its own power, and its members were attracted by the reality of nonsuppression that they themselves had produced. The conflict between the KMT and then escalated because the KMT would not agree to restore the election and willingly embraced the new arena of the streets. When the ""symbolic"" use of power could not deter and its supporters, the KMT could not help suppressing with the direct use of physical violence, in order to assure the populace to believe its power, as well as to guard the regime's stability",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-13/1-2.pdf,13,2007,Taiwanese Sociology

The thesis of this paper is fourfold. First, these immigrants' social linkages cross the Taiwan Strait, based primarily on kinship networks, were first established during the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949). Second, from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, Fujianese immigrants made their illicit entry into Taiwan possible mainly by resorting to the social rules inherent in these kinship linkages. Third, as a result of the increasingly stringent border-control policy exercised across the Taiwan Strait over the past decade, fraud marriage has become a primary means of border-crossing, thus resulting in a completely new way of understanding and practicing immigrants' social relationships in Taiwan. Lastly, in an era of globalization, the sovereign power of the nation state, as embodied chiefly in the functioning of border control, is now the primary force regulating the lives of nation/race boundary-crossers.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-13/1-3.pdf,13,2007,Taiwanese Sociology
Between the State Power and Chinese Familism: Corporate Control and Intercorporate Networks in Taiwan Revisited,Zong-Rong Lee,,"Situated within the research context of corporate control, this study investigates the extent to which the intercorporate networks of big businesses in Taiwan are influenced by state intervention and the persistent practice of Chinese familism. This study begins by developing an institutionalist approach to market governance through integrating the control imperative of state power into the framework of intercorporate network analysis, and accordingly, derives hypotheses that are tested with empirical analyses. This paper argues that corporate control is exercised through relational measures that the institutional authority seeking dominance can utilize. By tracing the strategized relations between the institutional authority and corporate actors, it is possible to comprehend how market dominance is maintained via affiliational actions in particular historical conjunctures. This paper then provides a historical survey of the investment portfolios of major, state-owned firms, identifies the underlying networking patterns, and explains three intercorporate mechanisms through which control may be exercised. Empirical analyses of intercorporate networks in 125 major state-owned and private firms during late 1990s reveal that both prominent state power and the cultural practice of Chinese familism are at work: While the particularistic guanxi networking generates a localized tendency of group formation, it is the overlapping participation of state-owned firms that eventually linked the provincial clusters of private firms together on a global level. This feature has resulted in the tendency of state-owned firms to occupy dominant network positions and engendered a network construction distinctively different from those in major industrialized economies. A dyadic statistical analysis of equity alliances among 77 major, private firms further demonstrates the structural constraints that this politicized market interface may impose upon corporate activities. Overall, analyses from this study discover empirical manifestations inimical to existing theories about Taiwan's market development. Implications for organization studies, the development state literature, and broader research contexts are discussed.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-13/1-4.pdf,13,2007,Taiwanese Sociology

In the monotheist tradition, fundamentalism is based upon interpretations of texts within the sole bible embodying revelation. In the Chinese context, because of the bifurcation between sacred books and revelation, and because the sacred books occupy a generally more approvable position than revelation, we see that the pathway of Chinese fundamentalism is through revelation to revitalize the texts' tradition, which epitomizes the morality and social order people should abide by. Finally, I offer a discussion on how the notion of ""syncretic fundamentalism"" can exist within the Chinese religious tradition, as it suggests an inherent divergence between orthodoxy scriptures and revelation.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-14/1-1.pdf,14,2007,Taiwanese Sociology
"Hourly Wages, Hard Workers, and a Hegemonic Regime: The Factory Regime of a Taiwanese-invested Factory in South China",Thomas Peng,"labor process, factory regime, peasant worker, citizenship, China","Hengfa Handbag Company, a Taiwanese-invested factory, brings an anomalistic phenomenon in the labor-intensive Pearl River Delta area: Although coercive means of labor control were enfeebled or even abolished, workers worked assiduously. Coercion based on punishment was replaced by an organization of consent, and a hegemonic factory regime rather than a despotic one now runs the shop-floor. The primary task of this study is to explain how the hegemonic regime was generated and how it obscured and secured surplus value, using Michael Burawoy's analytic concept, ""making out as a game."" In Hengfa's shop-floor, interventions by state and workers' social networks protected workers from physical and economic punishment, and in this plight for coercive labor control, a Burawoyian ""game"" was generated and replaced punishment. Output quotas were assigned every day, while only after completing the quotas could a worker leave, and the co-location of factory and dormitory, a curfew, and a desire for an urban lifestyle encouraged workers to work hard to increase their leisure time outside the factory. Furthermore, the process of pursuing this substantial reward organized the social relations among workers and produced workers' experience of the labor process to guarantee workers' voluntarily efforts to work hard. At the end of this article, these arguments bring about an attempt to identify the social context in which Hengfa was embedded: the hukou (household registration) system deeply rooted in modern Chinese society generated and legitimated the dormitory and curfew system, which in turn influenced the form of workers' activities and initiated the game on the shop-floor. The lack of citizenship reduced workers' safety and led workers to regard the dormitory and curfew system as protection rather than restraint. Through the hukou system, workers were constructed as ""non-citizen subjects,"" and through these subjects, ""state politics"" and ""production politics"" encountered each other.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-14/1-2.pdf,14,2007,Taiwanese Sociology
"Proletarianizing Urban China: The Changing Class Structure and Social Inequality, 1979-2003",Thung-Hong Lin,"social class, social stratification, China study, income distribution, economic transition","This paper adopts a neo-Marxian perspective to examine the transformation of class structure in the urban China. A class schema is developed based on the institutional features of the Maoist China: household registration (hukou) institution, work unit (danwei) institution, and cadre position, which correspond to the ownership of labor power, of organizational assets, of skills/authority in neo-Marxian class theory. In contrast, the capitalist classes are divided by authority, skill, and means of production to categorize class locations after the economic reform. The theoretical framework suggests that when hukou and danwei are undermined by the labor market and privatization, the class structure should display a trend toward proletarianization. The statistical results, based on the dataset from the 2003 China General Social Survey, showed that the main source of income inequality in urban China has shifted from differences among hukou and danwei to the differences among social classes. In addition, the income level of the self-employed is declining and its difference from the proletariat is insignificant. Analyses of a mobility table and the Multinomial Logistic Regression model confirm that the urban China has been proletarianizing over the past three decades.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-14/1-3.pdf,14,2007,Taiwanese Sociology

Because between-classroom ability grouping is not commonly practiced in Taiwan, the variability of math performance within Taiwanese classrooms is greater than that in any other TIMSS participating country. Conversely, Taiwanese fourth-graders display a very narrow dispersion in math performance, among fourth graders from 25 countries/regions, only the Netherlands has a narrower dispersion in math performance.

This article uses the production of miracles in Taiwan's folk religion as a case to undertake this discussion. A miracle involves the emergence of a particular interpretation of an event and the repression of other ones, and therefore it is about the social control of consciousness. This article considers miracles in the context of Durkheim's argument about “how god is conceived as true” and as a problem of how religion produces “misrecognition.” It then uses Bourdieu's concepts of “field,” “habitus,” and “euphemism” to discuss how this “misrecognition” is produced. The discussion proceeds within a diachronic framework by taking into account the consequences of modernity. This article also considers the issue of individuals' predicaments under the modern circumstance of pluralism.

It is an area that historians, sociologists, and political scientists in Taiwan have neglected. This paper is mainly driven by two puzzles. First, what is the KMT's attitude towards Pao-chia system, which without doubt is one of the most efficient governmental technologies in colonial history? Second, how can it be possible that the KMT as an emigree regime now enjoys such a solid power base in each and every locality in Taiwan? The argument in this paper is mainly divided into three parts. First, I introduce the Pao-chia system from the perspective of governmentality. Second, I deal with the continuity and discontinuity of the “village/li” leaders between 1945 and 1951. Third, I discuss the effect of the KMT's political rationality on the village/li. This paper concludes that the KMT did not discover the strategic importance and governmental efficiency of the village/li system until 1953. After 1953, the KMT regime gradually transformed village/li from a system of social control, as in the Japanese colonial period, to a system of election mobilization.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-15/15-2.pdf,15,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
Markets as Politics: The Formation and Transformation of the Chinese Export-led Footwear Industry,Chih-Peng Cheng,"footwear industry, Taiwanese investors, local governments, markets as politics, international division of labor","Instead of adopting approaches emphasizing “blood is thicker than water,” “strange bedfellows,” and “social embeddedness,” this paper examines the formation and transformation of the Chinese export-led footwear industry from a political perspective. In particular, a comparison between the experiences of Nike and Taiwanese footwear firms in the 1980s in China highlights how local governments, Taiwanese investors, and migrant laborers created a unique business environment. This environment not only solved uncertainties embedded in the Chinese economic transition, but also satisfied the demands of an international footwear division of labor. In addition, the paper's findings lead to a revision of Fligstein's model of markets as politics, emphasizing the central state, big firms, and local workers. Since 2000, the custom, authorized by the central government, has been attempting to grab a piece of the pie by interfering in symbiotic relationships between local governments and Taiwanese investors. The demand of “fulfilling human rights” from international buyers in Taiwanese footwear firms hides the fact that buyers should also be responsible for sweatshops. Paradoxically, the demand actually reduces laborers' interests. These struggles among new/old actors not only have made the future of the country's domination of global footwear production uncertain, but also further elaborate Fligstein's model regarding the possibilities of changing actors.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-15/15-3.pdf,15,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
"Discovering the “Developmentally Delayed”: Scientific Knowledge, Power Techniques and Social Ordering",Fan-Tzu Tseng,"medicalization, co-production, normalizing gaze, developmental surveillance, governmentality","An “Early Intervention” program was introduced formally into Taiwan in the 1990s, while making “developmentally delayed” a new category for identifying early childhood bodies to offer necessary health and education services. During less than two decades, a developmental surveillance network has been built across many different social worlds. Almost every child under age six is incorporated into this network of visibility. This research takes a co-production approach to elaborate this complex process, interweaving cognitive, cultural, social, political, and techno-scientific elements. Rather than giving causal priority to techno-science or society, I illustrate how the specific body images of early childhood and its material embodiments, and a surveillance network to collectively gaze upon children's development, have been co-produced. Besides constructing normalcy and disciplining normalization, science and technology can enlist different actors, including kindergarten and nursery school teachers, pediatricians and nurses, social workers, and parents, to engage in developmental surveillance and make sure their jobs remain coherent and consistent. However, these knowledge claims and technical objects have no inherent validity and reliability, which were at once products of social network and constitutive of forms of social life.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-15/15-4.pdf,15,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
Rethinking Movement Trajectories: Labor and Environmental Movements in Taiwan and South Korea,Hwa-Jen Liu,"movement power, movement trajectory, leverage power, ideological power","The struggles of labor movements in Taiwan and South Korea to increase their power and realize their constituents’ interests have followed a similar path over the last 30 years. Environmental movements in the two countries have also followed a similar path, but a very different one from that of labor movements. To explain why these two different national settings produce consistent differences between the trajectories and strategies of labor and environmental movements, this article develops an analytical framework that conceptualizes “movement power” as being composed of a combination of “leverage” and “ideological power.” Examining the historical sequences of movement strategies in the two countries, the analysis indicates that labor initially seeks to maximize its economic leverage and the environmental movements focus first on ideological power. After initial successes, both labor and environmental movements confront new obstacles that undermine the power they previously gained. The state and capital defame and organizationally undermine the labor movements’ support bases. At the same time, they learn to compete with the environmental movements for discursive control over ecological values. Labor strives in turn to increase its ideological power by shedding the bad name of “sectional interest” and winning the support of less-privileged workers and the general public. The environmental movements struggle to increase their leverage by building a united front with disprivileged victims of corporate environmental practices. Thus, in each case, the sequence of strategies converges around efforts to combine leverage and ideological power.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-16/16-1.pdf,16,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
Organizations’ Strategic Responses to the New Pension System: An Analysis Integrating Resource Dependence Theory and New Institutionalism,"Jyh-Jer Roger Ko, Chien-Bin Hsu","the new pension system, responsive strategy, organization theory, Resource Dependence Theory, New Institutionalism","A significant change in the labor institutionșa brand new pension systemșcame into existence in Taiwan starting July 1, 2005. The pension system changed from the old system (payment from the same employer) to a new system (individual retirement accounts). Enterprises have various strategic choices in response to the new system, and their responses are closely related to the new system’s performance. Organizations’ strategic choices have two fundamental dimensions: cost effectiveness and institutional legitimacy. The main questions raised here are: What factors affect organizations’ perceptions of cost effectiveness and institutional legitimacy regarding a specific strategic response? How do organizations compare and choose among various strategic responses? This analysis of a nationwide sample of 206 enterprises found first, that when organizations perceive more constraints from institutional pressure on their decisionmaking autonomy, they are more likely to pursue a more cost-effective and less legitimate strategy. Second, the analysis indicated that the determinants of a strategy’s cost effectiveness and institutional legitimacy are related to Resource Dependence Theory and New Institutionalism, respectively. Finally, this study found that by referring to the fundamental dimensions and combination of an organization’s strategies and by associating the choices with their respective determinants, the organization’s strategic choices can be predicted. The study concludes that only by integrating the theoretical framework of institutional isomorphism with a consideration of the actors’ activeness and self-interest can organizations’ responses to the new pension system be understood.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-16/16-2.pdf,16,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
Rethinking Nationalism through Intimate Relationships: Conflicts in Cross-Strait Marriages,Antonia Chao,"cared-for veterans, mainland spouses, intimate relationship, nationalism, social welfare","The lifting of Martial Law in 1987 opened the gate for Taiwanese mainlanders to visit family members who remained in the People’s Republic of China. During these homecoming trips, many a “cared-for veteran” married a middle-aged Chinese woman and thus eventually could develop a legal intimate relationship in Taiwan. Paradoxically, however, quite a few veteran husbands regard their mainland spouses as “Communist spies” and discipline them as such. Situated in the contemporary discursive context of Taiwanese nationalism, at the same time, mechanisms of border control, the Veteran Affairs Commission, and mass media, as well as representatives of certain political parties, often equate those mainland spouses with “life-long Red Guards”-that is, “national others by nature” within Taiwan that accordingly should be denied full citizenship rights. Based on ethnographical research of domestic violence cases occurring in the above-mentioned cross-strait marriages, this paper aims to answer the following two sets of questions: First, did life experiences during the Cultural Revolution indeed construct those mainland spouses’ national identities and everyday-life practices in Taiwan? If so, how does such a form of identity-construction progress and take effect? And, second, how and why does the veteran husband regard his mainland wife to be a “Communist spy”? In addition, how has such a (mis)understanding come into formation in the post-1949 politico-historical contexts, and, has this conception been reinforced by present conditions of social welfare, as well as individuals’ life stages?",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-16/16-3.pdf,16,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
The Use of Relics: (Trans)Formation of China’s Cultural-Relic Institutions,Ming-Chun Ku,"China, cultural governance, commodification, cultural relics","Using the concept of cultural governance, this article analyzes China’s cultural-relic institutions and discusses the use of cultural artifacts related to past-ness. It compares the aims and the relationships of the governance of cultural relics during two periods. The first period took place from the early twentieth century to the 1960s, when state ownership and Party-dominant ideology gradually institutionalized the governance of cultural relics during the formation of the socialist administrative state. The second period is the Reforms and Opening Era, when the forces of commodification influences the governance of relics, and “reforms of local cultural-relic institutions” (hereafter “reforms”) bloom in changing central/local dynamics. This article further analyzes Shaanxi’s case of “reforms” to illuminate the changing features and emerging conflicts in the transformation of how cultural relics are locally governed. Two aspects of local cultural governance in the “reforms” are the analytical foci here: aim and institutional relationship. This paper notes that “reforms” reveal the changing aim of local cultural governance towards the pursuance of the cultural economy. It also discusses the rearrangement of the institutional relationship between cultural relics and actors that serve this changing aim of cultural governance.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-16/16-4.pdf,16,2008,Taiwanese Sociology
Illness Trajectories and Invisible Work in Peritoneal Dialysis Patients' Practice,Wen-Yuan Lin,"peritoneal dialysis, patients, medical practice, trajectory, invisible work","Patients' work over the course of an illness is usually invisible to standardized medical systems. This is also the case in a project for promoting peritoneal dialysis (PD) in Taiwan. Based on insights into medical practices, this paper explores different types of PD trajectories and experiences and suggests implications for medical practices. Fieldwork, consisting of interviews with 48 patients in focus groups and 8 patients at home practice, yielded six types of PD trajectories--progress, follow, regret, victimized, active explore, and passive explore. Patients' different invisible work on emotion, sociability, and medical knowledge and techniques are also discussed. These efforts illustrate the struggles that patients coordinate through their daily lives and medical schemas. The paper concludes by explicating how the discussion of illness trajectories and invisible works contribute to medical practices, medicalsociology, and other theoretical and moral issues. The rationale is that the medical profession and policy makers should take patients' point of view into account and try to support patients with different abilities and backgrounds to do dialysis safely and flexibly rather than choose the already capable patient for the standardized dialysis.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-17/17-1.pdf,17,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
Moral Beliefs of Adolescents in Taiwan: Impacts of Social Attachment,"Ming-yeh Wu, Yuh-Huey Jou","adolescent, moral belief, social attachment, family cohesion, school attachment","This study investigates the moral beliefs of Taiwanese adolescents and examines how such beliefs may be associated with adolescent attachment to family and school. On the basis of Chinese cultural tradition, we conceptualize morality as having two dimensions-a private sphere and a public sphere-and argue that Taiwanese adolescents tend to have firmer beliefs in private-sphere morality than in public-sphere morality. The empirical data used to examine the hypotheses derive from the Taiwan Youth Project, a longitudinal survey study conducted by the Institute of Sociology, Academic Sinica. Consistent with Durkheim's social attachment theory, our findings confirm the positive impact of family attachment on both private and public spheres of morality. The findings indicate that either parent-child closeness or family cohesion is likely to strengthen adolescent moral beliefs. Hypotheses about school attachment are only partially supported, however. Attachment to school-teachers but not attachment to one's class is found to be positively associated with adolescents holding firm beliefs in morality. The study concludes with a discussion of its theoretical, methodological, and pragmatic implications as well as its limitations.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-17/17-2.pdf,17,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
"Institutional Transition and Market Networks: An Historical Investigation of Interlocking Directorates of Big Businesses in Taiwan, 1962-2003",Zong-Rong Lee,"interlocking directorates, institutional transition, market network, familism, strong ties","This study outlines the historical contours of market networks in Taiwan from an institutional perspective. By utilizing comprehensive historical data on the boards of directors for all listed private firms and stateowned enterprises from 1962 to 2003, this study investigates the extent to which macro-structural factors, such as market growth, state transformation, and cultural practices of Chinese familism, have driven the changing dynamics of interlocking directorates in Taiwan. In the early industrializing period, director networks in Taiwan resembled the corporatist structure of oligopolistic cartels, only on a smaller scale, when state enterprises played an important role and the overall integration of networks was relatively high. Although the changing route of director networks seemed to converge with patterns of advanced economies, the Taiwanese market still holds a strong local flavor in its network structure. In particular, the proportions of multiple relationships of director networks are exceptionally high and have persisted for almost half a century. The findings of this study indicate that the market network structure is the result of reinforcing influences between the legal regulation of corporate governance, which emphasizes economic security, and cultural practices of familism. After a transition period in the late-1980s, the influence of state enterprises on intercorporate networks declined enormously, mainly owing to the private sector's continuous growth and a series of deregulations of economic policies that loosened the control on private businesses' horizontal expansion. The localized clustering dynamics of familism, however, has since disintegrated the network structure, extraordinarily low centralization and a high proportion of multiple ties have become trademarks of Taiwanese corporate networks. Considering the existing legal regulation of corporate governance and the prevalence of cultural practices associated with familism, this study foresees the resilience of the Taiwanese market's current network structure.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-17/17-3.pdf,17,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
"State, Civil Society, and Deliberative Democracy: The Practices of Consensus Conferences in Taiwan",Kuo-ming Lin,"consensus conference, citizen conference, deliberative democracy, public sphere, citizen participation","The consensus conference is an innovative model of citizen participation that embodies the idea of deliberative democracy. Beginning in 2004, state-sponsored consensus conferences flourished in Taiwan. This paper analyzes the developmental trend and characteristics of Taiwan's state-sponsored consensus conferences. Adopting a political structure perspective, it investigates how the institutional configuration of state-society relations, representative institutions, and governmental decision-making structures helped shape the development and operation of consensus conferences in Taiwan. It is argued that several institutional factors combined to create favorable conditions for developing state-sponsored conferences in Taiwan. Popular discontent with the functioning of representative institutions made the appeals for deliberative democracy attractive, while the relative openness to academic consultation rendered possible the flow of consensus conferences' innovative ideas from the scholarly community to governmental officials. Facing legislative battles from opposition parties and increasing pressures of protests and participation from social groups, the minority government of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) strategically used state-sponsored consensus conferences to solve problems of governance. This paper also points out the institutional drawbacks that inhibited the sustainable development of statesponsored consensus conferences in Taiwan. Constrained by some features of state decision-making structures, the normative framework and procedural rules of consensus conferences could not be embedded in laws, institutions, and routinized practices. As a result, operational rules were not strictly followed and procedural neutrality was violated in some cases of the state-sponsored consensus conferences, which hurt the legitimacy and policy effects of this innovative model of citizen participation. The political structure perspective helps account for civic groups' attitudes toward state-sponsored consensus conferences. On the one hand, amid the popular discontents caused by adversarial politics, some civic groups attempted to promote consensus conferences to improve the quality of representative democracy, on the other hand, some social groups' undemocratic organizing and confrontational approach led certain leaders of civic groups to have little trust in government and civic competence, thus making them wary of state-sponsored consensus conferences. The ambivalent attitudes of civic society groups influenced the development and operation of consensus conferences in Taiwan.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-17/17-4.pdf,17,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
The Rise of the Peasant Rentier Class in Urbanizing China: The Transition Path and Welfare Policy of Urban Villages in Wenzhou and Wuxi,Yia-Ling Liu,"peasant rentier class, urban village, communal property rights, urban-rural welfare coverage","This article presents a rent-based class thesis to explain the emergence of urban villages and the rise of peasant rentiers during China's urbanization process. It argues that rentiers' class consciousness and interests are not only shaped by rural collective property rights, but also enhanced by household registration. This article explains the divergent paths toward urban transition and welfare coverage, as well as differences in the rentier class's collective protests in Wenzhou and Wuxi. It argues that effective supervision in local governance and frequent local-state interventions account for much of the variation in urban transition between Wenzhou and Wuxi. It also stresses that despite decollectivization central to China's market transition, the rise of urban villages and the rentier class represents re-collectivization in China's urbanization.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-18/18-2.pdf,18,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
Sub-nationalization of Social Protection: The SpatialPolitics Transformation of Social Citizenship in China,Shih-Jiunn Shi,"social security, social citizenship, spatial politics, China","The pace of welfare reform has accelerated in China since the 1990s. A closer look at current literature on Chinese social welfare reveals that it still lags far behind the progress of fast-changing welfare institutions and policies, and an adequate theoretical account to accommodate these institutional changes is still lacking. Departing from this observation, this article has two purposes: First, it identifies the limits of current literature on Chinese social welfare and social citizenship and proposes a perspective that emphasizes the spatial dimension of social citizenship to interpret ongoing welfare reforms as a result of the loosening Hukou system in China. An increasingly blurred boundary between “urban” and “rural” has given way to a new parting line, “within/without,” which demarcates the scope and extent of social citizenship within a region. In this process, local governments (especially provincial governments) have become an emerging administrative body setting the new demarcation line of social citizenship. Second, this article identifies the trend towards a subnationalization of social protection, which implies that local governments play an increasingly important role in the institutional design and innovation of social security. I use the example of local governments' pension insurance policy experiments to illustrate changes set in motion by these rising local policy innovations in terms of their influence on social policy-making at the national level. As a whole, the ongoing subnationalization of social protection is transforming the spatial politics of social welfare, which has profound implications for the development of social citizenship in contemporary China.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-18/18-3.pdf,18,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
Social Networks and Labor Market Performance: An Analysis of Taiwan Data,Ruoh-rong Yu,"social networks, weak ties, strong ties, strength of weak ties, social resources","This paper uses year 2004 survey data for Taiwan to analyze whether weak ties help job seekers attain better occupational positions and incomes than strong ties. In addition, this paper explores whether the effects vary with job seekers' socio-economic status. The findings show that, for either wage rates or socio-economic indices, the use of weak ties helps job seekers attain better job market outcomes than strong ties, which supports the “strength of weak ties” hypothesis. However, when the respondents are divided into two subgroups based on socio-economic status, the results show that the hypothesis is sustained only for the high-status sample. For the low-status sample, the strength of ties does not affect job-search outcomes. As a result of this distinctive finding, the study further examines the role of social resources in the job-search process. The results indicate that weak ties help job seekers find better jobs only when higher social resources are accessed through weak ties.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-18/18-4.pdf,18,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
Making a Living on the Move: Transnational Lives of Taiwanese Managers in the Shanghai Area,Jian-Bang Deng,"skilled workers, migration studies, Taiwanese businessmen, diaspora, transnationalism","Many highly skilled migrants do not begin a fixed or immobile livelihood after migrating to a host country. Instead, the tendency is to show a continuing and two-way movement in a transnational social space. This paper analyzes migration experiences of transnational professionals: Taiwanese managers in the Shanghai area. The theoretical background is drawn from transnationalism approaches that complement the prevailing focus on the movement of professionals, which is categorized as a ""brain drain/gain or circulation"" between sending and receiving countries, and leading to the neglect of analyzing migratory process at the micro level. Empirical data for this study are generated from a three-stage field research, in which narrative interviews were conducted with 52 Taiwanese managers and 4 of their spouses. Using typological analysis, three different migration patterns of Taiwanese managers were distinguished: 1) long-term settled 2) forreasons-of-job settled, and 3) cross-border marriage. Nevertheless, these professionals are common during the migratory process, meaning that they continually travel back and forth between societies of origin and settlement to use local material and social resources, establish transnational social networks, and span pluri-local connections, which contribute to their having stable, transnational lives. The emphasis on the transnational linkage of social practices, as well as both symbolic and material resources in migratory lives, could serve as indicators explaining why Taiwanese expatriates in the Shanghai area are neither cosmopolitan elites nor homeless diasporas, but rather, transmigrants who continually return home.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-18/18-5.pdf,18,2009,Taiwanese Sociology
Risk and Religious Development in Modern Society: The “Elective Affinity” of Religious Programming in Taiwan,Wei-hsian Chi,"religion, religious charity, risk, elective affinity, secularization","This paper explains that the religious growth and various ways of religious programming during the past decades in Taiwan are related to the production of risk discourses. Risk society provides various possibilities for religious organizations to attract participants. Many studies have argued that some other social-structural conditions can also explain the religious development, like repealing the juridical restraints on civil organizations in 1987 and the economic growth that has been occurring since 1970. Such studies do not address factors within the religious field itself. Based on the theory of risk society, I reveal the relation between the religiosity of religious organization and its religious programming, that is, the “elective affinity” of the religious organization, which shows the structural character of religious development in Taiwan.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-19/19-1-1.pdf,19,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
Sexualized Border Control: The Investigation of ‘Phony Marriages’ and the Exclusion of Chinese Migrants/Sex Workers,Mei-Hua Chen,"migrant/sex workers, sexuality, gender, phony marriage real prostitution, border control","Chinese migrants to Taiwan have been filtered out by means of two major mechanisms: interviews and investigations of ‘phony marriages.’ Based on in-depth interviews of Chinese migrant/sex workers and officers of the National Immigration Agency, I argue that these mechanisms of border control not only exclude racial and class ‘Others,’ but also sexual Others. Border control is sexualized to the extent that all Chinese migrant women are considered potential prostitutes. Only those who can pass a phony-marriage investigation are allowed to cross the border. Moreover, as it is rather difficult to differentiate a phony marriage from a real one, sexual activity usually turns out to be an important index in these investigations. It is not surprising that these investigations serve only to besiege Chinese sex workers, rather than to detect whether a cross-strait marriage in question is real or phony. On the surface, it seems that these mechanisms ensure that only genuine marriages take place. This research finds, however, that the state’s concern reaches far beyond whether a cross-strait marriage is real or phony. The underlying purpose is to gain control over Chinese migrant women’s bodies and sexuality per se. Indeed, before obtaining Taiwanese nationality, Chinese spouses who have engaged in commercial sex or any other sexual practices outside of heterosexual norms lose their spousal status and are deported back to China. I therefore argue that by examining the intersection of gender, sexuality, and ethnicity, it is possible to construct a more complex and realistic picture of Taiwan’s border control. The process of filtering out the unqualified racial and class Other simultaneously makes Chinese women’s bodies and sexuality subordinate to their Taiwanese husbands.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-19/19-1-2.pdf,19,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
"Commodification of Cultural Form, Work of “Heart,” and Economic Governance: A Case Study of the Chinese Mahogany Industry among the Austronesian Rukai, Taiwan",Weining Cheng,"cultural form, commodification, economic governance, kinship, Rukai","Drawing on the case of the Chinese mahogany industry in a Rukai community, this paper demonstrates that the commodification of cultural form involves the simultaneous, dialectical interplay between and mutual construction of economic governance, capitalist categories, and local sociocultural practices. First, mahogany farmers appropriate the imagery of a local tutelary as a registered trademark, thereby privatizing and monopolizing communally shared assets. When trademark forgery occurs, the trademark owner appeals to the township court for legal mediation, which empowers the owner to confront the socially powerful engaged in forgery, whereas the party denied access continues making forgery to resist commodification as such. Second, I divide the constitution of a cultural commodity into two parts, commodity-object and trademark with a cultural form, and then scrutinize the composition of value and the forms of value extraction involved in each, respectively. In terms of the production and consumption of a commodityobject, Rukai constructs of kinship/relatedness mediate the workings of capitalist categories, such as wage, and further facilitate a local making of commodity fetishism. In turn, kinship morality is employed to subvert the principle of equivalence in consumption to achieve de-commodification. Indeed, the Rukai imagination of a trademark as being the product of a “work of heart” is conducive to its assuming a commodity form for exchange, which implies that the owner is able to realize the monopoly rent inherent in a trademark, while disguising the owner’s extraction of others’ potential surplus value. Conversely, the party denied access highlights both multiple (ancestral and personal) efforts to manufacture the trademark and kinship morality to defy such a commodified notion. Taken together, the production of a cultural commodity is culturally mediated, experienced, and represented as hegemony, while its ideology is counteracted by an alternative imagination.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-19/19-1-3.pdf,19,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
From On War to the New History Textbook: Ressentiment and Its Institutional Constitutions in Contemporary Japanese Nationalism,Hong-luen Wang,"Postwar Japan, Allied Occupation Period, Peace Constitution, historical revisionism, multi-layered structures of Ressentiment in East Asia","Since the 1990s, there has emerged a tide of nationalism in Japan referred to as new or “neo nationalism.” Characterized by resentful feelings and negative recourses such as historical revisionism, this tide of nationalism has exposed two shortcomings of previous understandings of Japanese nationalism that need further examination. Expanding on Rogers Brubaker’s institutionalist approach, this study maintains that Japan should not be seen as a given nation-state constituted by highly homogeneous ethnicity and culture, rather, we should examine what kinds of institutions have constituted the Japanese nation since World War Two. In making this claim, this paper analyzes the causes of resentment in contemporary Japanese nationalism by investigating institutional legacies left by the U.S. authorities during the Occupation Period from 1945 to 1952. The United States left the so-called “Peace Constitution” in civic-territorial institutions, on the one hand, and the so-called “Tokyo Trial view of history” in ethnocultural institutions, on the other. These two institutional legacies planted seeds of resentment in Japanese society that, accompanied by the incompleteness and inconsistency of the Occupation reform, eventually fostered the growth of nationalism in the postwar era. In light of Max Scheler’s theory of Ressentiment, this paper then analyzes the resentment behind the discourses made by contemporary nationalists. As resentment causes value-shifts and transvaluations, these nationalists can hardly judge things in fair terms, as a result, they tend to bear distorted views of history that eventually lead to historical revisionism. The analysis also unearths the structures of feeling that can be called “multi-layered Ressentiment” in the East Asian region that deserve further examination in future studies.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-19/19-1-4.pdf,19,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
When Middle-aged Parents Meet Adolescent Children: Parent-child Relationship Patterns and Parent’s Midlife Perceptions,"Yuh-Huey Jou, Ming-yeh Wu, Lang-Wen Huang","middle-aged parents, midlife perceptions, adolescent children, latent profile analysis, parent-child relationship patterns","This research investigates the patterns of parent-child relationships between middle-aged parents and their adolescent children, and then examines their impacts on parents’ midlife perceptions with parents’ and children’s individual factors taken into account. The data used in this study are derived from Taiwan Youth Project conducted by the Institute of Sociology, Academic Sinica, Taiwan in 2000 and 2002. The analysis sample consists of 1,906 pairs of parents and children. Latent profile analysis is employed to find out the latent classes of parent-child relationships, and multiple regression is used to examine the impact of parent-child relationships on parents’ midlife perceptions. The results indicate that three factors of midlife perceptions abstracted for both male and female parents are “the parentchild gap,” “worry about the future,” and “dissatisfaction with present status.” Mother-child relationships are classified as Mother-Child Conflict, Mother-Close but Child-Conflict, Mother-Conflict and Child-Inconsistent, and Mother-Child Close. Father-child relationships are classified as Father-Child Conflict, FatherDistance but Child-Conflict, Father-Distance and Child-Close, and Father-Child Close. Both mothers’ and fathers’ midlife perceptions are affected by parent-child relationships at this developmental stage. Parents who have close relationships with their children report the least negative perceptions. For mothers, moreover, the most negative perceptions are associated with the conflict relationship among the four types. In addition, family income and health condition are significant predictors for both mothers’ and fathers’ midlife perceptions. Parents’ perceptions of the parentchild gap are connected with children’s academic performances and past parentchild relations. Finally, marital satisfaction is a significant predictor for mothers’ three factors of midlife perceptions.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-20/20-1-1.pdf,20,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
Transforming the Deployment of Patients' Agency: A Case Study of Dialysis Patients' Organizations in Taiwan,Wen-yuan Lin,"agency, deployment of agency, dialysis, patients' organization, Actor-Network theory","This paper explores the possibility of theorizing the multitude of Taiwanese dialysis patients' organizations' actions and various impacts. Drawing from the deployment perspective of Michel Foucault and ActorNetwork theory, this paper proposes the concept of ""deployment of agency"" to articulate the constitution and transformation of patients' agency in these actions. Following the deployment perspective, the organizations' ten types of action are specified as ""assistive,"" ""supplementary,"" ""transforming,"" ""antagonizing,"" and ""innovative"" strategies in terms of their relations to the dialysis regime, which (intend to) interfere with the constitution of patients' agency in terms of its subsistence, institution, identity, and knowledge aspects. This paper also argues that agency is more than a ""yes or no"" or ""enabling or not"" issue. The concept of deployment of agency proposes to portray the temporal and spatial configurations, transformation, and stabilization of agency. Apart from specifying patients' situations, this concept might be a plausible candidate for enhancing our practical and theoretical understandings of the self-transformation of social actors and the competing deployments of social regimes.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-20/20-1-2.pdf,20,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
"To Do and Not to Do Animal Release in Taiwanese Buddhism: The Intertwining of Religious Ideas, Animal Risk, and Ecological Risk",Chialuen Chen,"animal release, Buddhism, sociology of religion, environmental ethics, karma","This paper attempts to clarify the reasons why certain Taiwanese Buddhist groups do animal release, whereas others do not. Based on the actors' viewpoints, this research tries to identify the religious ideas and to categorize the ways that the evaluation of animal risk and ecological risk in the events of animal release relate to the attitudes and behaviors of Taiwanese Buddhist groups. The results show that religious thoughts not only convey the ethics of animal release, but serve as antidotes to dissolve the paradox of animal release. The practices of animal release among Taiwanese Buddhist groups are also quite diversified. The reasons and ways of both doing and not doing animal release have various patterns that imply different religious assessments. Some releasers modified the ways of animal releasing with better control of animal risk and/or ecological risk.

The Process of Technology Introduction and the Result of Development: A Comparative Study of Taiwanese and Japanese TFT-LCD Manufacturers,"Mayumi Tabata, Chih-Chia Chuang","technology introduction and learning, TFT-LCD industry, interfirm relationships, talent mobility, comparative study of Taiwan and Japan","Taiwan and Japan introduced Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) manufacturing technologies from more advanced countries. The process of technology introduction and the result of development of these two countries led to very different results, however. Japanese electronics giants introduced experimental technology from U.S. companies and developed tacit mass production technological knowledge in their R&D centers. Taiwanese Thin Film Transistor Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) manufacturers introduced tacit technological knowledge from Japan, and transformed Japanese technology into explicit and standardized technological knowledge. We conducted a comparative study of the technological development process between Taiwanese LCD manufacturers and Japanese electronics giants in terms of inter-firm relationships and cross-national talent mobility. We believe that a comparative analysis between Taiwanese TFT-LCD industry and Japanese counterparts allows us to clarify how Japanese electronics giants withdrew from the large-size TFT-LCD global market and even were forced to give up the lead to Taiwanese companies in the global market share, more specifically, the background of and reason for ""the fall of Japan, the rise of Taiwan"" in the TFT-LCD industry",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-20/20-1-4.pdf,20,2010,Taiwanese Sociology
Vanishing Farmers: Taiwan’s Early Environmental Protests Revisited,Hwa-Jen Liu,"environmental activism, resources competition, economic survival, smallholding farmers","Forms of modern, mass-based environmental activism have emerged with different sizes and shapes. On both sides of the Atlantic, environmental movements of the 1960s arose in response to environmental hazards disturbing the landscapes of affluent societies. As a late industrializer, Taiwan’s first wave of environmental actions began as an inter-sectoral struggle over the access and control of natural resources in the early 1970s. Aided by the developmental state, industrial capital seized water resources and took arable land away from smallholding farmers to build industrial parks and factories. Without proper regulations in place, unregulated liquid toxins were dumped in the surrounding irrigation systems, the emission of harmful fumes resulted in crop failure, and groundwater and fishing harbors were badly contaminated. Understandably, farmers and fishers continuously protested against such industrial practices and demanded proper compensations. Yet the intervention of intellectuals and middle classes, armed with an American-styled, class-interest-free version of environmentalism, changed the landscape of the environmental struggle. The early 1980s heralded the birth of an environmental movement wary of public health and food safety, yet devoid of genuine concerns about the economic survival of the disadvantaged. Previous struggles prompted by agricultural livelihoods had been forgotten and unequal distribution of natural resources unaddressed, and in the next ten to fifteen years, this movement bulldozed the opportunity to simultaneously pursue ecological and economic justice.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-21/21-1abs.pdf,21,2011,Taiwanese Sociology
Strangers Forever? Differential Citizenship and China’s Rural Migrant Workers,Jieh-min Wu,"differential citizenship, capitalism, class, rural-urban dualism, rural migrant workers","The paper explores the interrelationships among capitalist industrialization, domestic migration, and the inequality of citizen rights. The concept of differential citizenship (gongmin shenfen chaxu) is defined and used to explain the discriminatory treatment of rural migrant workers, especially in the sphere of social welfare. Situated within the Chinese style of capitalist development, migrant laborers suffered a double exploitation in terms of economic class relation and citizen status. The migrant working class was created by a dual process of restructuring the division of labor in world production and massive population movement in the post-Mao epoch. The disadvantaged status of migrant workers originated in the rural-urban divide and the household registration (hukou) system during Mao’s time. Rural-urban dualism, retooled during post-Mao’s “open reform,” was utilized by migrant-receiving cities to exclude the “population from outside” from enjoying urban public goods. In recent years, as social and economic inequalities became aggravated, the central government adopted new policies and demanded that local governments improve migrants’ working and living conditions, but as a consequence, a new form of urban protectionism arose in response to central reform policies, and it has further institutionalized the exploitative mechanism. This paper unravels the subtle configuration of urban protectionism by focusing on the institutionalized exclusionary devices employed on migrants. Particularly, local governments of the major East-coast cities ostensibly incorporated migrants into the urban citizenship regime, but in effect relocated them into a position of inferior citizenship, a strategy of “incorporate-to-discriminate” thus emerged. The “problem of migrant workers” leads us to the issue of transitioning to a market economy in a post-socialist nation. The author adopts a comparativehistorical perspective on modern citizenship development and points out that how the differential citizenship regime has helped forge the Chinese migrant working class.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-21/21-2abs.pdf,21,2011,Taiwanese Sociology
“Maybe I’m Not a Qualified Feminist”: Narrative Construction of Feminism Identity and Practice,Chen-Yi Yu,"narrative, feminism, identity, practice, culture frameworks","Having received feminist education in university, feminists who have become media workers tend to reveal an anxiety — “maybe I’m not a qualified feminist” — when narrating their feminist practice experience in the workplace. When these anxieties gather together, they become a public issue and attract attention to the causes of their collective apology. Using the narrative approach, the author puts these apologetic narratives into the context of the feminist community to explore how the narrative exemplars and popular plot outline of feminism culture frameworks penetrate the narrators’ life experiences, and lead them to organize and interpret life events with values, achievement, and moral responsibility embedded in the frameworks. In this case, narrators often perceive a gap between ideal models and their actions, and interpret the gap as their fault for which they should apologize. The author concludes that apologetic narratives are not only self-reflections, but also represent a deeper reproduction process of culture frameworks in which personal narratives interact with a larger cultural structure, going beyond personal troubles to public issues.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-21/21-3abs.pdf,21,2011,Taiwanese Sociology

Taiwan's Domestic Violence Prevention Law regulates the government to assign professionals to help abused victims, but the law in action shows that abused Vietnamese wives must go through multiple institutions, which put different structural constraints on them to reach the goal of escaping domestic violence.

"Between ""Homeland"" and ""Foreign Country"": Liminal Identity and Boundary Work of Taiwanese Students in China","Pei-Chia Lan, Yi-Fan Wu","student migration, boundary work, identification, national identity, Taiwan and China","Based on 61 in-depth interviews with Taiwanese students who moved to China for higher education, our study examines how migratory experience impacts the configuration and transformation of national identities. In particular, we explore how migrant students negotiate their ambiguous subject positions in webs of discourses that are interwoven between Taiwan and China, between China-as-imagined and China-inreality, and between ""homeland"" and ""foreign country."" We demonstrate how students re-identify ""us"" and ""them"" during personal encounters while living in China, and how they utilize a variety of everyday practices to highlight or downplay the boundaries between themselves and locals. We propose a map of boundary work to analyze migrants' heterogeneous positions and multifarious experiences. We identify three major types of boundary work, as follows: (1) Some students are inclined to leave China after graduation and emphasize the existence of radical differences between Chinese and Taiwanese, this strategy is most common among those who emigrated to study for degrees. (2) Some students are inclined to stay in China and become incorporated into the local society to a higher degree, such as those whose parents work in China as professionals and those who came to China for job prospects. (3) The others choose to stay in China but highlight the boundaries between themselves and locals by deploying spatial and social segregation, examples include those whose parents run businesses in China and those who seek cross-region employment and mobility.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-22/22-1abs.pdf,22,2011,Taiwanese Sociology
Coping Strategies and Institutional Divergence in the Economic Transition of Wenzhou and Wuxi,Yia-Ling Liu,"comparative institutional advantages, institutional complementary, institutional entrepreneur, institutional change of bricolage and layering","This article explores the ways in which Wenzhou and Wuxi, under the constraints of the local comparative institutional advantages and institutional complementarity, develop different coping strategies in response to intensified domestic market competition and international financial crisis in their respective paths toward market transition when China is embracing global capitalism. From an institutional perspective, this paper argues that it is the outward bridging character of business associations in Wenzhou that assume the role of a strong institutional entrepreneur to initiate institutional innovation, contributing to the local transition from the semi-laissez faire market economy to a market economy coordinated by business associations in order to prevent market failure. In contrast, it is the domination of the local state in Wuxi that ended local state corporatism over the past two decades and took the local-state-coordinated mixed-market economy at the turn of the century. The local state in Wuxi played only a weak institutional entrepreneurial role, always followed in the steps of the central state, and lacked initiative to shape its own path of transition. As a result, this article demonstrates the characteristics of bricolage and layering in the institutional change of Wenzhou and Wuxi's economic transition.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-22/22-2abs.pdf,22,2011,Taiwanese Sociology
Choreographing Risk: Multiple Sociotechnical Networks of Multiple Pregnancy,Chia-Ling Wu,"risk, gender, assisted reproductive technology, multiple embryo transfer, fetal reduction","This paper creates the concept of ""choreographing risk"" to explore the sociotechnical networks of multiple pregnancy, mostly caused by assisted reproductive technology. I argue that during the processes of assisted conception and multiple pregnancy, heterogeneous elements of technology, legality, financial issues, emotions, politics and gender are coordinated around risk. Data include in-depth interviews of women and medical professionals, as well as archival data. I find that at the stage of getting pregnant with assisted reproductive technology, doctors tend to use multiple embryo transfer and ovarian stimulation medication to increase the pregnancy rate. Both doctors and women perceive failure of conception as the major risk and tend to disregard the risk of multiple pregnancy. In the case of multifetal conception, fetal reduction becomes a technical model to reduce the risk of multiple pregnancy. Some women and doctors refuse this technique for reasons other than health risk, however, the network of fetal reduction often collapses. High prevalence of multiple pregnancy in Taiwan exists. Pregnant women of twins and triples take embodied responsibility to avoid the risk of premature birth, including diverse bodily work and negotiation between productive and reproductive labor. This paper shows that women vis-à-vis medical professionals are becoming the central choreographers in the multiple networks of multiple pregnancy. For a policy implication, I suggest adjusting assisted conception methods, such as reducing the number of multiple embryo transfers during in-vitro fertilization, to relieve women from the hard labor of multiple risk choreography.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-22/22-3abs.pdf,22,2011,Taiwanese Sociology
Flexible Specialization as a Strategy of Industrial Upgrading: The Case of the Yacht-Making Industry in Taiwan,Li-Hsuan Cheng,"Yacht Manufacturing, Industrial Upgrading, Flexible Specialization, Customized Production, Craftsmanship","Over the last two decades, yacht makers in Taiwan successfully shifted their products from small, lower-value-added yachts to mega-yachts with higher values. I argue that this case demonstrates flexible specialization, which refers to a production model that relies on high-skilled workers who can instantly respond to rapid market change. I obtained the data by collecting relevant documents and interviewing owners, managers, engineers, carpenters, and other relevant actors, which yielded the following findings. In the late 1980s when yacht makers lost the competitiveness in the market of small yachts, many chose to upgrade to the market of mega yachts. Because of the lack of market status, however, Taiwanese yacht makers must rely on customized orders for upgrading. The craftsmanship embedded in the traditional model of production buttressed the development of customized production and facilitated the long-term improvement of quality, but it also prevented yacht makers from adopting the module production system.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-22/22-4abs.pdf,22,2011,Taiwanese Sociology
"Capital, State, and Religion: The Transformation of Contemporary Chinese Popular Religion in the Perspective of ""Field""",Wei-Hua Chen,"capital, field, state, magical power, popular religion","What happened to contemporary Taiwanese popular religion as society changed? This article presents a new perspective to comprehend and depict changes in contemporary Taiwanese popular religion. Through this perspective, the changing profile of popular religion can be depicted clearly and simply, and various current descriptions of popular religion can be understood in the same framework. This article uses Bourdieu's theory of ""field"" to describe changes in popular religion and suggests that the nuclear change is the transformation of the types of capital and their deployment. There are new forms of cultural and symbolic capital emerging, thus transforming the religious field. This is the main reason why contemporary popular religion shows a new appearance. It is the force of the state, which owns the meta-capital, that comes into religious field and redefines the types of capital and the relations among them. This article provides a different view of the changing pictures of popular religion, such as ""deterritory"" and ""secularization"" through the mastery of the nature of new capitals. This article also illustrates the relationship between continuity and change in popular religion by describing its practical logic. Through Bourdieu's view of religion as an autonomous field, this article provides an alternative perspective for understanding how the state can influence religion.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-23/23-1abs.pdf,23,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
Green Energy in Action: ANT Analysis of the Innovation of the Micro Hydropower System in Taiwan,Hung-Jen Yang,"industrial local knowledge, actor-network-theory, technological innovation, latecomer technological frame, green energy","In the age of green energy, is it possible that Taiwan, as a latecomer compared with European countries, the United States, and Japan in terms of technology, can have its own unique ""green technological innovation"" instead of merely relying on ""green technology transfer""? If the answer is yes, then what are the characteristics of such innovation, specific to Taiwanese society? This paper starts with a deep description of the social history of technology, elaborating on the characteristics of technological innovation in such a latecomer society as Taiwan, by tracing and analyzing the story of a native of Yun-lin County, Taiwan, who, born shortly after World War II, is an inventor as well as an entrepreneur. The analytical frame of this paper is based on actor-network-theory (ANT), while applying and revisioning the social construction of technology (SCOT). With little formal education, but a large amount of industrial local knowledge, this greenenergy technological innovator invented ""small-scale water current turbines,"" based on traditional irrigation systems, an infrastructure constructed all over Taiwan. This innovator began his career by repairing clocks and watches, and after many years, he identified technological problems and developed technological solutions unique to a latecomer society, by constantly confronting himself with and developing his knowledge of foreign objects. Through the ""latecomer technological frame"" and ""industrial local knowledge,"" small-scale water current turbine systems have gradually formed heterogeneous associations between humans and nonhumans and have attempted to negotiate and thus stabilize the emerging network.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-23/23-2abs.pdf,23,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
Worse or Better? : Trajectories of Marital Quality and Their Mutual Influence among Taiwanese Married Couples,"Yeu-Sheng Hsieh, Yuh-Huey Jou","marital quality, change trajectory, marital couples, dyadic growth curve modeling, multilevel analysis","This paper explores couples' trajectories of marital quality and their determinants among Taiwanese families, examines the inter-relationship and mutual influence between wives and husbands' trajectories, and tests the differences in couple's trajectories among various marital-duration groups. The measurement of marital quality includes satisfaction, regret, and total quality. A total of 328 marital couples in the Taipei area having consecutive three waves of data are analyzed. Dyadic growth-curve multilevel analysis is employed to analyze the trajectory and the effect of individual time-varying and time-invariant covariates and family common variables on changes in marital quality. Marital satisfaction and total marital quality show a linear decline, but marital regret shows a linear increase in trajectories, for both wives and husbands. Changes in the trajectory of marital quality vary by their mental and physical health and perceived conflict, and they also vary by level of education, subjective economic life, living with husband's parent, and number of children in various maritalduration groups. The trajectories of marital quality differ between wives and husbands, but show a strong inter-relationship and the mutual influence of a couple. Finally, trajectories of marital quality and its relationship and the mutual influence of a couple shows an inconsistent pattern among couple groups with different marital durations. Whereas the marital quality does not significantly decline for new married couples in the first three years, the marital quality shows a significant decrease for couples with marriage durations longer than three years.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-23/23-3abs.pdf,23,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
"The Revival of Scientific Essentialism? Genetic Technology, Race/Ethnicity, and Human Classification",Yu-yueh Tsai,"race, ethnicity, genetics, identity politics, essentialism","Biomedicine's involvement in issues of human origins, racial/ethnic classification, and identity politics is new and worth studying. Focusing on increasing biomedical claims about racial/ethnic biological difference based on ""scientific evidences,"" this article emphasizes that sociologists must not limit themselves to dwelling on the social constructedness of race/ ethnicity and turn their back on the new challenge that the genetic technology of biomedicine poses. With a view to explore the social impact that the new scientific trend brings and to demonstrate how sociology can contribute to understanding this trend, the article draws on existing research literature to analyze and critique the main characteristics of the growing phenomena, as well as the knowledge presumptions and logic of practice involved in them. First, the article examines two major changes the new scientific trend has brought about: the conceptual confusion about race and ethnicity and the effects of biotechnology on the construction of national identity. It also investigates the potential negative social consequences of scientific essentialism underlying the human classification buttressed by biomedicine. Second, from the vantage point of the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK), the article exposes the knowledge presumptions, logic of practice, and epistemological and methodological limits or fallacies latent in biomedical conceptions of race and ethnicity in terms of five aspects: subjective identity vs. objective classification, statistical mean vs. absolute categorization, intra-racial/ethnic variation vs. inter-racial/ethnic variation, a single genetic attribute vs. complex social factors, and biological criteria vs. socio-cultural conventions. In conclusion, the article contends that science is not free from political, social, and cultural influences, as attested by the biomedical involvement in the contemporary identity politics of race/ ethnicity. The article also highlights the importance of a ""system of crosschecks"" proposed by Pierre Bourdieu, which can be made possible by the dialogue between sociologists and biomedical scientists, for avoiding essentializing differences among social groups and geneticizing collective identity.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-23/23-4abs.pdf,23,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
"The Medicalization of a Latecomer Society: A Critique Based on the Case of Knowledge, Profession, and Transformation of a Medical Regime in Taiwanese Chronic Kidney Disease Governance",Wen-yuan Lin,"medicalization, latecomer, professional dominance, technological governance, chronic kidney disease (CKD)","A national chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevention system was established between 2001 and 2011 in Taiwan. Instead of following the theory of medicalization developed in the context of advanced countries, this paper draws on the perspective of technological governance from science, technology, and society studies and analyzes how a medical profession ""promotes"" the disease and transforms its status and the medical regime in a latecomer country. This study criticizes medicalization theory for ignoring this latecomer context. Since the millennium, the Taiwanese nephrological profession, faced with financial and professional pressure in the dialysis regime, has promoted a ""new national disease"" discourse on the basis of international statistics and the black-boxed clinical index of eGFR. The discourse and index facilitate the implementation of a CKD regime in a project-oriented policy-making mechanism at the expense of ignoring clinical, professional, and social complexities. This regime has the following consequences: It reverses the status of the nephrological profession but causes internal diversification, it worsens the imbalance between hospitals and local clinics, and its insufficient understanding of and support to diagnosed patients might cause iatrogenesis. In conclusion, this study specifies the ""self-latecomerization"" characteristics of the profession, knowledge, and policy-making mechanisms of latecomer medicalization.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-24/24-01abs.pdf,24,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
Anything but Online? The Digital Divide and Social Consequences of Internet Use in Taiwan,Thung-hong Lin,"Internet, digital divide, social network, income inequality, social movement","The article examines the relationship between Internet use and social networks as well as social inequality in Taiwan. I divide the literature into three approaches: Cyber-utopian, Cyber-dystopian (control theory), and skeptical (social-shaping aspect) and illustrate their different hypotheses regarding social inequality, social networks, political behavior, and collective action. The Cyber-utopian approach claims that the diffusion of Internet use reduces information cost, equalizes market opportunity, and increases social capital, but the Cyber-dystopian approach claims that Internet use empowered ordinary political and economic elites. Both approaches focus on the social impacts of Internet use and imply technological determinism, while the skeptical approach focuses on the social inequality of Internet use, especially on the digital divide. According to a national survey (TSCS) conducted in Taiwan during the 2000-2010 period, I investigate hypotheses derived from the three approaches. The empirical findings confirm that inequalities still created digital divides of Internet use, but the effect of average time online per day is insignificant or ambiguous on the size of social network, income distribution, voting behavior, and participation in social movements. In sum, most empirical results support the skeptical approach rather than the two forms of technological determinism.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-24/24-02abs.pdf,24,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
Helping Professions and Multidimensional Emotional Labor: A Comparative Analysis of Foreign Spouse Services between Social Workers and Lay Helpers in Taiwan,Ke-hsien Huang,"social worker, emotional labor, helping professions, foreign spouses in Taiwan, case management","Although many investigations on various occupations have been conducted to address the concept of emotional labor, the emphasis has been placed on simple emotional labor practiced by employees exploited under capitalist firms' surveillance and discipline. Little has been done to explain the multidimensional complexity of emotional labor manifested in the helping professions, which must maintain long-term, close relationships with clients, involves subtle emotional management, and has emancipationfacilitating implications. This comparative analysis between social workers and lay helpers in Taiwan aims to fill this empirical gap. Meanwhile, it suggests that the entire professional system orchestrates different tools— including collective-ritual-like seminars, professional knowledge, the institution of supervision, and tempo-spatial segmentation—to facilitate the multidimensional emotional labor. The results show that social workers delivering services to the stigmatized clients of foreign spouses engage in three distinct types of emotional labor: First, social workers must show positive emotions ingenuously, then maintain detached, free-emotion selves for objective judgments, and finally display unpleasant emotions to empower clients. In reality, however, the emancipatory promise of the profession is compromised as follows. Social workers are observed to reracialize foreign spouses and enact a welfare system that prejudices against lower classes, the professional language seems alienating to front-line practitioners, and finally, in the process of privatizing welfare services, social workers are likely to reduce the amount of services in the name of empowerment. Paradoxically, these exhausted professionals turn to lay helpers for ingenuously caring for clients, a group over which the professional system has little control and that seems unable to perform the required emotional labor.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-24/24-03abs.pdf,24,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
The Development and Influence of Theravada Buddhism in Taiwan: A Globalization Perspective,Chialuen Chen,"globalization, Taiwanese Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, Original Buddhism, Vipassana","Globalization has been a visible factor in Taiwan's religious changes. There is little research, however, on the relationship between globalization and the changes of Taiwanese Buddhism. Based on the globalization perspective, this paper investigates Theravada Buddhism, including its introduction, its development in Taiwan, and its influence on Taiwanese Buddhism. This paper proposes an analytical framework and identifies four types of groups that are related to Theravada Buddhism: Theravada Buddhist centers in Taiwan, the Insight Meditation Movement, the Original Buddhist Movement, and some Chinese Buddhist groups that have adopted Theravada Buddhism selectively. Among these groups, there are variations in routes of introduction, ways of practice, positions of Buddhist identity, characteristics of participants, and types of movements. The diversities among these groups demonstrate the multiplicity and complexity of the development of Theravada Buddhism in Taiwan. This paper finds that the import of Theravada Buddhism initiated by the needs of Taiwanese elites weighs more heavily than that introduced by Southeast Asian immigrants, foreign workers or missionaries of Theravada Buddhism. Further, the selected or transformed Theravada Buddhism is more popular than the original or full-scale Theravada Buddhism. I also find that most foreign Theravada Buddhist monks have adjusted their ways of everyday life and dharma preaching in Taiwan. In sum, the influence of Theravada Buddhism on Taiwanese Buddhism is multifaceted, increasing the pluralism and competition among Buddhist groups, offering more alternatives of Buddhist identities and selection, stimulating the innovation of Chinese Buddhism in Taiwan, and enhancing the globality of Taiwanese Buddhism.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-24/24-04abs.pdf,24,2012,Taiwanese Sociology
Sociological Enlightenment of Art: Bodily Technique as the Constructive Foundation of Social Aesthetics ,Wei-hsian Chi,"art, public art, social aesthetics, bodily technique, festival ","A new genre of public art started appearing in western modern countries in the 1990s. This forced modern art to face a new issue: artistic publicity. Public art is more than a new form of art, and it leads us to see that there is a specific reciprocal relation between aesthetic practices and political as well as religious discourses. By examining the semantic lineage of ""art"" in western modern societies, this paper shows how modern societies understand ""art"" and construct artistic publicity. In addition, this paper takes Taiwan society as an example for showing that there is still another kind of aesthetic practice in modern society. They are various forms of cultural festivals that are run in a different way than professional art, but both have the same constructive function in social aesthetics. This theoretical discourse contributes to the viewpoint that bodily technique shall be seen as the basic operative medium of social aesthetics.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-25/25-01abs.pdf,25,2013,Taiwanese Sociology

The analysis is based on an artifact-centered perspective, in which the governmentality and political effects of vaccines are considered in the history of immunization in Taiwan. The article argues that the governmentality of vaccines results from the acceptance of imported technologies in a domestic regime of truth in accordance with local networks of truth-telling. Domestic implications of the technology further enforce or reshape the network for the acceptance of new vaccines, thus showing the effect of path-dependence. A governmentality crisis is envisaged for the early 21th century, however, because of disintegrated discourses, decentralized strategies, and dispersed governance of emerging high-valued vaccines.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-25/25-02abs.pdf,25,2013,Taiwanese Sociology
"Causes and Consequences of High School Curriculum-Track Selection: Gender, Belief, Teacher's Gender, and Cognitive Development ",Wan-chi Chen,"high school curriculum track, cognitive development, gender stereotype, teacher gender, sex segregation ","Among high-school students in Taiwan, the majority of those enrolling in the math- and natural-science-oriented curriculum track are boys. In contrast, girls are crowded in humanity-oriented programs, where mathematics courses are less rigorous. The persistent gender imbalance in high school programs did not receive adequate attention, however. Analyzing the core panel from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS), this study investigates the causes and consequences of curriculum-track selection for high school students. There are four major findings. First, there was a significant positive effect of choosing ""natural science program"" on basic achievement tests, controlling for previous test scores. The size of this ""natural science program effect"" was about the same for both genders. Second, this ""natural science program effect"" explained boys' more rapid cognitive development, compared with girls. Third, about one third of high-school students believed the statement that ""it would be better fit if boys choose to study natural science rather than girls."" Fourth, among 9th graders who believed the above statement, boys were more likely to choose ""natural science program"" later at the senior-high-school stage and, in contrast, girls tended to choose the ""social science program,"" controlling for previous test scores. Fifth, teacher's gender had an impact on student's choice. When girls had ever been taught by a female math teacher during junior high school, they were more likely to select the ""natural science program."" In contrast, when math teachers were predominantly male, boys were less likely to choose ""social science program."" The results suggest that the dual-track curriculum system in Taiwan's high schools may exploit students' opportunity for enhancing important problem-solving skills. In contexts where such belief (""natural science is a male domain"") is prevalent, female students' development could be severely suppressed.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-25/25-03abs.pdf,25,2013,Taiwanese Sociology
The Influence of Structural Stability on Dynamic New Tie Formation: A Local-Based Network Analytic Approach,"Kuen-Shiou Yang, Chyi-In Wu, Yi-Long Jaw","structural balance, structural imbalance, dynamic new tie for-mation, structural stability ","In this study, we adopt a structural balance perspective to examine how the extent of structural stability influences a dynamic new tie formation based on a local-based network analytic approach. By comparing structures of alliance (economic relation) and friendship (social relation), this study yields two major findings. First, under the agreed-upon potential-structural-balance situation, a partner's partner (i.e., economic relation) and a friend's friend (i.e., social relation) have a higher probability of being new mutual partners and friends in the future than a partner's partner and a friend's friend in unbalanced situations. Second, under the conflicting potential-structural-balance situation, a competitor's competitor (economic relation) could be a new partner in the future. The possibility of being a new future partner in this situation, however, is not significantly higher than such a possibility in an unbalanced situation. In contrast, under the conflicting potential-structural-balance situation, an enemy's enemy (social relation) probably would not be a new friend in the future and there is no significant difference, in terms of possibility, between conflicting potential-structural-balanced and unbalanced situations. Last but not least, for comparing the difference between agreed-upon and conflicting potential-structural-balance cases, the possibility of a dynamic alliance formation in the agreed-upon potential-structure-balance situation is higher than that in a conflicting one, while the possibility of a difference between agreed-upon and conflicting situations for dynamic friendship formation is not found at all.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-25/25-04abs.pdf,25,2013,Taiwanese Sociology
"Genetic Science and Identity Politics: Indigenous DNA, the Origin of the Taiwanese, and the Emergence of Bio-multiculturalism",Yu-yueh Tsai,"genetic origin, identity politics, indigenous blood, biomedicalization, co-production","In the global age, the close connection of genetic knowledge and technology with local identity politics has stimulated the development of a “biopolitical paradigm.” In Taiwan, the biopolitical paradigm shaped by the intimate relationship between the development of biomedicine and identity politics has involved not only racial/ethnic issues but also national identity. Scientific research regarding the ancestral origins and genetic attributes of the Taiwanese emerged in the early 1990s after the rule by martial law ended. This research has focused on mixed-blood hybridity of the Taiwanese and the percentage of indigenous blood in their genes. This research interest represents a common feature of global identity politics since the late twentieth century: a counter-discourse shaped by decolonialism. Based on Sheila Jasanoff’s idea of “co-production,” this article explores the “inward invasion” of social factors into the production of scientific knowledge and the “outward spillover” of scientific knowledge to the society. It analyzes how the production and consumption of scientific knowledge about the ancestral origins and genetic attributes of the Taiwanese have been embedded in local identity politics, including the emergence of the “four great ethnic groups” categorization, multiculturalism, and Taiwanese nationalism, and shaped by the identity and difference based on specific human classification. The article also examines how the scientific knowledge produced in the lab has spilled over to the Taiwanese society in general through conferences, journals, media, and the like since the 1990s and brought about significant social impacts as part of the phenomena of the “ethnicization of biomedicine” and the “biomedicalization of ethnicity.” Taking the perspective of “reflexive biosociality,” the article concludes with the suggestion that it is necessary for sociologists to investigate the contemporary production of biomedicalized knowledge about identity and that scientists themselves should take a reflexive view of this production methodologically.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-28/28-01abs.pdf,28,2014,Taiwanese Sociology
Flexible Patienthood: Care Trajectory in Family Living with Dementia,Chen-shuo Hong,"dementia, care, uncertainty, trajectory","This study explores the effects of dementia on its care trajectory in the family setting. Based on in-depth interviews of family caregivers, naturalistic observations, and archival data, the present study examines uncertainty in medical care and how people with dementia and their family caregivers deal with it. This study finds that patients and caregivers tend to adopt various strategies to deal with the contingencies incurred by dementia and negotiate between the patient’s multiple identities at different stages of care trajectories. I refer to this dynamic process of on-going negotiation as “flexible patienthood,” which provides a unique lens for analyzing the handling of contingency with regards to work arrangements and identity shifts. Flexible patienthood is constrained by social structures, such as the drug reimbursement system, socially assigned roles, and the stigmatization of dementia. In contrast to previous studies, which regard people with dementia and their family caregivers as “victims of dementia,” this study highlights their proactive participation and challenges the infantilization of people with dementia.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-28/28-02abs.pdf,28,2014,Taiwanese Sociology
The Mediation and Intervention of the Cultural Intermediaries: The Contradiction in the Creativity Production of the Publishing Industry,Ling-Yee Lee,"publishing industry, creative industry, cultural intermediaries, uncertainty","Cultural intermediaries are cultural workers mediating cultural production and consuming public. This article explores the multiplicity of practices of the cultural intermediaries in publishing industry in Taiwan. As gatekeepers in the publishing field, publishers and editors have antagonistic cooperation with authors, as mediators between creativity production and book market, they have to make trade-off between cultural value and market profit. Based on field work and interviews, the paper investigated the roles of cultural intermediaries in creation and reproduction stages of book production, and constructed a typology of editors in Taiwan. I found that the role model of the editors has been transforming from “gatekeeper model” selecting and filtering creative works to the “producer model” involving and intervening in the creative stage. There contains a contradiction in the latter model as the intermediaries substituted authors and became creative subjects.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-28/28-03abs.pdf,28,2014,Taiwanese Sociology
"Hollowing Out or Sustaining? Taiwan’s SME 文 Network-based Production System Reconsidered, 1996-2011",Michelle Fei-yu Hsieh,"SME network production, decentralized industrial structure, flexible specialization, innovation, industrial transformation","The dominant view of Taiwan’s industrial transformation suggests scaling up and growing concentration as the strategies for surviving global competition, thus implying the demise of the SME system. Through a detailed sectoral analysis of Taiwan’s manufacturing industries during the 1996-2011 period, using industrial and commerce census data, this article examines two competing questions (1) whether a SME network-based production system is still viable in Taiwan, and (2) whether Taiwan’s industrial structure is headed towards the modern industrial capitalism associated with increasing concentration and dominance by large corporations. The detailed breakdown by sectoral analysis suggests the following. (1) The Information Technology (IT) sector may have skewed our understanding of the overall performance of Taiwan’s manufacturing sector. The growth-driven approach, which centers on the performance of individual firms making the final product, has overlooked the value-added by independent parts makers. (2) The contribution of the machinery and metal sector (mostly SMEs) to Taiwan’s economy, measured by valueadded, is similar to that of the IT sector (with the exception of the semiconductor industry) on which current generalizations on the rise of large firms draw. (3) Lastly, contrary to the claim of the hollowing out of SMEs with the rise of the IT sector and that Chandlerian modern large corporations prevail, the findings reveal that the decentralized production system in which a system of SMEs and the networks among them for coordinating economic activities continues to thrive. The article then discusses the mechanisms that drive the SME system, namely, the overlooked role of parts makers and their cross-sectoral, skills based learning, and the role of para-public institutions in coordinating a decentralized industrial system. It concludes with a reconceptualization of the paths to prosperity and policy implications.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-28/28-04abs.pdf,28,2014,Taiwanese Sociology
Institutionalizing White-Terror Traumatic Memories in Taiwan: An Historical Institutionalism Perspective,Hung-ling Yeh,"collective memory, white terror, National Human Rights Museum, path dependence, historical institutionalism","According to declassified archives and recent research, most of the political persecution during the decades of Martial Law accounts for cases related to clandestine organization of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), rather than the “ones involving unjust, false and wrong charges.” This has been challenging a common belief among critics of the KMT government to weaken the legitimacy of the authoritarian regime for a long time. Why had not the National Human Rights Museum (NHRM) under the KMTruling government become the field of struggle of ideology and national identity? In this study, the perspective of historical institutionalism, particularly the concept of path dependence, is used to explain the institutionalization of the white-terror traumatic memory in Taiwan to answer the above questions. This article not only provides a pilot study of NHRM, but also helps to fill the gap of previous traumatic memory studies, which have largely relied on narrative or text analysis. I suggest that the organizational logic and production of the narrative of the museum are embedded within modern political circumstances. Any attempt to explain the narrative variations of the NHRM must take into account the issue of institution and bureaucracy. While tracing back to how the DPP-ruling government created the Human Rights Park (the predecessor of the NHRM) under the wave of privatization, I show how the policy choice in the 2000s restricted the subsequent process of the NHRM's establishment. The policy network shaped within the institution enables the private sector to participate in the narrative construction of NHRM. As a result, the mainstream view of their assertion of “unjust cases” assimilates the various types of memory.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-29/29-01abs.pdf,29,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
Institutional Analysis of Training at Hi-Tech Manufacturing Firms in Taiwan,"Li-hui Peng, Ray-May Hsung","organizational study, institutional analysis, global commodity chain, latecomer learning, training","Numerous studies have categorized Taiwan as a “learning latecomer.” Through Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM), Taiwan started to join the global commodity and supply chains in the 1980s and attained semiperipheral positions in the global division of production. Previous studies, however, have determined little regarding how technologyreceiving countries, such as Taiwan, transfer technology and skills to the workers of local firms through the firms’ training systems fostered by global customers. Because few studies have examined this topic, this study explored an indigenous analytical framework regarding the institutional characteristics of job training for OEM and Original-Design-Manufacturer (ODM) firms rather than testing the theoretical hypotheses of general theories on job training in foreign countries or the predominant theory from the efficiency viewpoint of economics-based rational interpretations. To further explore how manufacturing companies train their staff members and employees, this study collected data from in-depth interviews. On the basis of interviews with human resource managers at 41 companies (officers as well as leaders of human resource associations and training institutes), the study selected a survey sample of 72 interviewees. This research put the main theoretical emphasis on the forces of global production networks, and Taiwanese firms located in different positions of production technological chains develop different logics of action practices to deal with the demands of global customers and the characteristics of organizational fields. OEM and ODM firms have developed two training institutions: a latecomer’s learning of following and a latecomer’s learning of innovative catch-up. This dual institutional logic regarding training might help explain Taiwan manufacturers’ experiences.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-29/29-02abs.pdf,29,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
From Unification-Independence Divide to the China Factor: How Changing Political Identity Influences Voting Behavior,"Jieh-min Wu, Mei Liao","China Factor, 1992 Consensus, trade dependence, voting behavior, national identity","The “China factor” has increasingly penetrated Taiwan’s electoral politics and is complicating the role that “national identity cleavage” has conventionally played in Taiwan. The China factor may have also caused a change in Taiwan’s “unification-independence cognitive map” through its influence on politics, economy, news media and cultural sphere. Using the survey data collected by the China Impact Studies Group of the Academia Sinica, this paper found that in the presidential election in 2012, the “China factor” variables are likely replacing the function of “national identity” variables in a variety of contexts. We attempt to provide a preliminary analytical framework to explore the significance of the findings and attempt to substantiate the proposition that trade and economic dependence is the key factor in a regional power’s ability to influence the domestic politics of a small country. We found that the Chinese government indeed leveraged Taiwan’s trade and economic dependence to intervene in Taiwanese elections, and the China factor has indirectly led to a number of subtle effects on Taiwanese voters’ cognition of national identity. In addition, there has emerged a new class politics in Taiwan in recent years. However, we found that “class voting” is not significant. This finding differs from other findings in the current literature on class politics and deserves further exploration.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-29/29-03abs.pdf,29,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
A Discourse Beyond “Wife Batterers:” An Institutional Ethnographic Analysis of Men in the Batterer Prevention Program,"Wen-hui Anna Tang, Pei-Ru Liao","Institutional Ethnography, lived experiences, disjunctures, ruling relations, ideological practices","This paper analyzes wife batterers through the lens of Institutional Ethnography. Using field observations in focus groups and in-depth interviews, the researchers investigate the institutional realities constructed by the Domestic Violence Prevention Program and the ruling relations surrounding the professionals and wife batterers. The narratives of these wife batterers reveal that there are experiences of disjunctures between the lived experiences of wife batterers’ marriages and the professionals within institutional realities. From these wife batterers’ experiences of disjunctures, this paper demonstrates four perspectives within the institutional discourse of the Domestic Violence Prevention Program: (1) the institutional discourse of social work focuses on protecting the battered women, (2) the institutional discourse of the legal system emphasizes punishing violence, (3) the institutional discourse of the medical system targets behavioral corrections, and (4) the institutional discourse of feminism sees battering as a gender-based problem. Initiated by the feminist agenda, the process of the institutionalization of domestic violence prevention takes place with assistance from the legal system, the medical system, and social workers. These institutional discourses reveal that professionals tend to view those men with conservative gender values as finding excuses for violent behaviors. The findings of this study indicate that the current Program fails to deconstruct the connections between violence and masculinity, because violence and a certain type of masculinity are products of patriarchy. This paper shows that the ideological practices of “protecting women” might simply label men as abusers, but fail to build trust between men and the professionals. To conclude, the researchers argue that it is important to consider masculinity, class, and violence from a gendered perspective when designing the Batterer Prevention Program to lower the recidivism rate.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-29/29-04abs.pdf,29,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
Popular Protest in an Authoritarian Regime: A Wildcat Strike in Southern China,Chih-Jou Jay Chen,"protest, protest mobilization, authoritarian regime, China","Based on a case study of a workers’ wildcat strike in a Taiwanese footwear factory in Guangdong, this study examines the protest mobilization and government response in the Chinese authoritarian regime. The findings indicate that the massive 10-day strike involved a series of mechanisms, including: (1) the unique ecology of the factory campus that nurtured close-knit worker networks, (2) workers’ spontaneous mobilization that lacked both central leadership and autonomous organizations, (3) advice and instruction from independent labor NGO activists, (4) appeals to citizenship rights and legalism, and (5) mobilization though emotions, ideological symbols, and rumors. The company and local government had different interests and incentives, and thus could not collude on curbing the strike. The local state, despite not being able to prevent a strike from happening, is able to contain a massive strike, relying on its police, official trade unions, and Party system. Nevertheless, collective action by disadvantaged groups pressured the local government’s implementation of laws and policies from above. Thus, mass protest played a crucial role in the dynamic political process, exemplifying the changing nature of state-society relations in China.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-30/30-01abs.pdf,30,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
"Segmented yet Entangled, Interdependent Faith Revivals: Rural Migrants’ Lived Religion in Urban Chinese Churches",Ke-Hsien Huang,"Christianity in contemporary China, Status hierarchy, education, rural migrants, peasant workers","This paper investigates the relationship between transforming Protestantism and urbanization in contemporary China by examining how rural migrants are incorporated into urban churches, education as an achieved status is demonstrated to play a role in this incorporative process. Through data collected from participant observation and in-depth interviews, I argue that the massive inflow of rural migrants, who consist of two growps— “uncultured” peasant workers and highly educat ed migrants — are regaining faith in through differenet trazectories. Fearing the untruthful, morally questionable urban environment, peasant workers, who are stigmatized as uncultured and having no Suzhi (素質), consider the church a home-like space characterized by unconventional love, equal relationships, and voluntary participation. In contrast, highly educated migrants, who have experienced the spirit of the entrepreneurial self, regard the church as an experimental ground to realize new religious practices that are based on individual expertise and personal experiences, by doing so, they make distinction against the old rural mode of faith. I further demonstrate how the incorporative processes of these two status groups into urban churches are segmented yet entangled: To legitimatize and realize their leadership and discursive power in urban churches, highly educated migrants need peasant counterparts to provide the labor force and to be pedagogical objects. Moreover, migrant-worker merchants illustrate the possibility of occupational experiences translated and converted into religious capital, which helps with the upward mobility within the religious hierarchy, nevertheless, occupation, as opposed to education, usually brings with it moral questionability and profanity. In sum, despite peasant workers’ possible access to urban supportive networks in churches, they experience a process of exclusion via inclusion.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-30/30-02abs.pdf,30,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
The Production and Use of Social Capital Embedded in the Gender Code System: Two Cases of Women’s Community Participation in Taiwan,Su-chiu Chen,"gendering social capital, community participation, bonding social capital, bridging social capital","Since Robert Putnam began researching the relationship between social capital and civic engagement, critics have frequently argued for the need to focus on hidden gender issues. The current study aims to reveal the gendered implications of social capital in the context of community development in Taiwan and argues that the gendering of social capital in the community is embedded in two central aspects. First, bonding social capital, which is largely maintained by local women, serves as an important foundation in initiating the process of community development. Furthermore, the bonding social capital produced by local women reinforces the reproduction of outward social networks for leaders of the community in terms of their connections with local governments and other communities, otherwise known as bridging social capital. The contributions made by bonding social capital maintained by women, however, have rarely been recognized in Putnam-inspired social capital studies. Second, while women volunteers' networks can help spur vibrant community building, the gender-coded system practiced in daily community life often drives community members to interpret men’s presence or absence in a manner that solidifies gender separation, thus leading to the interpretative feminization of local community participatory networks. Such interpretative feminization of community networks frequently limits women to viewing their own community networks and participation as contributing solely to personal social life and mental health, rarely empowering them to consider their participatory network as potentially significant to addressing and challenging governmental policy and resource structures.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-30/30-03abs.pdf,30,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
Outcry Outside the Legislature: A Portrait of Sunflower Movement Sit-In Demonstrators,"Wan-Chi Chen, Su-Jen Huang","Sunflower Movement, protest survey method, social movement","The Sunflower student movement, which occurred in the spring of 2014 in Taiwan, has shaken the political kaleidoscope of Taiwan as well as the whole of society. During the second week of the Sunflower Movement, volunteer faculty and students from National Taipei University, Department of Sociology executed a survey among the sit-in demonstrators outside the Legislature, relying on a systematic sampling procedure and short face-toface interviews by trained interviewers. Whereas public opinion split along the political divide, many believed that most protesters were students who were either ideologically radical or driven by a political party. This study, however, provides a more complete portrait of the protesters, which contradicts popular belief. Our study reached the following conclusions. First, except for the fact the most participants are rather young (3 out of 4 are less than 30), their fields of study (among students) and occupations (among non-students) are very diverse. Second, although it is widely believed that the Internet plays an important role in this collective action, very few participants reported that they were recruited by virtual rallies. Nearly half of the protesters reported that they joined the sit-in spontaneously. Third, for these protesters, social media was the most important information source during the protest. 9 out of 10 listed Facebook (or other types of social media) as being among their top three information sources",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-30/30-04abs.pdf,30,2015,Taiwanese Sociology
From “Handicapped” to “Disabled” : A Content Analysis of Disability Labels and Discourse in Taiwanese Newspapers,"Heng-hao Chang, Jing-yi Wang","charity, content analysis, disability, labeling, stigma","Combating disability stigma and labels has been the political agenda of the disability rights movement. This research uses content analysis to explore the impact of renaming the disabled from “cán jhang” (殘障 the handicapped) to “sh n x n zhàng ài” (身心障礙 people with physical and mental disabilities) and the transformation of disability in Taiwanese public discourse from 1953 to 2014. We examine the images of disabled people, the model of the newspaper narrative, and the typology of newspaper content with different disabled labels and historical periods. We use systematic sampling to collect data come from the United Newspaper data base from 1953 to 2014. The results show that the change of the disability label by law did not change the model of the newspaper narrative but partly transformed the images and content of disability newspaper reports. There are more images of care burdens and more newspaper coverage on care issues under the label “cán jhang.” Comparing disability in different historical periods, there is no significant difference in the model of newspaper narrative, but there are many more images of helpless disabled people. In addition, there are significantly more disability charity events mentioned in newspapers after 2008. Finally, we discuss the content of the charity events, where disabled people are always the subject of being helped and their voices are usually unheard. We argue that the relabeling of disability in Taiwan was advocated and promoted mainly by scholars and politicians and lacked social movement mobilization and social consensus. In addition, under public-owned and private-managed social policies, the number of service-oriented non-profit organizations has increased significantly, and these organizations compete for resources. Thus, news discourses of the charity model increased after 2008.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-31/31-01abs.pdf,31,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
"Who Will Be Willing to Deliberate? Civic Talk, Social Capital and Deliberative Democracy in Taiwan",Kuo-ming Lin,"deliberative democracy, civic talk, social capital, political participation, political discussion","Civic talk, social capital, and the practice of deliberative democracy, are said to be good for shaping active, democratic citizenship, but the relationships among the three have not been theoretically and empirically explored. This paper examines their relationships and the implications for inequality in citizen participation. Using data from a national survey conducted in Taiwan, this paper explores citizens’ support for and willingness to participate in governmentorganized deliberation. I found that 73% of respondents agreed with the idea that governments should convene citizen deliberation before making decisions on important issues, and 53% said that they would be willing to participate in such events. What accounts for the public willingness to deliberate? The results of statistical analysis show that : (1) Civic talk, defined as engagement in conversations about social events in informal settings, influenced the willingness to deliberate through the mediating effects of civic mindedness and skills (including political efficacy, political interest, political knowledge and communicative ability), (2) The number of those joining various types of voluntary associations also affects the willingness to deliberate, largely by producing mobilization effects on civic talk, and (3) Women and the less-educated are less willing to participate because of the mediating effects of gender and educational inequality in civic mindedness and skills. This paper thus found that civic talk and social capital can help construct a civic-culture foundation for deliberation, but inequality persists and needs to be overcome in the practice of deliberative democracy proclaimed to fulfill the ideal of political equality.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-31/31-02abs.pdf,31,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
Corporate Power and Democracy: An Analysis of Business Groups’ Campaign Contribution in the 2008 Legislator Election,Zong-Rong Lee,"campaign contribution, business group, family business","Political sociologists have long been analyzing political donation data of businesses to evaluate the extent to which corporate power intervenes in political processes. In this paper, the campaign contribution data of business groups in the 2008 legislator election is collected and examined with three major theoretical viewpoints: the material interest, class hegemony, and the inner circle theories. Empirical evidence shows that business groups that are larger in size, of family-owned, and feature controlling families with higher in social status are more likely to contribute to legislator candidates. Moreover, business groups operating in the information technology industry are less likely to contribute. These results indicate that large domestic-oriented and family-owned business groups are the key donors to political campaigns, wich reflects the unique political-economic nature of contemporary Taiwan.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-31/31-03abs.pdf,31,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
Chinese Capitalism from Outside: A Case Study of the Emergence of Private Enterprises in the Pearl River Delta,Chih-peng Cheng,"Chinese capitalism, nascent entrepreneurs, private enterprises, post-socialist economic transition, Taiwanese investors","This paper explores the start-up process of Chinese private manufacturing firms in the Pearl River Delta during the post-global recession. Previous studies on the emergence of private enterprises in China have emphasized the perspective of “capitalism from below,” arguing that entrepreneurs devised institutional innovations through trial and error that enabled them to decouple from the established, unfavorable economic order. These informal institutional arrangements in the Yangzi River Delta not only resolved the free-rider problem, but also developed competitive advantages in self-organized industrial clusters. The perspective of “capitalism from below,” however, overlooked the local institutional divergence in studying Chinese economic transition. Since local manufacturing firms in the Pearl River Delta are embedded in an organizational field controlled by transnational enterprises, Taiwanese investors in particular, these nascent private entrepreneurs may acquire capital, techniques, human resources, and management skills from transnational capitalists other than local social networks. In other words, China’s capitalist economic institutions and business norms are forms of “capitalism from outside.” This case study is intended not only to enhance our understanding of late-comers on the emergence of capitalism, but also to contribute to the dialogue with Chinese state capitalism at this stage.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-31/31-04abs.pdf,31,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
When the Women’s Movement Confronts the State: Multiple Strategies for Promoting Gender,"Shu-ling Hwang, Wei-ting Wu","Gender Equality Committee, state feminism, social movement, social capital, women’s movement","Gender mainstreaming by the Taiwanese government began in 2005 under the Executive Yuan, with work spearheaded by the Committee of Women’s Rights Promotion (CWRP) during its 5th and 6th terms (2005-2009). This paper examines the alliance strategies that women’s activists in the CWRP adopted to promote gender mainstreaming within the state during that period. By exploiting changes in the political opportunity structures, creating social capital, and exercising emotion work, these activists, a group empowered by strong mutual trust and a high level of selfdiscipline, were able to bring about concrete institutional changes. They successfully built the CWRP into a habitat for women’s movements, reaching out to other feminist networks both inside and outside the state to create solid bonding social capital. At the same time, taking advantage of the shifting political opportunity structures, they managed to win the support of the President and the Premier and institutionalize communication channels with high-level officials in the Executive Yuan, the use of emotion work to create bridging social capital helped them earn civil servants’ trust, even leading to the emergence of femocrats. As trust, mutual benefits and regular networking between these women’s activists and government departments accumulated, the CWRP’s executive power and influence increased, leading to the establishment of many gender equality institutions. This paper discusses three theories and their significances in practice: (1) the dichotomous differentiation of social movement and institutional politics, and how it can be broken, (2) social capital, and how it can strengthen the relationship between the women’s movement and the State and increase the CWRP’s governance capacity, and (3) in response to arguments of state feminism, the suggestion of an ideal type for the relationship between women’s movement and the CWRP.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-32/32-01abs.pdf,32,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
Constructing Fairness: The Evolution and Effects of Pigeon Oceanic Racing in Taiwan,"Yu-ju Chien, Ya-ching Huang","pigeon racing, pigeon oceanic racing, underground economy, gambling, social trust","This article explains the evolution of the unique pigeon oceanic racing in Taiwan by investigating racers’ shared values, winning strategies, and social interactions. Taiwan pigeon racing is known as the toughest race in the world. In this so-called “Five-Race Championship,” juvenile pigeons have to fly over the open ocean more than five times, if they survive fierce winds and unpredictable weather. Regardless of a young bird’s competition records, its racing career finishes in one season. Prize money and associated illegal betting can add up to millions of NT dollars per race. Racers are enchanted by the enormous challenges and rewards. Previous literature tends to suggest that pigeon racers are driven by either personal affection for animals or irrational beliefs in gambling. These individualistic explanations fail to recognize how institutional regulations and social networks hold this racing/gambling industry together. By analyzing archival data, interviewing racers, and observing pigeon bids, we find that Taiwanese pigeon-racing rules gradually evolved to reinforce racers’ shared sense of fairness. Pigeonracing clubs adopted complicated gambling rules, young bird races, tough oceanic racing, and rigorous anti-cheating methods to prevent dishonesty, kidnappings, and other unfair practices. Most racers believe that these tough competitions, though increasing uncertainty, ensure everyone a fair chance of winning. Although most racers recognize that people with greater economic capital and experiences are advantaged, they admit that luck often intervenes, which makes the races fairer. Racers develop various types of tactical knowledge and cooperative strategies to manage risks. Their collective belief in “fairness by chance” sustains this multibillion dollar gambling industry. Social trust among participants may be undermined, however, because racers tend to keep personal winning tactics a secret. This research contributes to the underground economy literature by illustrating how institutional rules, shared values, and social trust co-evolve through gambling activities.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-32/32-02abs.pdf,32,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
"Imagining Futurity: Taiwan Biobank, Taiwanese Genes as a Niche, and Nation-Building","Yu-yueh Tsai, Wan-ju Lee","gene, biobank, imaginary, nation-building, bio-political paradigm","This article analyzes the establishment and development of Taiwan Biobank in terms of the concept of an “imagined future community.” We argue that life sciences and social imaginaries of the futurity of scientists have played an increasingly important role in nation-building in the globalization era. First, this article examines the institutional conditions under which scientists’ imaginaries are able to be practiced. Since the democratizing decade of the 1990s, the Taiwanese government has established inter-departmental/inter-ministerial dialogue platforms, where internationally reputed scientists can join in decision-making processes regarding science and technology policy and exercise their influence by promoting innovative basic research of biomedicine, with a view to upgrading the national economy in the globalizing competition of the knowledge economy. Second, the advocacy of the notion of “Taiwanese subjectivity” in politics since the late 1980s has influenced the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The human classification emphasizing Taiwanese identity (rather than Chinese identity) has shaped the knowledge-making of such scientific projects as Taiwan Biobank, in which the discourses of “Taiwan must have its own laboratory” and “Taiwanese unique genetic composition is characterized by its multiple ethnic origins” prevail. Also, the Taiwan Biobank aims to recruit national citizens and calls on “Taiwanese to work together for a healthy future generation.” This recruitment strategy and discourse, in turn, has the potential to build common imaginaries and emotions of Taiwanese as an imagined future community. Third, we argue that imaginaries of scientists are not purely scientific. The future imaginaries involved in scientific discourses are coproduced with identity politics in Taiwan and have obvious social and political implications.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-32/32-03abs.pdf,32,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
Computational Sociology: A New Sociological Area Empowered by Modern Computational and Digital Technology,"Yen-sheng Chiang, Sheng-wei Chen","Computational Sociology, computer simulation, Big Data, digital and informational technology","Recent decades have witnessed an explosive growth of modern computational and digital technology. Not only do advancements in computational power make it possible to process massive information in a split second, but the emergence of modern social media that draws on computational power also has dominated almost every economic transaction and social interaction in daily life. The article presents an introduction to a new research area in sociology that benefits from the digital revolution–computational sociology. We divide the research area in two categories: The first type of research uses computers to model or simulate complex social phenomena that are otherwise difficult to disentangle due to a lack of or limited access to real data. This kind of computational approach explains underlying mechanisms of the social phenomena in which we are interested. The second type of research, often known as the “big data approach”, uses social media to collect data or test sociological theories. This kind of approach offers an opportunity to observe natural, real-time interactions among people in different domains of social life. In the paper, we list a few representative examples of research for each category to illustrate in more detail the characteristics and merits of computational sociology. A brief methodological discussion of the two approaches is presented, along with a note on their implications for the scholarship of Taiwan",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-32/32-04abs.pdf,32,2016,Taiwanese Sociology
Bring Disease Back In? Exploring Modes of Disease Objectification in Patients’ Practices,Wen-yuan Lin,"Disease, Illness, Science, Technology and Society Studies (STS), Boundary object, Disease objectification","Medical sociologists have developed various paradigms for the social analysis of illness. Critics highlight that the sociology of illness reduces disease into social categories and ignores the specificity of diseases, clinical indexes, and practical norms and call for a sociology of disease. This paper critically follows the initiative without following the divide and convergence between disease and illness and bringing only disease back in. Drawing from practical ontology and studies of objectification practices, especially those of boundary and multiple disease objects, from science, technology, and society studies, this paper explores the multiple disease objects and modes of objectification symmetrically. By examining kidney patients’ multiple medical practices that interfere with each other, this study shows that we cannot bring the biomedical chronical kidney disease back in without taking multiple disease objects and modes of objectification into account. The conclusion examines the agenda of this approach, with a reflection on the specificity of existing theoretical tools, and proposes a sociology that faces multiple medical practices in a specific medico-social context.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-33/33-01abs.pdf,33,2017,Taiwanese Sociology
A Place-Bound Factory: Changing Labor Regimes in Taiwanese Manufacturers to Inland China,Jian-bang Deng,"transformation and future of Taiwanese businesses, migration, GPNs, rural migrant workers, labor regime","Past studies on the labor regimes of foreign companies in Southern China show that there was a prevalent and coercive workplace discipline, particularly within Taiwanese factories. Even though certain changes were foundin new labor management studies, labor control in these factories was still dominant, possessing the characteristics of a “migrant labor regime.” This kind of labor management, however, failed to reflect the reality of the workplace within inland Taiwanese factories. This paper employs theories from Global Production Networks, as well as Michael Burawoy’s perspective regarding the factory regime, to explore the changing labor regimes of Taiwanese factories in inland China. Empirical material for this paper was generated from two phases of fieldwork, in which 163 in-depth interviews were conducted from 2011 to 2015 with Chinese employees and Taiwanese managers, as well as other researchrelated interviewees. It is argued that a re-combination of “two scales of action” towards rural migrant workers in inland Taiwanese factories developed as these factories moved from coastal to inland China. Instead of the past recruitment practices of long-distance migration laborers moving to coastal areas, factories mostly recruited inland employees (so-called local workers) from nearby villages and towns. These local workers showed, in many aspects, less similar characteristics to those of migrant workers in Southern China, including their conditions of dependence, moral values, and social relationships. “Inland,” from this viewpoint, not only is a geographic term, it also functioned as a geographic scale, having an enormous impact on the labor regime of migrated Taiwanese factories. Factories located inland were forced to respond to workers’ systematic needs, including those related to familial reproduction, seasonal farming, and community. Moreover, adjustments to the labor regime of inland Taiwanese factories brought them to become “territorially” embedded in workers’ localized networks and inland rural economies. Factories thus became place-bound.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-33/33-02abs.pdf,33,2017,Taiwanese Sociology
Policing Protest in China: Findings from Newspaper Data,Chih-jou Jay Chen,"social movement, collective protests, coercion, stability maintenance, social conflicts","This paper examines state responses to social protests in contemporary China, thereby demonstrating the institutional logic of governance. The data source for this research is a database of more than 10,000 news events on mass protests from 2000 to 2015. Empirically, the main findings of this study include the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2015, the percentage of police responding to collective protests by force increased steadily, the police were more and more inclined to crack down on social protests. (2) The police’s suppression of protests in rural areas was the most serious, followed by those in second-tier cities, and last, by those in large cities. Police in large cities were the most tolerant of collective protests. (3) Erupting violence was one of the main factors leading to police attendance at protest scenes, as well as the arrest of protesters. (4) The larger the scale of a protest, the more likely the police were to appear on the scene. By contrast, the police were more inclined to arrest protesters at small protests. (5) Police responses were influenced first and foremost by who was protesting and not necessarily by the protest issues or targets. When protests targeted local governments (rather than central or provincial governments), police were more likely to attend the protests and arrest protesters. The underlying reason for police attendance and arresting protesters, however, was that the protesters were members of disadvantaged groups. To pursue effective governance and protect the authority of the central government, local governments faced with collective protests habitually resort to modes of reaction that enable them quell protests quickly, while sacrificing the interests of disadvantaged groups, making the institutionalization of social conflicts impossible.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-33/33-03abs.pdf,33,2017,Taiwanese Sociology
Aluba as a Form of Male Youth “High” Culture in Play,"Herng-dar Bih, Haitao Huang, Wen-lung Hung, Bo-han Pan","bullying, hazing, masculinities, adolescent, play","Aluba is a popular high-school campus activity among adolescent males that had been transformed from pole-racking. In aluba, however, the real groin attack became a make-believe one, more people participated in the play, including the shouters, and the ablubaee was a buddy rather than an outsider. This play started to become popular in the mid-1980s, around the time of the abolition of martial law. It has been a precious memory of adolescent males for decades. There is, however, a lack of empirical studies on this form of male culture. Aluba has been depicted as a kind of sexual bullying and was abolished by both Ministry of Education and Ministry of National Defense. Based on 45 interviews and visual texts, this research tries to analyze and answer the question: Is Aluba play or bullying? In addition, the authors show the development of aluba, its gender implications, and the reasons for its popularity on high-school campuses.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-34/34-01abs.pdf,34,2017,Taiwanese Sociology
Objectification of the Gender Equity Education Act in Higher Education: An Institutional Ethnographic Exploration,Pei-ru Liao,"Institutional Ethnography, Gender Equity Education Act, frontline workers, objectification, work knowledge","Enforcement of the Gender Equity Education Act has enabled schools at all levels to properly and legally process cases of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or bullying on campus. This Act standardizes and generalizes the procedure for handling gender-based violence at all school levels. The researcher incorporates Institutional Ethnography as a method of inquiry, a starting point to form a problematic, and an analytic tool to map out the process of objectification of frontline workers. Starting from frontline workers’ standpoint, this article presents the way in which different “texts” coordinate frontline workers’ everyday work and their relations with other administrative staff. Identifying four types of texts in the local setting, the researcher demonstrates how frontline workers establish work knowledge based on the Act as well as the administrative system, as well as the workers’ potential for utilizing work knowledge and its limits.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-34/34-02abs.pdf,34,2017,Taiwanese Sociology
Globalization and Laborers’ Dilemma: Analyzing Strike and Lockout Data for the 1969-2015 Period,Wen-yang Chang,"strikes, lockouts, globalization, trade, foreign direct investment","This research note examines whether, during the globalization era, laborers increase the use of strikes and lockouts for specific purposes. Previous empirical studies tend to pay more attention to specific regions or countries, while few of them focus on global data. To know whether strikes and lockouts increase or decrease in the face of economic and other consequences of globalization, this note applies data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) covering the 1969-2015 period of 98 countries. Initial findings confirm that, first, the likelihood of strikes and lockouts is negatively correlated with trade, foreign direct investment, and globalization-related indicators, respectively. Second, such findings are consistent when we apply the multiple imputation technique. This observation helps us understand whether laborers can improve their working conditions by strikes and lockouts and provides policy implications.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-34/34-03abs.pdf,34,2017,Taiwanese Sociology

Differing from the prevalent arguments that generally identify economic needs and regime survival as the main reasons for the growth of higher education, this article brings the Civil War and Cold War that Taiwan was encountering back into the field of higher education, and elaborates how and why the two wars shaped Taiwan's higher education system. More than just nursing specific areas of study, to mobilize society for war, the two wars also confined the character of university, as well as the concept of justice of education in a fundamental way. Taking a macro perspective, rather than situating war as a hidden factor or a background component, I highlight the impacts of war on education.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-34/34-04abs.pdf,34,2017,Taiwanese Sociology
Embedded Temporal Experience: An Analysis of the Temporal Structure of Social Media Usage in Daily Life,Chen-yi Yu,"social media, temporal experience, lifelogging, routine","The material affordances of social media can transcend the boundaries of time, which may lead to new temporal experiences. This study uses a mobile phone app and a web browser (Chrome) to collect temporal data of users' social media usage and divides temporality into five dimensions, including duration, tempo, temporal location, cycles, and exception, to construct the temporal structure of social media uses in daily life. The results show that usage of social media in daily life contributes to an embedded temporal experience. This means that even if social media have the material affordance to transcend the boundaries of time, the way they are located in the temporal structure of daily life is embedded in a specific context and becomes personally meaningful by negotiating with social relations, cultural expectations, technical support, and life rituals. Proposing the embeddedness of social media, we can see that the usage of social media is not only passively adopted on a material basis, but it is also actively incorporated based on individual contexts. People embody various forms of agency, including crafts of management, selection, control, and negotiation, to develop a unique order and meanings of social media's existence in daily life",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-35/35-01abs.pdf,35,2018,Taiwanese Sociology
Pursuing Teaching Excellence or Fallacy? Institutional Ethnography of Performance Management in Higher Education Reform in Taiwan,Yu-hsuan Lin,"institutional ethnography, Teaching Excellence Project (TEP), key performance indicator (KPI), new managerialism, university governance","Since the mid-1990s, the governance of higher education in Taiwan has been influenced by new managerialism, and hence started to make extensive use of key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the effectiveness of educational programs. By means of performance management, the government expects that universities can be guided to use public funds effectively and enhance the quality of education. However, there are many contradictions and disjunctures between the responses from universities and the intention of the policy. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to reveal 1) how this new form of managerial technique has been implemented, 2) how it changes people’s working processes/practices, and 3) what effects it has. The research adopts institutional ethnography (IE) to investigate a private university that has been awarded Teaching Excellence Project (TEP). Data gathering techniques include interviews with administrative managers, staff, teachers, and students at the university and the collection of relevant documents, which are submitted to text analyses. This close examination of “how things actually happen” traces the actual practices of university workers at various levels under this governance policy reform and the changes it brings. The results show that KPI mandates have activated a ruling apparatus of de-professionalism. The workers are further driven to develop market-orientated work ethics. This, in turn, transforms the social relations between and/or within the administration and pedagogical developments, alongside the labor processes/practices. In a critical dialogue with IE, the study concludes with methodological reflections on and breakthroughs in applying IE.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-35/35-02abs.pdf,35,2018,Taiwanese Sociology
When Community Building Meets Participatory Budgeting: A Comparison between Two Communities,"Yu-sheng Lin, Dung-sheng Chen","civic association, deliberative community building, participatory budgeting, political culture","Civic associations are regarded as a foundation of democracy. In this article, we examine the relationship between civic associations and democracy by observing the operation of participatory budgeting (PB) in the project of community building. Participatory budgeting is a model of civic participation, where by engaging in community deliberations, ordinary people can decide how the budget will be allotted. Theoretically, a veteran community should have better PB performance than a rookie community, because the former is used to engaging with democratic processes. We found, however, that the veteran community demonstrated a more centralized political culture than the rookie community did. Consequently, the process and outcome of PB in the veteran community reflected the will of local elites. In contrast, the rookie community was more open to community members who owned more authority to decide the budget. We argue that the reasons behind this difference are the constraints of the rules and procedures of community building, the emergence of the community hero, and the resources that a community has. We suggest that future studies can focus on the influence of different political cultures in various civic associations on democratic practices and how democratic practices shape the political cultures of civic associations.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-35/35-03abs.pdf,35,2018,Taiwanese Sociology
"“Study Well, Play Well”: Extracurricular Club Activities, Educational Practices, and Youth Culture in Taiwan’s Elite High Schools",Chi-chung Wang,"educational reform, status competition, extra-curricular club, youth culture, career","This article explores the relationship between Taiwanese academically elite students’ culture and their schooling experience. The main purpose of this study is to reveal the core logic of the exam-oriented educational system’s operation in contemporary Taiwan. In so doing, I first demonstrate that the thriving extracurricular club activities in publicly funded elite high schools are part of a wider subcultural milieu and are characterized by the collective pursuit of “dual excellence in both study and play,” which has been shaped by educational policy changes implemented since the late 1980s. Some particular subcultures --earlier associated with problematic, low-achieving youth groups --were gradually legitimized among academically elite youth during this transformation process. Exam success is no longer sufficient for high-school students to secure distinction within their peer group: Excellence in leisure activities is also pursued in this postmartial-law era. My findings suggest that students’ extracurricular club activities and academic pursuits exist in a symbiotic relationship. The collectively shared cultural need to pursue leisure accomplishments intersects with educational institutions, as students adapt strategies characterized by rote learning to their club activities. First- and second-year students’ outstanding achievement in extracurricular club activities leads to them being willing to dedicate themselves to intensive rote academic learning in their third year, as they prepare for university entry exams, thus contributing to the reproduction of the logic of educational competition. Students from elite public high schools seem to have more leeway and time to pursue leisure accomplishments. I argue, however, that both their leisure and academic activities proceed in a compressed manner. The thriving extracurricular club activity in public elite high schools is an arena extended from academic examinations for accommodating status competition, which functions to support students’ compliance with an examination-oriented educational regime marked by rote learning and intensive competition.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-36/36-01abs.pdf,36,2018,Taiwanese Sociology
Situating Differences: The Case of Health Education Deployments for Diabetes,Wen-yuan Lin,"Diabetes, health education, medicalization, bio-power, analysis of regime of practice, epistemic deployment","How should researchers think about the differences in practices of medical expansion? What is the importance of the knowing practices for situating these differences? Being part of the practices, what can sociology learn and what difference can sociology make in these practices? This paper explores such issues in the case of diabetes health education. In Taiwan, while the nationwide Diabetes Shared Care Network was launched more than 20 years ago, its local performances and practices vary. Drawing on insights into differences from health education studies, the “turn to differences” in medicalization and bio-power theories, and interactionism and Science, Technology, and Society (STS), this paper uses regime of practice analysis to specify the deployments of enlightenment, efficacy, coaching, team, and health-oriented modes of health education. It particularly highlights the epistemic deployment for analyzing matters of concern, apparatuses, and effects of the deployments. This paper concludes by elaborating how the concept of epistemic deployment and regime of practice analysis help to specify the differences in messy clinical work, the contexts of health education, and the agenda for social theory",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-36/36-02abs.pdf,36,2018,Taiwanese Sociology
Patterns and Changes of Transition to Adulthood in Taiwan,"Kang-jung Weng, Yeu-sheng Hsieh","transition to adulthood, life course, life event duration and order, age norm, multichannel sequence analysis","This study explores the transition to adulthood in the cohort period spanning from 1935 to 1984 in Taiwan by adopting the life course approach, in an effort to identify typical transition to adulthood types, their features, relationships to demographics, and cohort variations. Combining two surveys, the Taiwan Social Change Survey, 1996 and the Social Stratification and Social Mobility in Three Eastern Asian Countries, 2005, we employ Multichannel Sequence Analysis to analyze 7,248 respondents’ life event data. We identified different kinds of transition to adulthood types in each birth cohort period. We found apparent cohort changes during the transition to adulthood, including longer duration and more diversity in the order of life events. The outset time of transition to adulthood changed from early to late, and the first event changed from finishing school to more starting work. The “anchoring effect” of first marriage identified in the early cohort weakened, leading to a change from “early start and late completion, late start and early completion” to “early start and early completion, late start and late completion” among the types having high completion rates. Sex and family socioeconomic status continue to have significant effects on the transition to adulthood, and the advantaged/disadvantaged demographic features tend to overlap in certain types. The advantaged groups, namely males with high family socioeconomic status, have longer duration and more flexibility in the transition to adulthood. Their higher rates of not completing life events demands more reflection on the legitimacy of stereotyping those who do not finish life events on time as failures. The most disadvantaged group, females with low family socioeconomic status, shows opposite characteristics to those of the overall trend. Having the shortest duration and the normative path in the transition to adulthood demands that people in this type make the most effort to adjust to the impacts of frequently changing life events.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-36/36-03abs.pdf,36,2018,Taiwanese Sociology
Between Charity and Rights: How Disabled People Fought for Their Transportation Discounts in Taiwan between 1950 and 1980,Tasing Chiu,"welfare history, sociology of law, disability studies, history of blindness","The 1980s are seen as an important era in the transition of welfare for the disabled from traditional philanthropy to civil rights. Many welfare policies and programs for the disabled created after the 1980s, howvever, did not suddenly emerge out of nowhere. Prior to this time, many groups of people with disabilities had fought continuously for the establishment of a more comprehensive social welfare system.

"Social Media and Network Boundaries among College Students: Reconstructing Companions, Conversations, and Contact Circles","Ming-yi Chang, Yang-chih Fu","network boundary, social media, social circles, sampling surveys, multilevel analysis","As a fundamental issue of social network studies, the boundaries of personal networks are always hard to specify and differentiate. Not only is it challenging to conceptualize how far an individual’s social circles may reach, but it also poses a daunting task for researchers to design effective approaches that help construct comprehensive network structures with clear boundaries. Conventional network generators based on surveys and other methods help reveal network boundaries by relying heavily on participants’ cognitive abilities to recall or estimate how they interact and connect with others, which can result in various biases or errors. With the surge of social media, researchers have unprecedented opportunities to avoid such recall biases and errors by using automatically recorded data of social networking, even though the new communication means often accommodate fl eeting contacts that make network boundaries more contingent. To explore how network boundaries emerge on social media, this study integrates data from both sampling surveys and social media. Based on multi-stage clustered sampling, we interviewed 1,531 senior students from 58 college departments in Taiwan who completed an online survey and authorized the use of their contact records on Facebook. The interaction records at both contact and tie levels on Facebook helped us identify who may comprise each of three network subnets located from core to periphery: companions, conversations, and contact circles. Paired with sociodemographic variables taken from the online survey, these contact records further facilitated multilevel analyses on how network structures in a particular academic year affect network size and boundaries in the following year. Overall, while personal networks on Facebook tend to expand when a user updated his or her activity posts more frequently and regularly in the previous year, the size of core networks also increases if more network members in the previous year were similar to the user in terms of sociodemographic background and online behaviors. In addition to revealing how network structures help expand subsequent personal network size, this study shows how an integrated approach of combining survey data from a nationally representative sample with Facebook contact records helps delineate the boundaries of subsets in personal networks.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-37/37-01abs.pdf,37,2019,Taiwanese Sociology
Negotiating “Developmental Imperatives”: Childrearing Practices and Parental Governance in Early Childhood,Fan-tzu Tseng,"scientifi c childrearing, early childhood development, expert advices, mothering practices, parental governance","This study explores the discursive construction of parenthood and mothers’ experiences in the process of “scientifi c childrearing” and focuses on contemporary parenting advice for early childhood development. The analysis is based on qualitative interview data from 41 mothers and related postings by mothers on two online parenting forums. These new parenting discourses are conceptualized as “developmental imperatives” and categorized into four themes: emotional attachment, social adaptation, intellectual potential, and normality. Each theme incorporates specific scientific theories, childhood perspectives, problematics, childrearing techniques, and aspects of the mother’s role. The dominance of these developmental imperatives is enhanced by extant ideologies of motherhood, while the new parenting discourses have expanded the range of mothers’ responsibilities for the child and resorted to concepts of “crucial periods” to ensure mothers’ engagement. This study finds mothers’ preference for the specific developmental imperative depending on its assumption about childhood and developmental goods, but mothers’ daily practices have been compromised by their resources. In addition, young children’s own temperaments and abilities also strongly influence mothers’ choice, adaptation, and reflection on expert advice and authority. Since the child is an actor in the parent-child relationship, no developmental goals and mothering practices can be actualized without his or her willingness and collaboration.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-37/37-02abs.pdf,37,2019,Taiwanese Sociology

The Story of “We-NGO”: Explaining the Networks and Solidarity of the Sunfl ower Occupy Movement,"En-en Hsu, Jieh-min Wu, Tsung-tang Lee, I-lun Shih","social movement, contentious politics, Sunfl ower Occupy Movement, movement solidarity, China factor","Rather than embodying solidarity, many social protest movements have ended in internal schism. The Sunflower Occupy Movement of 2014, however, overcame the solidarity problem and resulted in what was to be an unprecedented protest in modern Taiwanese history in terms of both its duration and scale of mobilization. This movement involved a large number of social movement and nongovernmental organization (NGO) activists, who mobilized resources and devoted themselves wholeheartedly to supporting the 24-day occupation. The Sunflower Occupy Movement originated in a campaign against the Cross-Strait Services Trade Agreement (CSSTA) signed by the ruling Kuomintang government and the People’s Republic of China in 2013. In the wake of that signing, social movement groups forged an umbrella organization, Democratic Front, to campaign against the CSSTA and played a pivotal role in the subsequent Sunfl ower Occupy Movement. This paper, employing an organizational perspective and using the Polish Solidarity Movement as a reference case, explains the origin of movement solidarity within the Sunfl ower Occupy Movement. Methodologically, we used a triangulation strategy composed of quantitative network analysis and qualitative in-depth interviews. The network analysis demonstrates trends in the cross-issue mobilization of the social movement sector and how intensifi ed co-operation led to a high level of coalition, which was indispensable for movement solidarity. Interviews with social movement activists illuminate the micro-processes and dynamics of network-formation, norm-making, and solidarization within the movement circle. The movement’s master frame is constituted of “defending democracy” and “fi ghting China,” while adopting “civil society” as a collectiveaction frame. In these ways, we reconstruct the “We-NGO narrative” that activists invented during the movement to strongly express their mutual trust and collective identity. The Sunflower Occupy Movement represents not merely a student movement, but a series of large-scale protests of a broader and lasting civic movement. This paper thereby contributes to a deeper understanding of this eventful mobilization.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-38/38-01abs.pdf,38,2019,Taiwanese Sociology

I develop a subject-actingwithin-the-field lens to articulate the two perspectives, showing how the subjectivity of the homeless in Taiwan is realized in social interactions and social reproduction situated in the historical process of political economic and cultural development. Based on ethnographic data, I display how three types of homeless, defi ned via the possession of jiang-hu capital and physical-mental state, make their respective living differently, based on the interplay between their habitus shaped by previous lived experiences, their current resources, and the homeless environment. Meanwhile, they all construct identities and maintain their dignity by engaging against each other in moral boundary-making work. Through this paper, I demonstrate a particular process of social reproduction, where the homeless strive hard but fail to exit from poverty in the Taiwanese contexts of political economy and charity culture.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-38/38-02abs.pdf,38,2019,Taiwanese Sociology
The Divergence and Integration of Local/Indigenous Consciousness in Hong Kong under the China Factor: From 2003 to 2016,Tsu-bang Cheng,"local/indigenous consciousness, China factor, democracy, nation, Hong Kong","With the growth of its political and economic influences, China has been impacting the world differently. Located on the periphery of China, Taiwan and Hong Kong have complicated connections with China in both geopolitics and history. In this paper, we observe many social conflicts and contradictions in the interactive process among Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China. There is an interesting and paradoxical phenomenon: The more closely these areas are integrated, the greater is the local/indigenous consciousness in Taiwan and Hong Kong. With the framework of the China factor’s action and reaction, we focus on the development of local/ indigenous consciousness in Hong Kong. In addition to confronting Chinese nationalism, there has been a complex and unique development of Hong Kong’s local/indigenous consciousness: cleavages and confl icts, along with the changing political situation. In the analysis, we propose three types of local/indigenous consciousness: democratic reunification, democratic self-determination, and national self-determination. These three types also correspond to three modes of contention: peaceful, rational and non-violence, and no foul language/ civil disobedience/ brave fight. Different types of local/indigenous discourses have their own supporters regarding different affections, interests, and ideologies. Different supporters also employ different resistance strategies based on their discourses. Furthermore, these cleavages bring about integration problems in Hong Kong’s democratic movement.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-38/38-03abs.pdf,38,2019,Taiwanese Sociology
Evaluation of Word-of-Mouth Information by Retail Stock Investors in Taiwan,Yu-hsiang Chen,"retail investor, word-of-mouth information, fi nancial markets, evaluation studies, social relationship","Transmission of word-of-mouth information is common among Taiwanese stock investors, but the quality of word-of-mouth information is diffi cult to evaluate directly solely by the content of the information. The evaluative frame is composed of measurements of the social characteristics of information providers. “The tie with the information provider” and “the profession of the information provider” are the key proxy indices used in the evaluation. The profession here refers not only to “fi nancial expertise” but also “trading skills” and “access to insider information”. Financial knowledge, fundamental analysis and technical analysis are usually adopted by investors to confi rm the value of information. Afterwards, “the accuracy of information provided” is employed by investors to re-evaluate the “profession” of and “relationship” with the information providers. The contribution of this paper is to highlight the importance of the reliability of fi nancial information transmitted through social relations. The negative effects of following false fi nancial information, such as large trading loss, would make stock investors become concerned about the “risk” rather than the “novelty” of information and tend to more highly value the word-ofmouth information from strong ties.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-39/39-01abs.pdf,39,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
The Stranger in Participatory Budgeting,Yu-sheng Lin,"the stranger, participatory budgeting, deliberative communitybuilding, relation-building, social skill","This article uses a case study on deliberative community-building to consider the role of organizers in Participatory Budgeting (PB) from the perspective of relational sociology. Inspired by Georg Simmel’s masterpiece “The Stranger”, this article argues that PB may reach its ideals when the organizer builds strangership with locals. When the organizer obtains stranger status, the organizer is more likely to mobilize different local groups, set impartial PB rules, and connect local groups with different interests. This article also argues that the organizer has to build strangership through two kinds of identity work to create a feeling among locals that the stranger organizer is concurrently both remote and near. This identity work involves both distinguishing themselves from locals while also suppressing differences to better blend with locals, i.e., compartmentalizing and conflating performances. In the end, this article discusses the conditions that constrain the organizer’s performance as the stranger, specifies what kinds of organizer are more likely to obtain stranger status, and rethinks authority from the perspective of social communication.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-39/39-02abs.pdf,39,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
A New Interpretation of Secularization in China: The Signifi cance to World History of the Rise of Popular Religions after the Tang-Song Transition,Chih-chieh Tang,"secularization, differentiation, reciprocal comparison, popular religion, Tang-Song transition","In this article, secularization refers to a religion’s structural transformation as it encounters functional differentiation. The religious area is thereby differentiated, but not separated from other social areas. On the contrary, through this transformation, religion tries to realize its ultimate end, living a religious life in the secular world. Whether the religion can go beyond organization and become a differentiated functional system depends on whether it can provide salvation to everyone regardless of one’s character, role or status. When religion has in principle included all the people, it must leave one to decide for oneself whether one believes this religion or not. Taking these theoretical assumptions as the point of departure, I reexamine the development of religion in China with the guiding problem being how religion becomes differentiated in society. Two developments that break the bottleneck of inclusion are highlighted: the “pure land” belief that reciting Buddha’s name suffi ces to bring salvation, and the Chan school view that daily ordinary things bring the chance of enlightenment. Furthermore, I analyze why the popular religions, arising after the Tang-Song transition, are functionally equivalent to the Reformation from the view of reciprocal comparison. These popular religions are not only an embodiment of secularization in China, but also pioneers of secularization in the world. With this case analysis, I illustrate the theoretical potential of reciprocal comparison in the reconceptualization of secularization.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-39/39-03abs.pdf,39,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
"On Rent: The Guangdong Model, Rent-Seeking Developmental State, and Capitalism",Gwo-shyong Shieh,"Global value chain, rent seeking, developmental state, surplus value, capitalism","The book Rent-Seeking Developmental State in China highlights the Guangdong model as the prototype of Chinese economic development since 1979 under which local governments acting as institutional rent seekers patronize foreign manufacturing enterprises, taking advantage of emigrant workers discriminated against by the household register system. This paper initiates a series of dialogues on the conditions, production and meanings of “rent,” a core category of the book. This paper considers the book from the perspective of the history of the capitalism. Taking the legacy of socialism as an example of the encounter of local society with capitalism, a condition of rent-production and seeking, it then contrasts the framework of articulation studies (the articulation of modes of production, the articulation of worldviews, and the articulation of native and capitalistic categories) with that of “expansion of the value chain” and “local growth alliance” proposed by the book. Unlike the book’s emphasis on rentseeking, this paper calls attention to the production of rent itself and the multiple meanings of rent to highlight the role of meaning vis-a-vis that of institutional arrangements. It then briefly reflects on the so-called “theoretical dialogue.” This paper concludes with a discussion of the role of commitment in the production of a solid academic work.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-39/39-04abs.pdf,39,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
Skill Formation Regime under Dependent Development: Revisiting the Formation and Transformation of Vocational Industrial Education in Taiwan (1949-1986),Chih-peng Cheng,"Vocational industrial education, developmental state, skill formation, work study program, and varieties of capitalism/skill formation","Taiwan, as a late comer to capitalism, has become a newlyindustrialized country after 40 years of economic development. However, the skill formation behind the economic miracle is under-researched, with vocational industrial education particularly so. Some studies explain skill formation of Taiwan and other East Asian newly-industrialized countries from the perspective of developmental state and argue that human resources policy is a direct response to economic development. However, this argument does not pay enough attention to course curriculum development and it also neglects the roles of the US and Germany in shaping Taiwan's vocational industrial education. Therefore, this paper argues that the perspective of “dependent development” can better explain the skill formation system in Taiwan. This not only helps us revise the state-centered view that has been used to explain the cultivation of East Asia's human capital, but also highlights the bias of methodological nationalism lurking in historical and comparative institutional analysis (varieties of capitalism/ skill formation) based on advanced industrial democracies.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-40/40-01abs.pdf,40,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
Industrial Upgrading and Technology Diffusion in the Taiwan Automotive Parts Sector: From Gunpowder and Gas Cylinders to Airbags,Ching-keng Liu,"technology diffusion, the politics of subcontracting, airbag, industrial upgrading, auto parts","The global airbag market is highly oligopolistic because of the high precision and stability required during production. As such, there are extremely high barriers for entry. The automotive industry in Taiwan has always been regarded as “a babe in arms” and unable to shake off the predicament of technological dependence. Taking into account these difficulties, it remains unanswered as to why the National ChungShan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) and Taiwanese manufacturers were able to develop key technologies for airbags independently and export them to international markets including Europe, the Middle East, and Malaysia in the 1990s. How did they succeed? What are the theoretical and empirical implications of this history? This article examines the technological changes in Taiwan’s airbag industry from the perspectives of production modularization, the politics of subcontracting, and technology diffusion. Firstly, the modular production promoted by European and American automakers in the 1990s brought opportunities for Taiwanese manufacturers to join the multinational division of labor in car manufacturing. Secondly, the existing technology transfer model centered on automakers was not sufficient to explain the technical learning of parts manufacturers. This article introduces the concept of the politics of subcontracting to explain the limitations of the existing conceptual model. Finally, and in contrast to the technology transfer model, the NCSIST, GSKIT, and MOSA’s R&D approach demonstrates how technology diffusion occurring in their own industrial bases of airbag manufacturing highlights the characteristics of Taiwan’s decentralized industrialization, which is conducive to the cross-industry diffusion of technology and achieves the goal of technological learning and industrial upgrading.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-40/40-02abs.pdf,40,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
"Governing AIDS, Rescaling the Social: A Global Ethnography Perspective",Po-chia Tseng,"AIDS governance, global ethnography, globalization, rescaling, resistance","Over the past three decades, HIV/AIDS has become a central global health concern, and studies on the global governance of AIDS have also increased signifi cantly. Drawing on a global ethnography perspective, this article offers a review of several empirical studies on AIDS governance in transnational contexts, with a focus on the making and remaking of social scales in transnational processes. Instead of “black-boxing” globalization, a methodology of global ethnography views globalization as a product of specifi c political, economic, cultural, or social projects, it seeks to unpack the ways in which social relations across sites and scales are imagined, built, and experienced by situated actors. This review article demonstrates that research on AIDS governance may benefit from such an approach by incorporating an analysis of how multi-scalar power relations are implicated in AIDS responses located in certain areas. Moreover, in the review, the article highlights some of the salient political implications of neoliberalism for AIDS governance, including the responsibilization of the nongovernmental sector and the entrepreneurialization of patient subjects. It concludes with a reflection on potential directions for future work on AIDS governance that involve a grounded perspective of globalization.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-40/40-03abs.pdf,40,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
Deliberative Democracy and Its Discontents: An Analysis of Pioneering Participatory Budgeting Projects in Taiwan (2015-2018),"Meng-tsung Lu, Hsin-yi Yeh","participatory budgeting, deliberative democracy, citizen participation, administrative reform","While participatory budgeting (PB) has been promoted and conducted in many cities in various countries for decades, the “PB boom” did not occur in Taiwan until 2015. Employing several pioneering PB projects in Taiwan as examples, this article examines discontents among heterogeneous social actors in response to the promotion of PB and analyzes the reasons behind such discontents by conducting 184 indepth interviews and long-term participant observations. Using various discourses, the discontents oppose PB at its propagandizing and recruiting stage, its deliberative-discussing stage, its project-executing stage, and its budget-cancellation stage. These discontents can be further categorized as doubts about PB's practical executions, reconsiderations about the values and content of deliberative democracy, judgements about the relationships between new modes of public participation and democratic politics, and so on. To consider how to further promote PB, we should first confront the discontents, then we can manage ways to justify and improve citizen participation in Taiwan. Moreover, we suggest that this article encapsulates the reasons behind the objections to citizen participation in general.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-40/40-04abs.pdf,40,2020,Taiwanese Sociology
"The Dynamics of Agriculture: Market Exchange, Redistribution and Reciprocity in Rural Taiwan","Yi-ting Chung, Gwo-shyong Shieh","agriculture, household farming, mechanism of allocating resources, Karl Polanyi","Is it possible to detect shifts in the development of Taiwanese agriculture over the past three decades when its role in the overall economy seems insignifi cant if not ignorable? This paper singles out three agricultural townships, Dou-nan, Mei-nong and Chi-shang, to demonstrate that vibrant and energetic agricultural development is unfolding thanks to mediating organizations that initiate innovative programs, namely, the farmers’ association in Dou-nan, a social movement in Mei-nong, and social groups in Chi-shang. Motivated by the ultimate concerns to which they are committed, these mediating organizations diagnose the status quo, initiate social innovations, and establish institutional mix by flexibly combining three mechanisms for allocating resources, that is, market exchange, redistribution and reciprocity, which is one of the secrets behind the crescendos of agricultural development in each case. This paper concludes with the contributions it may make to Karl Polanyi’s legacy by integrating institutional mix and the two-fold framework of the selfregulating market on the one hand and the economy as an instituted process on the other, and highlighting the importance of infrastructure and ultimate concerns in the institutional mix.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-41/41-01abs.pdf,41,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
The Operation and Consequences of the Social Welfare System for the Homeless in Taiwan: The Approach of Street-level Bureaucrat Governance,Ke-hsien Huang,"the homeless, state governance, street-level bureaucrat, social worker, fragile solidarity","Through democratization, the Taiwanese government has managed to de-criminalize the homeless, taking them as a minority to be helped and included in the social welfare system since the 1990s. A complete, progressive social-welfare system with various services and resources for the homeless has been established. However, many homeless people still think the welfare is useless to them. Why does this gap between policy and reality exist? In this study, I conduct an ethnography of both social workers and the homeless, adopting the approach of street-level bureaucrat governance to explain the operation and consequences of the system. The analysis starts by illustrating how despite the three trajectories—assistance for job search, returning home, and accommodation into facilities—the welfare policy expectation for the homeless to “exit from being homeless” has failed. Then, I display how fi rst-line workers govern the homeless on site through three tactful strategies—horizontally shuffling the burden, downwardly coopting, and upwardly realigning. The professional practice of case management along with the governing strategy of coopting further weaken the vulnerable social network among the homeless, which not only drives the homeless to misrecognize the factors of their social suffering but also make it difficult to maintain the solidarity of the economically disadvantaged. This article not only discusses the role of the state in managing the homeless, but contends that the two major but unrelated issues in poverty studies, state governance and ties among the poor, are indeed related. In conclusion, implications of the findings for homeless policy and intellectual development in Taiwan are discussed.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-41/41-02abs.pdf,41,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
"Caring for Children with Invisible Disabilities as Moral Work: Medical Model, Stigma and Anticipation",Fan-tzu Tseng,"invisible disabilities, social, emotional and behavioral disorders (SEBD), parental care, moral work, medical model","This study is situated in the contemporary phenomenon in which children are increasingly being diagnosed with social, emotional and behavioral disorders (SEBD), which bring both unique and common challenges to their families. I draw upon the category ""invisible disabilities"" to encompass these heterogeneous conditions, which in this study include attention defi cit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), learning disability, emotional and behavioral disabilities, and other psychiatric diagnoses. Through in-depth interviews with fifty primary caregivers, I examine how parents respond to the moral requirements posed by the characteristics of such SEBDs, that is the deviations from the norm as the main symptoms, the association with psychiatric care, and the anticipation of a deviant future. This study develops the concept of ""moral work"" to analyze three diff erent but related types of care practices: identifying the child's differential attributes and negotiating the medical model, managing the stigma of psychiatric disorders and protecting the child's discreditable self, and preparing their children to deal with an anticipated “bad” future. While caregiving is inherently a moral activity, when faced with highly value- or norm-laden conditions, the concept of moral work helps to reveal how these actors respond to these often-negative meanings, thus shaping their care trajectory. Such parental care cannot follow a standard script, but relies on parents as moral agents who strive to judge, experiment, and pursue outcomes that may be ""better"" for their children as they continually navigate between medical discourses, social situations, and love for their children. Even though it may not challenge the oppressive system, parents’ actions are always directed toward the moral transformation of self, the child, and even others, and open up possibilities for reshaping their lifeworld. The complexity of these moral endeavors underscores the moral lessons of parenthood, illness, and suff ering.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-41/41-03abs.pdf,41,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
"Development Regime, Clientelism, and Civic Practices: A Post-developmental Refl ection on an Aboriginal Village",Chuan-wei Hsia,"post-development, neoliberal governmentality, clientelism, civil society","By sketching the political, social and economic life of an aboriginal village on the mountainside of Kavulungan, this study explores how “development” was interpreted and pursued by villagers in an “underdeveloped” situation, and the possibility brought by local transformative actions. Rather than selecting a few successful cases for emulation, this study focuses on a case that resulted in “failure”, asking what positive lessons we can gain nevertheless. From a post-developmental perspective, this study finds that the “underdeveloped” condition of this village was represented and constructed by the integration of three distinct fi elds of discourses, i.e. civil society discourse, political studies of clientelism, and development discourse, which all presupposed dichotomies of Progress/Outdated, Modern/Premodern, Civil Society/Clientelism, representing the countryside as politically corrupt and economically underdeveloped. But as survival strategies of the subaltern, the value of democratic clientelism for empowerment and accountability was underestimated. Deconstructing the three discourses goes hand in hand with reevaluating clientelism, and is also part of reframing and re-narrativizing community resources and capabilities in the positive sense. Through the recognition of the diversity and vitality of community capabilities, a space for alternative actions grows.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-41/41-04abs.pdf,41,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
"Nation, Mediation, and the Structure of Feeling: How Chinese People Perceive Taiwan’s Pop Music",Chun-Ming Huang,"nations and nationalism, Taiwan and China, Mediation, Popular Music, Sociology of Culture and Music","Taiwan’s pop music is enormously popular in China. This has been neglected in research. This study aims to examine the reasons why this success has taken place while hostile political relations remain. Based on 35 in-depth interviews with Chinese audience-members who live in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Taipei, this article demonstrates how there exists a multi-mediated structure of feeling about ambiguous national and political identities towards Taiwan pop concerning its social use in China. On the one hand, Chinese people tend to idealise Taiwanese pop and produce reflexive resources to feed into their understanding when thinking about Taiwan and China, on the other hand, Chinese audiences may experience resistance to Taiwan’s pop when it contradicts their national identity: To engage, or to refuse to engage, in the process of listening, Chinese people, in particular, have shown various strategies, either to strengthen, reinvent and negotiate with or to undermine, certain existing forms of identity production. Since identity is always about “who we are” and “what we do”, the ambiguous, complex and still unresolved relations between China and Taiwan today have made some Chinese audience members ambivalent towards Taiwan and its products. This study aims to develop a ‘relational’ perspective of Taiwan-and-China to identify the connection and contradiction between the two in terms of national identity and identity vis-à -vis music, so that the music listening experience can be rendered into a political experience. This shows that Taiwan’s popular music in China is a co-production, intertwined with both sides’ political practices. In that sense, music is powerful yet limited.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-42/42-01abs.pdf,42,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
Folk Religion and Memory Politics: Yanping Junwang Temple and the Construction of National Identity,Wei-Hua Chen,"the construction of nation, folk religion, memory politics, cultural economy","How might folk religion influence a nation's nation-building actions? How to incorporate folk religion into national construction research to complement research on contemporary national identity in Taiwan? Taking Zheng Cheng-gong enshrined in the Yanping Junwang Temple as an example, this paper discusses the relationship between folk religion and national construction from the perspective of memory politics, focusing on historical narratives. From the Qing Dynasty to Japanese rule, the Kuomintang government to the DPP government, the historical narrative related to Zheng Cheng-gong is an important link in the construction of the regime and nation in successive dynasties. The state's narrative reconstruction of Zheng Cheng-gong must to gain public recognition. Only three elements that affect the spiritual power and legitimacy of gods, such as the edict, the righteous deeds during his lifetime, and the narrative of miracles, can achieve the expected political effect. After the wave of localization emerged in Taiwanese society, historical sites and landscapes have become destinations for the cultural tourism industry under globalization, and capitalist business logic such as “monopoly rent” has begun to become involved in Zheng Cheng-gong’s historical narrative construction. This article describes how Zheng Cheng-gong, a key historical figure in Taiwan’s nation-building, has been influenced by national and cultural economy forces in addition to the folk religion itself.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-42/42-02abs.pdf,42,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
A Preliminary Study of the Residence Types of Mainlander Soldiers After Applying for Household Registration（1959-1968）,Kuang-chun Li,"Mainlander soldier, household registration, residence type, Chuan-Tsun, housing demand","Via an analysis of original data on population mobility status, this paper explores if variation exists in the residence type of Mainlander soldiers after applying for household registration in the years between 1959 and 1968. First, the original data of immigrants/not reported and emigrants/ not reported in population mobility status across the 21 prefectures and cities of Taiwan are collected. Second, the accumulated difference between the above-mentioned two categories in each prefecture or city is calculated and transformed into a ratio structure corresponding to the weighted distribution of the 21 prefectures and cities in Taiwan. Third, on the basis of “the difference between registered population and expected population” provided by Executive Yuan in 1976, a revised estimation of the number of Mainlander soldiers applying for household registration in each of the 21 prefectures and cities is projected and compared to the increase in registered Chuan-Tsun households for the same period. It is found that the supply of Chuan-Tsun households was much less than the number of Mainlander soldiers across all the 21 prefectures and cities. It reminds us that Chuan-Tsun, as a housing institution, could not accommodate the lodging demands of Mainlander soldiers and their family members. Future attention should be given to the fact that the majority of Mainlander soldiers were on their own in finding a solution to their housing problem after applying for household registration, as well as the consequences, such as a variation in residence type.",https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/journal/ts-42/42-03abs.pdf,42,2021,Taiwanese Sociology
Queer Resistance in Popular Music: The Making of Dissident Voice in Hong Kong,Lucetta Y. L. KAM,"Anthony Wong, Creative Protest, Queer, Denise Ho, Hong Kong Popular Music","Hong Kong after 1997 has been marked by waves of pro-democracy movements. Among them, the Umbrella Movement in 2014 is understood to be one of the most significant protests. It signifies a shift of paradigm in the form and content of social movement. Being a territory-wide occupy movement led mainly by the younger generations, it is internationally well-known of its spectacular visual demonstrations, street art displays, protest music and the involvement of popular culture such as ACG fan communities. In the summer of 2019, Hong Kong has ex-perienced another major protest, the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement. In this article, I intend to narrate a (queer) story of Hong Kong during the period between these two major social movements through the creative participation of two openly gay and lesbian Canto-pop singers, Anthony Wong and Denise Ho. This article aims at (1) making visible the experiences of tongzhi/queer people in the pro-democracy protests; (2) exploring the various ways tongzhi/queer singers used to open up spaces of dissident voices. It is hoped that through the lens of queer people and queer artists' participation in the civil society and pro-democracy movements, we can put gender and sexuality back to the study of Hong Kong social movements, and to understand the role of popular music in pro-democratic movements. In particular, how popular music has gradually transformed to be a tactic used by the people to connect, act up and develop a sense of community in the post-2019 Hong Kong.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202210-202211070002-202211070002-29-48,35,2022,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

"Cut-out: Materiality, Infrastructure, and Subcultural Imaginary",Zhongwei LI,"1990s China, Music studies, Subculture, Materiality, Infrastructure","This article explores the possibility of music studies without a focus on 'music itself ', using a 'thing-centred' approach to investigate the music subculture of the 'cut-out generation' in 1990s mainland China. Seeking to demonstrate the relationship between the materiality of the cut-outs and the subcultural imaginary of the 'cut-out generation', it approaches the cut-out subculture with three main foci: the 'thingness' of the cut-outs as scrap materials, the defective materiality of the cut-outs as music records, and the infrastructure of cut-out retail business. After a brief introduction to the history of the cut-outs and the ＂cut-out generation＂, the first section studies the scrap business at the top of Chinese cutout industry and the rules by which the cut-outs were evaluated in this regime of value. The second section investigates the cut-outs' trajectory from a ＂thing＂ to an ＂object＂ with unique (sub)cultural use and meanings, focusing on the ＂typology of physical conditions＂ on the cut-out market and the ritual of ＂cut-out repairing＂ practiced by local consumers. The third section examines three types of cut-out retail outlets: ground stalls, rented counters in public marketplaces, and record stores, arriving at a peculiar ＂poetics＂ of the cut-out retail infrastructure marked by its ＂shabbiness＂ and ＂primitiveness＂ and the subtle political tensions embedded in the Post-Tiananmen context. The article concludes by arguing that the materiality and ＂musicness＂ of the cut-outs were mutually dependent on and conditioned by each other, and they joined together in articulating an affective response by the ＂cut-out generation＂ to the time they lived in.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202210-202211070002-202211070002-81-120,35,2022,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Such spaces facilitated the institutionalization of rock music culture in the Taiwanese society. However, such a process is still seriously understudied, despite relevant organizational characteristics are still playing key roles in regulating the recruitment of young people to the rock scene and how they learn to engage in musical activities up to the present day. Drawing on the data collected through interviews, archive research, and ethnography from the insiders' perspective, this paper aims to present the social contour of the rock scene at this phase and the impacts of relevant organizations on the development of rock culture in Taiwan. Inspired by the scene perspective in cultural studies, this paper contends that the historical background of the development of the popular music scene in the 1970s prepared the local condition for the redevelopment of the rock scene after the 1980s. That is to say, in the absence of performing opportunities and live venues, music shops, Yamaha band contests, available musical careers, and school extracurricular clubs constituted the main platforms that shaped how rock music culture evolved after the 1980s. Drawing on Howard Becker's theory of art worlds, I further illustrate how the organizational operation of these institutional platforms facilitated a series of musical conventions and a learning paradigm that defines the legitimate ways of playing rock instruments. Prima facie, the music scene depicted in this paper may seem less relevant to the rock culture in the present day-as characterized by the growing influence of indie music. However, the ethnographic findings in my study suggest that, through the operation of the pedagogical system composed of the music shops and school rock clubs at the very root level, this 'historical scene' has left a long-lasting legacy that still exerts substantial influences on young people's taste formation and musical practices, constituting an essential part of what makes Taiwanese rock culture unique and distinct from the other regions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202210-202211070002-202211070002-191-230,35,2022,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Cultural Governance and Its Discontents: The Urban Movement of Xinzhuang Street,"Liang-Yi YEN, Geng-Rong CHANG","Spatial consciousness, Cultural heritage, Urban governance, Neoliberalism, Right to the city","Cultural governance is one of the most important devices for municipal governments to govern their territories in order to achieve the goals of economic development or political stability. However, in the context of neoliberal urbanization, cultural governance usually causes various social problems, such as gentrification, eviction, unequal distribution of public resources, and therefore triggers urban movements that question urban policies. The purpose of this study is to understand the mechanism that produce such movements and their influences on cultural governance led by neo-liberalism. Looking at the case of Xinzhunag Street in New Taipei City, this study explores the urban policies being initiated by local government since the late 1990s, the impacts these policies had on civil society, and how civil society had engaged or intervened in the implementation of these policies. By observing, engaging, and reflecting on the urban movement of Xinzhuang Street, the authors analyze the structural factors that affected the formation of policies, the way that the actors' spatial consciousness is raised, the process of the conflicts and negotiations around urban renewal, and the political and social impacts of the urban movement.

Re-Deploying Hamasen/Hámásing/Hamaxing: Vernacular Preservation and the History on Site,Ching-wen HSU,"Cultural heritage, Right to the city, Urban governance","The article explores the politics of urban space by investigating the redevelopment of the seaside neighborhood Hamasing and the way citizen groups, heritage practices, and everyday life intersect in a changing landscape. Specifically, I am interested in how local efforts to preserve vernacular architecture intersect with the official program of ＂Regeneration of Historic Site,＂ a state-wide project that integrates historic preservation with urban governance and encompasses cross-departmental planning in collaboration with civic organizations. Controversies over the preservation of a street block drew public attention to Hamasing's history and its Japanese-era architectures. As the city pushes for more development on the coast, older buildings are constantly under threat of being demolished. However, Hamasing's old-time charm and its connection to the growth of Kaohsiung under Japan also plays a role in the city's self-fashioning as the harbinger of Taiwan's modernization. Hamasing's growing popularity attracts businesses that seek to capitalize on its proximity to other tourist attractions and the allure of old houses. This paper aims to understand the following questions: How has Hamasing's built environment resulting from Japan's colonial expansion and the city's postindustrial transformation become reconfigured and envisioned to generate different kinds of connections? How, as vernacular architecture became incorporated into official endeavor to produce an integrated historic landscape, do local preservationists navigate institutional constrains, market forces, and policy changes while at the same time contributing to these shifting frameworks? How unofficial, local, and vernacular endeavors to identify, define, and preserve common heritage contribute to the formulation of alternative interpretations of city life and mobilizing actions for the future?",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202204-202205060006-202205060006-67-108,34,2022,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Alternative Historical Writing: Nonuments of the International Sixth Fuel Factory Interactive Theater,Wen-Shu LAI,"Participatory interactive theater, History, Memory, Monument, Interrogative design, Historical writing","Taiwan was enmeshed in the Second World War as a Japanese colony. However, no monument of the war has been erected in Taiwan, and Taiwan-centered discourses about the war remain under construction since the end of the war. Therefore, when advancing the proposition to ＂regenerate the historic site＂ of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Sixth Fuel Factory, Hsinchu Branch, we should carefully tackle the questions regarding whose history and site it actually is within the historical context of the factory. Only by doing so can we attach substantial, root-taking significance to the Ministry of Culture's Regeneration of Historic Sites Project. Nonuments, the Sixth Fuel Factory interactive theater, was staged on the basis of these questions. The discourses of this paper center on the theoretical propositions, praxis and rethinking of Nonuments. Using this theater as the text of research and treating the IoTtalk voting system that engaged the viewers in the multi-media historical writing as the point of departure, this paper seeks to investigate if the viewers' collective participation in designing the monument of the Second World War simultaneously galvanized them into alternative historical writing. To deal with this issue, this paper adopts a seven-pronged strategy, including ＂semantic lacuna＂, ＂interrogative monument＂, ＂history, memory and forgetting＂, ＂plot and question design＂, ＂real-time data computation cloud＂, ＂thinking as the other＂, and ＂intersubjective dialogue＂, through which the development and connotation of alternative historical writing can be analytically discussed. Furthermore, this article intended to discuss how Nonuments uses the theater as the medium, the making of monuments as the content of the work, and the historical scene as the performing space.

It is also regarded as an important indicator for the progress of decolonization and the integration of ethnic spirit. This paper highlights the mopped-up histories and memories of the Atayal people in the front mountain of Jianshi, Hsinchu, more than 110 years ago. In face of this issue, historical textual analysis helps the interpretation of the news regarding the assault of the Atayal people in Hsinchu reported by Taiwan Daily News. It shows how the policy of the Japanese police guard-line suppressed, differentiated and offered amnesty for the tribes. Theoretical discussion of the politics of memories informs us why landscape renovation was able to lighten up memories of struggles and guided the indigenous people to gradually adapt themselves to the realities of colonization-the mountains were nationalized and the assimilation policy had started. The paper analyzes these aspects in the following steps: First, it examines the background and process of the officially established tourist attraction ＂cherry blossoms of the Neihengping Mountain.＂ Second, this paper scrutinizes the process through which the meaning of the cherry blossoms in the Cherry Blossom Mountain was given and spread. That is, it explores how the Japanese colonial government deconstructed the memories of the bloodshed region by recreating a tourist attraction in it. Third, it contextualizes the news coverage of the assault in Taiwan Daily News and collects the responses of Mekarang and other tribes to offer a counter perspective. Fourth, it analyzes the identification divergence between the multiethnic communities formed in Mekarang alert area, the people in Mekarang tribes and the officials after 1917. Fifth, it investigates the fragmented memories of the resistance against the police guard-line by the locals in Meihua Village and their contemporary significance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202204-202205060006-202205060006-149-187,34,2022,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Later, Japanese scholars transformed ＂contents tourism＂ into a conceptual framework covering the tourism phenomena related the popular culture, and promote it as a general framework in the international academia, in anthropology and sociology in particular. Yamamura Takayoshi, one of the leading theorists of ＂contents tourism＂, proposes a ＂three parties interactive framework＂ for scrutinizing the interaction between the local society, the audience/tourist, and the copyright holder. He considers Taiwan as one of the major foreign examples to prove that the framework can be applied internationally. This article serves as a demonstration of the conceptual developments and multiple approaches toward pilgrimage and contents tourism, and to introduce this concept in Chinese.

How did the Japanese secret service monitor their cultural activities in Manchukuo? How did the Manchus view these activities within a situation in which they saw the Republican government as their enemy, when they were ruled by the Japanese? The different modes of spatial knowledge these historical actors have employed in narrating the borders of culture and geography have expanded our horizon of this time/space of conflict. This paper explores Chinese young people's anti-Japanese activities in Manchukuo, based on the materials donated by renowned Chinese writer Ji Gang (紀剛). Ji Gang participated in these activities under the cover of a medical student, and described them in his well-received non-fiction book Rolling Liao River (Gungun liaohe 滾滾遼河). The paper focuses in particular on the Japanese secret police's reports, donated by Ji Gang to the Tsing Hua University Library, that analyze the anti-Japanese content of Chinese literary works. These reports can be described as the hidden transcripts, in terms of James C. Scott's definition. However, Scott's work on domination and resistance is framed within a dichotomy of dominator/dominated.

The Gamification of the Narrative of Locality: Example of the MOD of ＂Republican Warriors＂,Kwok Wai LAI,"Umbrella Movement, Local Discourse, Digitalized Locality, Hong Kongness, Gamification","'Gamification' has become an important concept in the fields of digital media and digital marketing. It used to refer to implant some game elements to nongame activities, to achieve some objectives beyond playing or gaming. Some critics pointed out that the concept of 'gamification' has already penetrated into many different aspects of our lives. This paper would like to show how 'gamification' is also used in the writing of history. In other words, for some cases discussed in this paper, we could see the 'gamification' of historical narrative. It is no doubt that there are plenty of electronic or video games in the game market that take history as their main theme. However, the game(s) discussed in this paper, 'Republican Warriors' (and its derivative works), were not made for profit-making, but for sharing. It only asked for donation from the gamers. It opened its own 'Modification' (MOD), which allows the gamers to modify or even create their own games. This paper picked two modified games as example and discuss how modified games could become an important 'carrier' of locality. In other words, this paper would like to discuss the following question: how the Hong Kong people using digital technology to gamify the local discourse through the format of '(quasi-)historical narrative', in other words, making digital texts as a carrier of 'digitalized locality' or digitalized Hong Kongness, continuing the construction and modification of the 'third wave of local consciousness' from offline society to online community?",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202110-202111050005-202111050005-237-284,33,2021,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

At the early stage of television development, approximately 40% of television programs in Taiwan were imported from the U.S. Among them, situation comedies were popular and widely discussed for their fascinating new formats and the modern lifestyle they represented through the images of housewives. However, certain debates arose as television intrigued the public with novelty, especially the situation comedies were considered too hilarious for a war-torn state. In the discussions of American comedy, I Love Lucy routed the cultural elites to come to terms with their defeated memories in 1949's Mainland China, and to re-evaluate the new American style of humor. They discussed if it was proper to laugh in a tragic time, as well as how to contain such affects and sensations of TV experiences in the Cold War era.

"Polemic, Reality and Chinese Malayan Revolutionary Literature: Jin Zhimang and His Practice of ＂Here and Now＂",Show Ying Xin,"Realism, Malayan Communist Party, Cold War, Jin Zhimang, Uniqueness of Chinese Malayan literature, Mahua revolutionary literature","The 1947-1948 literary polemic on the ＂uniqueness of Mahua (Chinese Malayan) literature＂ is often seen as a watershed to the establishment of local consciousness among Mahua writers, and the contents are repeatedly called upon by critics in different historical times. The debates have since set the tone for two major propositions in Mahua literature: firstly, the relationship between localism and Chineseness, namely the problems of identity and belongings of Mahua writers and their works; secondly, the significance of literary realism (as opposed to modernism), which concerns the role of aesthetics and politics in literature. Critics often regard the above issues in rather binary frameworks, and this article argues that revisiting the literary practice of Jin Zhimang, the key proponent of the ＂Mahua＂ camp during the debate, would help overcome the binary caused by the Cold War. The article seeks to understand the contextual formation and meaning of Mahua revolutionary literature. As a partisan writer from the Malayan Communist Party, Jin Zhimang's works are not only a testimony to revolution but also a practice of ＂literature as revolution＂. Nevertheless, while he was loyal to the writing techniques required by revolutionary literature, he also made efforts to transcend the boundaries and functions of revolutionary narratives. This article addresses the inherent rebellious and pertinacious nature of Jin's revolutionary literature through the analysis of his novella Tok Yang Yang and His tribe (1954) and novel Hunger (1960). It argues that the function of Mahua revolutionary literature is not merely about reflecting objectively the ＂here and now＂, but goes further to recognize that as prefiguring the ＂future＂.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202104-202108050002-202108050002-9-46,32,2021,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Intervention and the Impact of the Cold War in Malay and Chinese Malaysian Literature (1950-1969),Chong Fah Hing,"Polemic, Cold War, Chinese Malaysian literature, Malay literature, Cultural thought struggle","The end of the Pacific War witnessed the decline of the British Empire in Singapore and Malaya. It had evoked the aspiration of the local peoples to establish a newly independent nation. Furthermore, the rise of the Chinese Communist Party had led to the Chinese community in Nanyang split into pro Communist and pro Nationalist factions. At this juncture, the Malay ethnic was putting their effort in pursuing a new nation through nationalism ideas and thoughts. With the contestation of various forces, the British colonial was forced to hand-over the power to the right-wing elements of various ethnic groups in order to protect its economic interests in the colony. From the leftist point of view, this was perceived as a move of neo-colonization, therefore they turned to arm struggle again. In 1949, United States began to realize the importance of Southeast Asia to its material supply and strategic planning in the region. The shifting of the Cold War to Southeast Asia eventually led to the confrontation and contestation between the left and right ideology. This situation had brought a profound impact to the Malay and the Chinese literary circle in the country. The impacts of the Indonesian independence movement in the early 1950s had triggered the establishment of a left-leaning literary organization in Malay literary circle, namely ＂The 1950s Writers Group＂ (Angkatan Sasterawan 50). The intervention of the Cold War also had caused a cleavage within the writers of ASAS 50, and eventually led to the polemic over the slogan of ＂Art for society＂ or ＂Art for art sake＂. In the Chinese Malaysian literary arena, the newly published magazine in 1955, called Chao Foon proposed the slogan of ＂Pure Malayanization＂, and had created the contestation with the left-wing cultural community over the discourse. Later, a literary supplement called Yingsing also set off the polemic between socialism-realist and modernist writers. This article aims to clarify the cultural and ideological issues mentioned in the polemics in both literary streams, and try to understand how the intervention of the Cold War dominated the direction of the polemic, and how it shaped the trajectory of the development of the Malay as well as Chinese Malaysian literature.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202104-202108050002-202108050002-47-72,32,2021,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

The Shenzhou Poetry Society which has been regarded as a ＂myth＂ has a strong cultural awareness. It aimed to re-construct the ＂Cultural China＂ and reviving the ＂Chinese Culture＂. And thus they intended to build up a ＂classical China＂ in Taiwan. Unfortunately, some of the members of Shenzhou Poetry Society were expelled from Taiwan because of the political environment that was unkind to their vision and led to the imprisonment of several members. This is a crucial turning point for the poetry society, as it led to the end of its activities. Shenzhou Poetry Society had published many literary works in Taiwan. The members have established close relationship with Taiwan's literary society. Therefore, this paper attempts to sort out the reactions and responses of Shenzhou Poetry Society of the ＂Home Soil Literary Debate＂ in Taiwan. Although the society did not directly participate in the discussion, its relationship with the debate was rather circuitous.

Speculation Beyond Technological Mediation Theory: A Case Study on Morse Things as a Thing-Centered Design,"Wan-Chen LEE, Rung-Huei LIANG","Withdrawal, Thing-centered, Interobjectivity, Technological mediation, Object-oriented ontology","Morse Things, as an interaction design, applied a thing-centered approach to exploring insights from a thing-centered perspective. The work not just practiced the creative notion of material speculation, but also inquired into the gap between things and human. Ron Wakkary et al. argue that interaction designers can ＂do postphenomenology＂ by the withdrawn experience from our human understanding and perception, but they ignore that the theory inherits the epistemological approach based on human value from phenomenology, and focuses on exploring the lifeworld. Different from this inherent contradiction, the theory of Object-Oriented Ontology has accepted Quentin Meillassoux's critique of correlationism, it reminds us that ＂withdrawal＂ originates from the inherent characteristics of the thing-in-itself. Although the concept of technological mediation can be helpful in investigating and analyzing the human-technology-world relations, it cannot indicate the invisible interobjectivity between things, which presents more creative speculative thinking. This paper, discussing Morse Things as a case, covers three main aspects. First, we investigate the thing-centered design approach by asking whether it matches the epistemic stance of the third paradigm, and can be analyzed through postphenomenology. Second, what is the relevant theoretical context in which the ＂withdrawal＂ concept can be applied to the work? Does it echo the essence of the work? Finally, how does the work go beyond the technical mediation theory, make dialogue with the concepts of ＂withdrawal＂, and speculate on the possibility of different interaction experience? Through understanding about ＂withdrawal＂, we rethink the relationship between thing-centered design and postphenomenology, and how the object-oriented vision enriches the human-centered design concepts, towards exploring the experience of things, and gradually developing the theoretical research of thing-centered design.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202104-202108050002-202108050002-131-168,32,2021,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
From Tourist to Marriage Migrant: Intimacy and Lifestyle Imagination in Taiwan-Hong Kong Cross-border Marriages,"Tsung-Yi Michelle HUANG, Chun-Kai WOO","Tourist gaze, Holiday romance, Slow life, Hong Kong-Taiwan marriage migration, Lifestyle migration","This essay starts off from the romantic gaze of Hong Kong wives in Taiwan to analyze the connection between Taiwan tourism and their pursuit of personal aspiration and ideal life, as well as the sense of place and romantic love constructed through such gaze. In many instances Hong Kong wives point out that they come to love Taiwan's ＂slow living,＂ ＂small pleasures,＂ and ＂friendliness＂ when they are traveling in Taiwan, and their fond impression thus also lends them certain amount of trust and positivity towards Taiwanese men. The latter part of this essay then discusses the differences in their feeling towards Taiwan after these women married to Taiwan, turning from ＂traveling＂ to ＂living.＂ The imagined life shaped by tourism and holiday romance prompts these Hong Kong women to anticipate its realization when they immigrate to Taiwan through transborder marriage. However, after they take residence in Taiwan, the actuality of life nevertheless meets such anticipation with disenchantment. In various interviews, the interviewees invariably note the discrepancy between traveling and living in Taiwan. At the same time, the glamour of ＂slow living＂ gradually wears off and the taste of ＂friendliness＂ starts to go sour. Facing such a downward spiral, some interviewees emphasize the importance of taking up the challenges of fitting in the workplace and getting along with the in-laws; some start to run blogs, Facebook fan pages, or other forms of cultural and creative jobs, in an attempt to maintain their tourist gaze. By analyzing Hong Kong wives' experience of marrying to Taiwan, this paper argues that their settlement is marked by the continued negotiation between disenchantment and re-enchantment of their tourist gaze.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202104-202108050002-202108050002-169-210,32,2021,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Configuring Sustainable Lifestyle in Alternative Food Networks from the Perspective of Practice Theory,I-Liang WAHN,"Consumer community, Sustainable consumption, Practices, Alternative Food Networks","Farmers markets, consumer cooperatives, and community supported agriculture are examples of alternative food networks (AFNs) that promote organic and local foods to consumers. This paper uses practice theory to understand how AFNs shape food consumption. The case of Eco-Tree Hub created by the first farmer's market in Taiwan is used to illustrate how a consumer community can reconfigure elements of buying, cooking and eating practices and connect food practices to other daily practices such as the use of reusable shopping bags and utensils. The paper makes the argument that AFN's agrifood education allows consumers to play an active role in framing food qualities. Moreover, the consumer community in AFN provided a social space of performance, using food qualities as the sharing element to connect a variety of practices into practice bundles. The consumer community also serve as a supporting network that enable consumers to influence and coordinate with their family members to re-organize daily life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202104-202108050002-202108050002-211-254,32,2021,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Mrs. Pants' Modes of Life: Queer Temporalities and Reparative Turn in Troublers and Small Talk,Pei-Jean CHEN,"Precariousness, Reparative reading, Sexual politics, Queer modes of life, Troublers, Small Talk","Focusing on the main figures of Yi Muk and T Mama in recent queer documentaries: Troublers (2015) and Small Talk (2016) produced by South Korean and Taiwanese independent directors, this paper speaks to recent work in queer theory and historiography on the potential for ＂queer modes of life＂. Yi Muk and T Mama were born and lived in South Korea and Taiwan during the 1945-1970s, when the two societies were undergoing drastic political and economic transformations: from Japanese colonialism, the Cold War system, to the authoritarian regimes, as well as the peak period of the economic development and industrialization. Against this backdrop, the two protagonists demonstrate a critical lived experience of precariousness in terms of gender/sexuality and labor work. I argue the ＂precarious memory＂ embodied in the documentaries present a useful analytical framework for examining the dominant mode of history writing. To facilitate this argument, I will trace the shifting paradigms of sexual norms from the legacy of colonialism, the cold war ideology, to the precarious present when the knowledge production of sexuality is passed on to subsequent generations. To be more specific, I will discuss the issues of gender norms through the reading of the liminal subjects of pajissi and chhēng-khò-ê (both means Mrs. Pants in Korean and Taiwanese language), the precarious lives of these non-normative subjects under cold war system, and how the directors (as subsequent generations of Yi Muk and T Mama) integrate this socio-history into the present and future, to approach a reparative reading of queer history.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202010-202011170001-202011170001-7-42,31,2020,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Queer Latent Images, Post-loyalism and the Cold War: The Case of an Early Sinophone Star, Bai Yun",Wai-Siam HEE,"Sinophone, Cold War, Post-loyalist, Queer, Dashing young scholar, Chineseness","This essay sets the career of early Sinophone star Bai Yun (1916-1982) in its Second Sino-Japanese War to Cold War context, using materials from early newspapers, magazines, film, Bai Yun's own writings, and memoirs to analyze his alternative queer latent images and Chineseness. The essay uses a post-loyalist perspective to examine Malaya-born Bai Yun's diaspora experience, which spanned Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. It discusses Bai Yun's various displaced and decadent diaspora experiences as a post-loyalist Chinese, and explores how his amorous exploits upturned the upright orthodoxy of modern Chinese nationalism. Bai Yun's ＂girlish＂ pin-up star image, queer latent images, and amorous history challenged the hegemony of masculinity and homogeneity within Chinese Nationalism. The essay also applies star theory to analyze Bai Yun's career and reverse publicity methods, examining the formation of Bai Yun as a consumption phenomenon in the early Sinophone cultural sphere. On screen, he performed with the stylings of a traditional Chinese feminine dashing young scholar; off screen, he frequently created scandals involving other male and female stars as part of a reverse publicity strategy. This called up and constructed an on-screen persona with a queer latent image. While he successfully attracted controversy and the gaze of the audience, he also enraged the nationalist patriarchal socio-cultural order that the modern media of the KMT and CCP wished to maintain. His case subverts the primary-subordinate relationship of ＂roots＂ and ＂routes＂ as seen in diaspora Chinese discourse, embodying how the needs, dreams, and collective unconscious of early Sinophone audiences were encoded, mediated, or repressed by Chinese Nationalism and the various ideologies of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the Cold War.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202010-202011170001-202011170001-43-82,31,2020,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Ten Years and the Politics of Emotion in Post-Umbrella Hong Kong,Sam Lok-man MAK,"Emotion, Hong Kong cinema, Emotion management, Umbrella Movement","Ten Years is a cinema project that projected imaginaries towards Hong Kong's near future. As the film engaged with sensitive political issues, it was boycotted by most of the commercial distributors in Hong Kong. However, the marginal circulation circuits marked its distinctiveness as a unique event of Hong Kong cinema. Under the intensifying political tensions, the cinemas suddenly suspended the screening of Ten Years even it had reached a surprising box office record. The team then switched to an alternative way to circulate the film by organizing community screenings with NGOs. While the film is marginalized from the mainstream distribution channels, it received ＂the best movie＂ prize from the 35th Hong Kong Film Awards which is a quasi-official institution of recognition of the Hong Kong cinema. However, once Ten Years' nomination was announced, Huanqiu Times, an official media of PRC, accused the directors of ＂disseminating despairs＂ and ＂spreading anxiety around the city.＂ Surprisingly some ＂progressive＂ critics also resonated with such negative view over the ＂emotional＂ aspect of the texts. This paradox points toward a new path for critical intervention: the politics of emotions. On one hand, Ten Years serves as a medium of emotions that circulated around the society; on the other hand, discourses had been generated through the text's circulation across various fields and social institutions. Such a process also played a significant role in the production of emotions. Resistance and negotiation in this process opened up spaces for investigation of the current conjuncture of Hong Kong. As a new approach to articulate the cultural politics of ＂post-Umbrella Movement,＂ inspired from Sara Ahmed, Raymond Williams and Wendy Brown's theoretical thinking on emotions, this paper first reconstructed the context of the circulation and then deploy textual analysis of the emotions of Ten Years.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202010-202011170001-202011170001-115-150,31,2020,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Scattered Isles and Fragmented Genealogy: On a ＂History of the Rest＂ for Radical Art Practices in Taiwan,Hsiang-Pin WU,"Politics of aesthetics, Residuum, Weak institution, Limits of writing, Radical art practices in Taiwan","In the History of Art in Taiwan, Taiwanese artists develop in a unique way the radicality of their art practices which are deeply inspired by North-American and West-European Avant-garde. In fact, this artistic radicality is also built on its resistance to oppression by the different colonial regimes, to exploitation by the neoliberalism, and to the current global crisis in the collapse of capitalism. However, the radical art practices in Taiwan are often confronted by the reactions coming from the political sphere. And in this situation of confrontation or even contradiction between art and politics, the force of resistance generated by radical art practices turns out to be suspended in a state of the ＂rest＂. If this state of the ＂rest＂ is the very place where artists create their force of resistance at the limits between different spheres of life, and develop a new mode of production to temporarily flee from the absorption by capitalism, will the ＂rest＂ be instantly alienated and dissolved when radical art practices are subjected, on the one hand, to the system of representation in the exhibition, and on the other hand, to the system of interpretation in the History? And if the history writing is an inevitable way to capture the traces of the ＂rest＂ in radical art practices, would it be possible to write an ＂history of the rest＂ and escape at the same time from the taming of the History? This article will develop different approaches to these questions not only with Paul Mann's criticism on the ＂rest＂ and Jacques Ranciere's aesthetic and historiography theory, but also with the artist collectives like Taiwan Archives, Open Circle Tribe, and MIGA.

Staging Embodiment and Senses in the Museum: A Proposal,"Shih CHANG, Yu-Ting CHEN","Singapore, Taiwan, Research methods, Body and senses, Museum exhibition","Why do museums need to pay attention to embodiment and sensorial studies? Modern museums and their exhibitions are visually oriented and are often positioned as a space where one is not supposed to indulge one's ＂lower＂ senses. However, human experience and social memory are produced and reproduced through sensory and bodily engagements, which are crucial carriers of material culture and its social meanings, and therefore have the potential to preserve cultural heritage in dynamic ways. Using the concepts of ＂situated knowledge＂ and ＂sensory ethnography＂, this paper discusses how sensorial and bodily elements are utilized in museum spaces through two case studies: Singapore Art Museum and the National Taiwan Museum of Prehistoric Culture. This paper points out that museum exhibitions which demonstrate sensorial and embodiment elements are able to produce dynamic contents and tell versatile stories. Placing emphasis on perception and body memory, these exhibitions are therefore able to transcend visually-based material culture research and provide meta-theories for museum studies. At the same time, by preserving and representing non-visual cultural heritage, these exhibitions show how sensory embodied knowledge can transmit between person and generations through the visitors' sensorial and material engagement in the exhibitions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-202004-202005130002-202005130002-37-67,30,2020,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

The author first summarizes criticism centering on cultural strategies paralleling the development of Taiwan: critics have discussed the effects of community buildings, historic preservation, performative festivals, creative cities and so on to propose that they actually embody state control, class ruling, the liability of capital to pursue greater profit, cultures that gradually lose their glamour, and the environmental crisis. Against these problems, critics have also envisioned cultural resistance. The author then shows the framing ideas local scholars have adopted so far to explore these cultural strategies of development. These include the living sphere of culture, cultural planning, creative clusters, creative cities and cultural governance, ideas that are connected to a network of knowledge constituted by three academic institutions which hold different positions yet have mutual exchanges. After discussing their respective theoretical connection and concerns regarding practices, the author concludes that an analysis as well as a reconstruction of the support network for cultural life should be pivotal, and should therefore be considered as the next agenda of research and practices.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201912-202001300016-202001300016-13-62,29,2019,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Beyond Postcolonial Imagination and Subaltern Studies as Critical Theory,Allen CHUN,"Governmentality, Subaltern studies, Eurocentrism, Postcolonialism, Cultural critique, Social theory","This paper is an analysis and critique of two genres of postcolonial cultural critique. On the one hand, so-called postcolonial theory has sparked heated debate in the literature. I argue that many problems are caused by contradictions in definition; in different disciplinary contexts, they have created incompatible conceptual mindsets. On the other hand, subaltern studies is rooted in a different concrete historical context and theoretical framework, thus at the same time creating a different kind of problematic. Through a critical reassessment of these different but related postcolonialisms and their interdisciplinary influence, this paper will emphasize the collusive relationship between knowledge and its field of practice in order to deconstruct the operation of colonial cultural power. Yet the object of critical gazing for both is still Eurocentric theoretical authority or its historical prevalence, thus in principle can ultimately be viewed within the same frame of analysis.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201912-202001300016-202001300016-101-122,29,2019,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"The Liminality of Decolonization, De-Cold War and Deimperialization: Boal's Newspaper Theater and East Asian Popular Culture as Method in Drama Box's Community Commedia Dell'Arte News Busters!",How Wee NG,"Drama Box, East Asian popular culture, Theater of the Oppressed, Newspaper theater, Commedia dell'Arte, Singapore theater","The research on Singapore Chinese theater has largely focused on the study of theater groups, productions and/or practitioners within fixed historical timelines. There exists a gap in the consideration of how socially engaged Chinese theater in contemporary Singapore can potentially contribute to the discourse on decolonization, de-Cold War and de-imperialization. This paper examines Drama Box, one of Singapore's most prolific theater companies, known for its socially engaging Mandarin productions and community theater. Drawing from Chen Kuan-hsing's ＂Asia as method＂, I consider the theater group's cultural practice in relation to the state's ongoing project for developing Singapore into ＂a global city for the arts,＂ the official framework of multiculturalism which draws from British colonial legacies, and the post-Cold War milieu for using Mandarin as a medium for political critique and social engagement in Singapore where English is an official working language. Focusing on the 2007 production of News Busters!, Drama Box's Mandarin community comedy theater series touring in different government housing estates and inspired by the farcical and satirical conventions of Commedia dell'Arte, I analyze how it appropriates Augusto Boal's newstheater techniques and East Asian popular culture genres and motifs for sociopolitical critique. Paying particular attention to the performance at Kreta Ayer Square, I examine the sociopolitical significance of its satire in an open civil space located in the late Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's constituency. This is a play that has satirized the Singapore General Election in 2006, questioned the government's rationale for high ministerial salaries, meritocracy and elitism, and reflected on the political apathy, conservatism and myopia of voters. While the cultural intervention of News Busters! potentially contributes to decolonization, de-Cold War and de-imperialization, its liminality lies in Drama Box's multifaceted relationship with the state, which is simultaneously collaborative and oppositional. Such an understanding problematizes binarized thinking, as proposed by ＂Asia-as-method＂.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201912-202001300016-202001300016-123-160,29,2019,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

After comparing Japan's late Edo period (1603-1867) and the Taisho period (1912-1926), and the rural population movements occurred in both Japan and Taiwan in the 1960s, this paper finds that under different social atmospheres and conditions, the preference of the homesickness songs (Boukyou Enka) for those social marginals were significantly different in Japan and Taiwan. In order to present their own situation, Tai-wanese people localized the subject when covering the genre of Japanese homesickness songs. It also extended to cover the Japanese Wandering Knight-errant tale songs (Mata Tabimono Enka) which often took the late Edo period as the historical stage and echoed the social situation of Taiwan in the 1960s. The two types of song genre merged through the stories of the misfortune in reflecting the backwardness of Taiwan's indus-trialization process and the distress of the political environment. In the 1960s, Taiwan and Japan took a path of high economic growth, but the scars imprinted during the postwar era were very different.

This paper points out that Long Ying-Zong has shaped a new modern individual subject generated from colonial capitalism. This new modern individual subject has the characteristics of ＂economic individualism＂ and believes that individuals are the owners of themselves and their abilities and can gain benefits and develop upward with their own efforts. However, in the colonial environment, this new modern individual subject appeared with a broken mark.

Tanigawa said: ＂If you do not subvert the reflection of the world, you will never be able to subvert the reality. Start with the image.＂ This proposition is his tactics. It is to subvert the existing framework, to summon the imagination of new possibilities, and wage revolutionary wars at the ideological level. In his thoughts, people are an energy field of both reactionary and revolutionary motives. In the depth of ＂heretical people,＂ there is an ＂Origin＂ as the cathode of revolution (relative to the anode as represented by vanguard party or intelligentsia).

Homelands of refugees are the places wherein their cultures take root. Because of being forced to take shelter in neighboring countries, refugees are perceived as people severing their ties with their cultures and loose the cosmology. However, in the Karen refugee camps at the Thai- Burma border, thanks to Thai authorities' border and refugee management policies, as well as international humanitarian assistance, the Karen refugees rebuild their culture in refugee camps. The rebuilt culture is called displaced societal culture. Within the societal culture, a simultaneity emerges and all members in refugee camps can thus inherit their collective memory. The existence of the societal culture is the reason why a nation can be objectively perceived and recognized, as well as the critical factor that nationalists can make use to mobilize ordinary people's nationalist consciousness.

Exiled Tibetans developed ＂Tibetanness＂ because they are refugees with responsibility to preserve Tibetan culture and tradition. ＂Tibetanness＂ has been derived from political identity, shaping exiled Tibetan's survival strategies and economic practice. Winter sweater-selling business in India and Tibetan carpet industry in Nepal are two cases to demonstrate how exiled Tibetans exercise their ＂Tibetanness＂ in the refugee economy.

"Mobility, Bordering, and the Contested Localness of the Tea Trade between Taiwan and Vietnam","Po-Yi HUNG, Yu-Hsiu LIEN","Materiality, Mobility, Vietnamese tea, Border, Assemblage, Taiwanese tea","Taking tea trade between Vietnam and Taiwan as an example, this essay aims to reconsider the re-localization of agro-food production and consumption through understanding the politics of (de)bordering and (im)mobilization in local food system (LFS). Starting from the early 1990s, a group of Taiwanese entrepreneurs and tea merchants started their tea plantations and production in Vietnam, especially in the Province of Lam Dong. Instead of using the tea trees that originally grew in Vietnam, these Taiwanese entrepreneurs and tea merchants transplanted tea trees of improved varieties from Taiwan. Additionally, they also brought along the whole ＂package＂ of processing techniques. In other words, they believed they also produced Taiwanese tea, whereas the production location was in Vietnam instead. In Taiwan, the ＂local＂ production of tea has declined due to a variety of reasons. Nevertheless, the market demand of tea has increased mainly because of the increasing consumption of bottled teas, handmade tea drinks at chain stores, and the tea for touristic souvenirs. As a result, strong demand for imported tea, mainly from Vietnam, has increased to meet the growing consumption. However, the emerging ethos of LFS in Taiwan has created a discourse of local authenticity in agriculture, including tea production. In consequence, the decreasing local tea production in Taiwan has been labeled as the only authentic tea product of Taiwan. In accordance, many people regard Vietnamese tea, including those produced by Taiwanese tea entrepreneurs in Lam Dong, as a threat tarnishing the authenticity of local tea in Taiwan. Based on the empirical data collected in both Taiwan and Vietnam, we argue that the local food movement has been a circulation assemblage with an interface between border work and material mobility. From that, we problematize the emerging pursuit of a purified and essentialized local food, Taiwanese tea in particular.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201812-201903270002-201903270002-87-126,27,2018,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

"Domesticating Water, Domesticating Persons: The Face-saving Project and Technological Performance of Tap-water Drinking Programs in Taipei","Chih-Hung WANG, Jo-Tzu HUANG","Purification, Infrastructure, Modernity, Trust","This paper explores the tap-water drinking programs of the Taipei City and argues that they acted as face-saving project in a ＂latecomer anxiety＂ atmosphere and need technological performances to ensure trust from citizens. In the 1960s, the Taipei Water Department claimed that the tap-water in Taipei already reached potable water standards, but the turbidity of water was not convincing. In responding to the public’s questioning, the Department maintained that the water was turbid because the end-users had installed inadequate pipes. In the 1980s, the government again initiated the project, and made those sites featuring the face of the nation as their targets, such as schools and tourist hotels. At this stage the government highlighted the needs of replacing pipes directly linked to the end-users, and through counseling programs it aimed to cultivate the citizens as advanced drinking subjects. Tap-water drinking was also renamed as ＂secure drinking＂ given this context. Despite all the efforts, citizens still lacked confidence in the quality of the water. During the late-1990s, when the piped water system had been greatly improved, the government began setting up ＂purifier water supply machines＂ in public places. It also tried to demonstrate the reliability of the water by publicizing the water quality statistics. Yet given the public’s concerns with hygiene and personal tastes, people still use filter device before drinking tap-water. The authors argue that the case of tap-water drinking programs suggests that domestication of humans and water have to be carried out simultaneously; especially when water tends to become wild again even after domestication, the material aspect constituting the anxiety and reliability during the course of civilizing purification is made obvious.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201812-201903270002-201903270002-159-193,27,2018,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Dancing China ? : Exploring Artistic Creativity in the Nationalistic Dance under an Authoritarian Regime in Taiwan during the 1950s and 1960s,Wei-Ying HSU,"Ballet, Invented tradition, Authoritarian regime, Nationalistic dance, Cultural hegemony","Dance as a modern art form in Taiwan originated from the period of Japanese colonization, however, the cold war period of 1950s-1960s was a stage of transformation that institutionalized dance and formed the basis of the dance field as we know today. During this time, anti-communism and recovering Mainland China was the goal of the Nationalistic Government Kuomintang（KMT 國民黨）, hence cultural policies were formulated to achieve the goal and so was the policy of dance. The Chinese Nationalistic dance created in Taiwan so called minzu dance（民族舞蹈）was the product promoted by KMT and its aim was to legitimatize the authority of KMT based on cultural nationalism. Scholars who studied minzu dance emphasized its political demands and considered that the dance policy limited the creativity of choreographers. This research turns this assumption into a question. Instead of talking about how the creativity of choreographers were restricted by the dance policy, I analyze documents and literature to see how choreographers created minzu dance that was an invented tradition, and special attention is paid to Taiwanese choreographers who grew up during Japanese colonization and had little experience of Mainland China. By revealing how choreographers created minzu dance in terms of their mentalities, the techniques, the strategies, I argue that minzu dance was the product of the negotiations between dancers and politicians. However, it was the creativity and techniques in dance making rather than the policy seeking to shape it that determined how minzu dance was presented and perceived.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201807-201808130001-201808130001-9-58,26,2018,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

It retraces and examines the origins and development of Malaysian Bumiputera privileges in order to demonstrate that not only does this constitute the frontier of the Malaysian Chinese diaspora, but also constructs a Taiwan-resident Malaysian Chinese diaspora discourse, emblematized by author and critic Ng Kim Chew. This diaspora discourse excludes Malaysian Chinese localization discourse, and tends to create a theoretical link between localization and the ＂original homeland＂ myth of Bumiputera privileges. This article reflects on the difficulties and legitimacy of Malaysian Chinese localization, employing Sinophone theory to explore the ＂accented style＂ and the identity of local sensibility evident in the accented cinema Ice Kacang Puppy Love. When first screened, this film was not regarded by state film body FINAS as a domestic Malaysian film. Only after director Ah Niu took the Malaysian government to task over this on a Taiwanese arts show did opposition and governing parties unite to protest this, eventually winning the film recognition as a domestic production exempt from the entertainment tax. Ah Niu is firmly rooted in Malaysian soil, but also steps into Taiwan and other Chinese societies. His use of a diaspora or against diaspora position to criticize the Malaysian government and gain recognition is a process of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, illustrating the way in which diaspora and localization co-exist and thrive in Malaysian Chinese society. Ice Kacang Puppy Love’s descriptive framework for Chinese-Malay relations is not confined to standard ethnic templates, but creatively morphs into a criticism of Sinification discourse and the patriarchy. It also uses a Malaysian Chinese ＂accented style＂ and local music composition to create an identity of local sensibility, enabling fluid local-ness to transform into a local accent within a diaspora film: it can be brought across frontiers at will, resulting in the deterritorialization of the diaspora.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201807-201808130001-201808130001-59-96,26,2018,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
In the Name of ＂Tribe＂ : The Context and Debate on the Establishment of Indigenous Tribal Schools,Wen-Lan LIN,"Indigenous peoples, Indigenous tribal schools, Subjectivity, Cultural revitalization, Pedagogical practice","Starting from the 1990s, indigenous communities have actively engaged in cultural revitalization to reclaim indigenous subjectivity through either education developments within the system or development models outside of the system. A key feature was to go from having differences (discrimination) received by indigenous students within the education system to the indigenous peoples establishing independence (autonomy and subjectivity) in their own education from the restrictions of the education system. This article examines how the educational practices and cultural revitalization of indigenous tribal schools: (1) reveal the profoundness of ＂rediscovering indigenous tribes＂, and (2) demonstrate the indigenous peoples’ tendency toward manufacturing tribal culture and reclaiming tribal subjectivity. Through a multi-perspective approach that analyzes government policies, education texts, media discourse, video analysis, participant observation and in-depth interviews, this article maps the development of indigenous tribal education from its colonization and assimilation to the fight for autonomy and self-determination. The Council of Indigenous Peoples therefore proposed the ＂Indigenous Tribal Schools Establishment Plan＂ in 2012 to plan for the establishment of thirty indigenous tribal schools within the following ten years. Although indigenous tribal schools are a new form of tribal education, they are even more so a form of establishment of the indigenous peoples’ cultural rights. However, the process of establishing these schools has also brought up many issues for consideration: (1) There should be reflections on the relationship between the indigenous peoples and the government in terms of whether the indigenous peoples are resource-dependent on or resource-independent from the government, as well as whether the indigenous peoples should follow the government policies in all aspects or retain some tribal autonomy. (2) The establishment of the indigenous tribal schools resulted in competition, fractures and oppositions between different regional tribes. Because priority wasn’t made in regards to the cultural preservation of the minority tribes in the policies, the establishment of indigenous tribal schools resulted in majority tribes seizing larger shares of resources than minority tribes. Consequently, there is doubt raised on the fair distribution of resources across tribes. (3) There should be a review on the imagination of ＂ethnicity＂ that is used as the basis in the establishment of indigenous tribal schools, and the cultural elements that are either revived or made from the educational practices of these schools. (4) ＂Tribe＂, when used in a trans-regional sense, integrates different local tribes but overlooks the individual elements and differences of each tribe’s subjectivity. Employing the term ＂tribe＂ to group the indigenous people together and streamlining tribal differences into one homogenous system in the indigenous tribal schools’ educational practices rob the different tribes of their cultural distinctions and limit the locality and regional uniqueness of each of their existing cultures. This article presents the emerging context behind the establishment and the progress of indigenous tribal schools, analyzes their development and mechanism, seeks to understand how they have come to be a reflection of tribal democracy being established or cultural conflict at work, and outlines ways that the indigenous peoples can advance towards tribal self-determination and preserving their subjectivity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201807-201808130001-201808130001-97-170,26,2018,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Inner Exile: The Psychic Landscape of Incest Trauma,Jen-Yu PENG,"Inner exile, Clinical fieldwork, Psychic reality, Incest trauma, Psychic landscape","Contemporary psychiatry and clinical psycholog y generally frame the incest trauma within the positivist discourse of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This categorization goes hand in hand with a tendency to pathologize and medicate psychotrauma. However, the standardized diagnostic reasoning may render the trauma invisible to the professional eye. In practice, due to the ineffability of incest trauma, victims are often subjected to different diagnoses of mental illness (schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorders, etc.). For how can psychological trauma be seen or conceived? From a psychoanalytical perspective, and based on ＂clinical fieldwork＂ (Peng 2014a) on incest trauma over a decade, the author advances the notion of the ＂psychic landscape＂ to illustrate the power of imagery metaphors as a means to access to the subject's inner experience. For many incest survivors, ＂home＂, the presupposed fundamental space for constructing self-identity, is constituted of ambivalent representations that often combine one element with its very opposite: for instance, persecution-attachment, betrayal-demand for loyalty. The consequence is that the survivor's self is forced into a state of ＂inner exile＂, in which the split self is permanently monitored and there is no ＂outside＂ to flee to; i.e., the subject is deprived of authority over her/his own psychic territory. The extreme terror of inner exile can manifest itself in puzzling symptoms, such as inexplicable fear, global anxiety, somatization, dissociation, lying, repeated victimization, etc. Taking a Taiwanese incest survivor's case as an example, this paper describes the transferential process through which the traumatic psychic landscape emerges. By doing so, the author reiterates the need to go beyond the pathologizing tendency in contemporary psychiatry and bring the psychic reality, or subjective truth, back into focus when approaching psychotrauma.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201807-201808130001-201808130001-171-226,26,2018,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Exploring the Application of Photovoice Methodology: A Case Study of the Homeless Belonging Exhibition,Yi-Wen CHENG,"Photovoice, Homeless, Empowerment, Photography, Participatory research","In this article, the theoretical contexts and prototype of photovoice methodology would be summarized at first. As a qualitative method used for participatory research, photovoice was formally proposed by Caroline Wang and Mary Ann Burris in the 1990s. They defined photovoice as an empowering process that combines photography with grassroots social action. Participants are asked to express their points of view by photographing scenes that highlight research themes, and these photographs are collaboratively interpreted through group discussions and then narratives can be used to promote dialogue to mobilize and help change-makers.

The Sociological Imagination around the Conception of the ＂Sinification of Buddhism＂,Cheng LIN,"Chinese Renaissance, History of Chan, Sinification of Buddhism, Hu Shih","The process of ＂sinification＂ would have an origin in the fact that what entered China as Buddhist ideas were not made in India. The sustainable development of Buddhism in China hardly has any relationship with the Indian tradition. And the Chinese influences on Buddhism are as obvious and impressive as Buddhism affected Chinese civilization. The word ＂sinification＂ thus provides the researchers a very useful conceptual instrument to capture the main part of the Buddhist movement, from the Taoist tendency to the Chan school where Chinese Buddhism establishes its autonomy. The problem which follows is that the birth of the ＂sinification＂, treated as a concept, remains all the more vague when this term becomes more productive. As we shall observe, in the frequent uses of this term, there is not a will to know its early designer or representative. The task of this article is to trace the formation of this concept and understand its implication. It asks: Who is capable of elaborating this concept? A scholar that studies the history of Chinese philosophy and that of Chinese Buddhism, Hu Shih, in particular, with regards to his studies on the Chan School, is among others a possible candidate for taking on sinification as a concept. This identification implies simultaneously another question: what does Hu intend to express in this study? Against conventional understanding of Hu's work, the problem of his study is not characterized by his antireligious mentality, but rather lies in his conception of Buddhism in three stages, the history of Chan, the Chinese Renaissance and the ＂Indianization of China＂. Distinguishing essentially the Chinese school of Buddhism from what is Indian, Hu's study tells us a possible story of how the idea of ＂sinification＂ was first conceived.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201712-201804130001-201804130001-9-42,25,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Confucianism and Japanese Modernity: Maruyama Masao's Discourses on Tokugawa Confucianism,Hung-Yueh LAN,"Modernity, Japan, Confucianism, Maruyama Masao, Ogyū Sorai","Researches on Confucianism and Japanese Modernity usually traced back to Confucian philosopher Ogyū Sorai (1666-1728), because Maruyama Masao, one of the most influential thinkers in postwar Japan, described Sorai's Confucianism as going beyond the confines of Neo-Confucianism, and connected it to the ideas and practices of modernization in his Studies in the intellectual history of Tokugawa Japan during the 1940s. However, from the 1950s to the 1960s, Maruyama reconsidered this question and shifted the emphasis in his lectures, which were later published as Maruyama Masao kōgiroku (Collected transcripts of the lectures of Maruyama Masao) Volume 6 and 7. The concept of Japanization was applied here by Maruyama to interpret Tokugawa Confucianism, and how Neo-Confucianism helped Japanese intellectuals to accept modern thoughts from Europe also came into focus. Between Ogyū Sorai and Neo-Confucianism, I note that there are changes in Maruyama Masao's discourses on Tokugawa Confucianism and modernity.

In an era when the mode of production maintained stability, marriage stood at the center of the traditional social structure. However, men who were unable to support their family due to poverty, illness, indolence, or extravagance turned to wife-selling and mortgaging as a survival strategy. Sometimes the husband married off his wife to someone else, or else tolerated or abetted his wife's illicit intercourse. The author utilizes cases from the Qing legal documents, contracts, journalism, customs investigation reports, Japanese court verdicts, and other sources to investigate sex work within marital contexts. Understanding this topic allows researchers to reconstruct marital pedigrees in the Taiwanese substratum, and detect how they employed their agency to transform the values of the upper stratum.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201712-201804130001-201804130001-81-130,25,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Analyzing how the rebuilding of ＂national culture＂ constructed ＂high culture＂ in the field of popular religion through the description of ＂the movement of the revitalization of Chinese culture＂ and ＂the national session of literature and art＂ in the 1990s, the author discusses how a new form of cultural capital was constructed and gave rise to ＂new temple festival culture＂. The author points out that the temple discussed in this article had gone through two significant political ideology changes. They redefined the content of the capitals of the field and resulted in the change of popular religion. The first one influenced this temple by the rewriting of ＂national history＂. This rewriting influenced the implication of ＂historical time＂ in the popular religion field and made the relevance to ＂Zheng Cheng-Gong＂ an efficient capital. And that made the village people started to engage in developing their temple. The second one influenced the temple by the rebuilding of the ＂national culture＂. It defined new contents of the legitimate cultural factors in the field and therefore changed the course of the progress of this temple.

Politics of Fear: Pension Insurance and Chinese Peasant Workers,"Wei SHI, Shih-Diing LIU","Migrant worker, Body, Subjectivity, Politics of fear, Pension insurance","The social conflict triggered by social insurance contributions has become a key component of the ensuing crisis of contemporary mainland China. This article focuses on an episode of the strike action staged by a group of migrant workers at a UNIQLO supplier in Shenzhen, exploring the vulnerable group's fear generated by the underpayment of social security and the political action that follows, from the perspective of affective politics. This paper investigates the ways in which politics of fear configures and articulates in a relational structure of power; the hegemony formulates a set of top-down strategies of governance out of the fear for losing power, which in turn create the fear of migrant workers through the long-standing prejudicial policies and complicities with capital; the transformation of government-inflicted fear into concrete political action from the bottom up and the intensification of fear of the hegemony. Through such analytic trajectory, this paper explores the heterogeneous political formations of fear, how they are interwoven in complex ways, and in particular how the performance of opposition is made possible through the body and the construction of identity. For the migrant workers under multiple forms of repression, the politics of fear may create a space of self-empowerment, allowing them to reshape self-identities and subvert the existing power relations in their adversarial confrontations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201712-201804130001-201804130001-183-214,25,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Moral Panic and the Legacy of Authoritarianism: Democratization and the Policies on Ketamine in Taiwan,"Liang-Yin HSU, Ming-Feng LIU","Democratization, Elias, Moral panics, Civilizing processes, Ketamine","In Taiwan, ketamine use among the young people has increased in recent years. Some legislators have called for upgrading ketamine use to a more serious criminal offence. These calls have been repeatedly rebuffed - for the eighth time in two years - by the advisory council which sets drug policy. We examined the context in which the demand for reclassification and the harsher punishment of ketamine users has arisen. We draw on the concept of ＂moral panic＂ and focused on the nature of the reaction to the problem by a particular group of people (legislators) in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, we tied the concept of moral panic to Nobert Elias' arguments concerning the ＂civilizing processes.＂ We situated this ＂short-term＂ moral panic, which we regarded as a ＂decivilizing＂ process, within the longer term ＂civilizing＂ process of democratization. In this article, we argued that, in Taiwan, democratization (a civilizing process) has played an important role in fostering the conditions in which moral panics (a decivilizing process) can thrive, and showed that the rhetoric of moral panic - in the ketamine case at least - is heavily inflected by the legacy of authoritarianism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201712-201804130001-201804130001-215-252,25,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"National Museum, Cultural Citizenship and Indigenous Peoples: National Palace Museum Reforms under Tu Cheng-sheng",Mei-Fen Lu,"Formosa exhibition, Austronesian, Knowledge classification, Contact zone, Model of status, Nation-state","The focus of this study is on the reforms of the National Palace Museum during the time that Tu Cheng-sheng served as its director (2000-2004), including a deep exploration of why the museum transitioned to a multicultural national museum. How did Tu use multicultural identity to amend Chinese nationalism, as well as initiate discussions on and implement the objective of ＂Austronesian peoples＂ as members of the national citizenry? In 2003, Tu's views on multicultural national museum changed direction toward that of Universal Museum (including Asian museum). How did this transformation influence the Chinese nationalism revision methods and the citizenship status of the indigenous peoples? Indigenous peoples need to be recognized, not just for their unique identity, but also as general cultural citizens. The author analyses both cultural representation and cultural production, with particular focus on the making of ＂ourselves/coexistence＂, museum classification and hierarchy. These were used to analyze the conditions for and the difficulties of indigenous peoples participating as peers in national cultural representation. In conclusion, the reforms of the National Palace Museum at the time were entangled in denationalization, deChinalization and depoliticization. This led to failure to concentrate indigenous peoples' participation as peers. Under the opposing duality of ＂Taiwanese culture＂ and ＂Chinese culture＂, the main reasons why importance was placed on the Austronesian peoples were their ＂prehistoric＂ ancestry and ＂marine＂ geographical construct.

"Art, the Nation, and the Individual in Japanese modern society","ITO, Toru, Su-chu LI","Kishida Ryūsei, Natsume Sōseki, Takahas hi Yuichi, Toyama Masakazu, Shirakaba-ha","We normally take ＂fine art＂ as an act by an individual creator, and his work as an expression of his personality. However such an image of ＂fine art＂ has already lost its plausibility in the circumstances of today, which for example, often includes team production in the case of movies or animation films. This paper deals with two oil painters in the Japanese modern time, Takahashi Yuichi and Kishida Ryūsei, and their realistic intentions, in order to explore their differing fundamental thoughts. Takahashi, the pioneer of Japanese oil painting, was impressed by the painting style introduced by the Western world during the Meiji Restoration and devoted himself to its acquisition and spread throughout Japan. His passion was sustained by his belief that the exact representation of oil painting could contribute to the modernization of Japan as state. On the contrary Kishida's realism has its background in individualism after the Russo-Japanese War. The individualistic style of thought shared by many contemporary artists and intellectuals tended to combine the individual personality with the transcendent named ＂Nature＂ or ＂Humankind＂. In the case of Kishida the representation of ordinary things in paintings meant the assimilation of himself to ＂the Great Nature＂. Contrasting the differences between both painters, this article shows a change from the state to the individual in the intellectual history of Japanese modern time, which can provide the concept of ＂fine arts＂ with a historical view point.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201710-201711240004-201711240004-53-80,24,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Displayed Houses as Sacralized Space: on Identity Mechanism of the Landless Hokkaido Ainu,Shih-chung Hsieh,"Sacralization, Ainu, Touristic display, Ancestral worship, Hokkaido, Ritual space","In general an ethnic group strengthens self-identity through well-kept ritual performances. For the Ainu in Hokkaido, Japan, although almost of all public ceremonies had been prohibited they secretly continued practicing ancestral worship ritual at home during the era of severe assimilation policy by the Japanese government. Since the late 18th century, the rulers deprived the Ainu of lands and destroyed all natural villages in their territory. But the people grasped any possible opportunity to hold rituals of offering food and liquor to their ancestors. In present times some traditional public ceremonies have been gradually revived, while the crucial part of their activities remains the ancestral worship ritual. Activists of cultural revival movements often claim to have restored lost festivals, ceremonies, or rituals. Indeed the Ainu activists had contended that all traditional public rituals should return. But what they have done to transform particular buildings displayed for tourists in outdoor museum into sacralized space for holding ancestral worship rituals. In Hokkaido the museums with Ainu culture exhibits always come with several independent old-fashioned houses nearby. And many of them have been sacralized and called traditional names such as kotan (village/community) and chise (house/home) by the Ainu. In contrast to those modern buildings these ancient styled houses are considered much closer to cultural authenticity. The Ainu have been recognized as Japan's indigenous people since 2008 but mainstream society is still very indifferent to the Ainu situation. The newly-identified indigenes adopt alternative strategies to ＂occupy＂ or ＂own＂ traditional houses at the very moment of worshipping ancestors under the circumstance of losing their original territory and facing a landless daily life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201710-201711240004-201711240004-81-116,24,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Narrative of Hong Kong Colonial History in Centry-Old Dreams Of A Fishing Harbour,LAW Wing Sang,"Luting, Tanka, Post-humanism, Shakespeare, Colonial, Post-colonial criticism, Hong Kong, The Tempest","Since the bloom of local productions in Hong Kong theatre starting from the eighties, there are plenty of theatrical works dwelling on the identity issues of Hong Kong. However, seldom has any play attempted to give Hong Kong colonial past a coherent historical narrative. Moreover, even though feelings and thinking about the anxieties of one's belonging are often displayed vividly on the stage, few would go beyond the Chinese nationalistic frame to interpret historical events happened in the colony. However, local playwright Wong Kwok Kui has achieved a breakthrough in his recent work Century-old dreams of a fishing harbor (first installment) from this tradition. Making use of the mythic figure Luting, the play reconstructs a historical narrative of the city from neither a colonialist nor a Chinese nationalist viewpoint. This essay tries to offer, from a post-colonialist perspective, a reading of the play to unravel the intricacies embedded and to see how it makes a reassessment of Hong Kong colonial past possible. It will also attempt an inter-textual reading between Wong's play with Shakespeare's The Tempest. From this vantage point, the essay will argue for the important contributions of post-humanism to post-colonial criticisms, in general, as well as Hong Kong emerging localism, in particular.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201710-201711240004-201711240004-117-136,24,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Towards an Aesthetic of Awkwardness: The Postcolonial and Postfeminist Politics of Fashion Blogs in Taiwan,Fan-Ting Cheng,"Fashion industry, Blog, Awkwardness, Taiwan, Locality, Queerness","In the past decade, blogging has played a critical role in the fashion industry in Taiwan, taking part in the formation of the local identity. While gaining increasing visibility in academia, the intersection of fashion studies and media studies has not been investigated in any depth. The emphasis on the illusory tricks imbedded in fashion construction made by the Frankfurt School Marxists and anti-porn feminists ignore the resistant agency of the consumer. This paper takes renowned Taiwanese fashion blogs as examples, examining the power apparatus and identity formation worked by bloggers, readers, and the media. This paper further reconsiders the position and potential of fashion blogs/blogging in capitalist networks. Employing media studies, performative discourses, fashion discussions, as well as post-colonialist and post-feminist theories, this paper intends to develop a political aesthetic of awkwardness as demonstrated by local fashion blogs. An awkward scenario refers to a subject's conscious, tactical parody and appropriation when confronting its political, economic and cultural chasm with other(s). It is the ultimate goal of this paper to further elaborate on the aesthetics of awkwardness, developing it into a flexible methodology that contributes to the research on diverse/alternative practices of resistance in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201710-201711240004-201711240004-137-167,24,2017,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Concepts of 3/18,HUNG Shih-Chian,"Badiou, Event, Anonymous, Derrida, Void","More than a year has passed after the 3/18 Student Movement (or the Sunflower Student Movement). However, can we name this movement merely by the numbers such as 3/18? Or 3/18 is a thing so complicated that we cannot designate 3/18 by any means of naming? Or does this movement signify something as we attempt to designate this big event recently occurred in Taiwan by the number of 3/18? Both Jacques Derrida and Alain Badiou bear the same contention that event signifies a beyond reality, or that event does not exist within the existing understanding and framework. Hence, as the event occurs, it must be something singular, rather than what it was. As Derrida argues, the inability of understanding and reduction cannot prevent us from rethinking this event. Instead, we must try to know more, more slowly, and think this ＂event＂ more without confinement. If we tend to regard 3/18 as trace, then it is a thing that occurred but hasn't passed yet. The effects that come after it still continue to happen. Even after a year of this movement, any description on the 3/18 movement can merely be considered traces for the 3/18 movement-traces intimately related to the subject itself.

This is the time as event place and space as nomad distribution. Second, it is an internal temporality of the event, which is the space-time emancipated. Finally, transgression reached a political climax that is simultaneously the zero degree of thought. One of the magnitudes of the movement 318 is that it moves the knowledge frontier. There is a crystallography of time, by analyzing the decrease and increase of the intensity of event. And there is also a political chorography, expressed by a spatial language.

Taking Gilles Deleuze's ＂the movement-image＂ and Jacques Rancière's ＂the politics of the aesthetics＂ as major theoretical points of departure, this paper focuses on the ＂photographic image＂ of the Sunflower Movement to highlight its fast proliferation, connection, propagation, circulation and disruption triggered by the ＂the flow of cell phone media and web image.＂ The first half of the paper will start with two photo books-The Sunrise and The Island's Sunrise Seen from Our Eyes-in an attempt to map out the entwinement of ＂the aesthetics of big camera＂ and ＂the eyewitness of historical event.＂ The second half of the paper will foreground ＂the aesthetics of small cell phone＂ and its ＂virtual mediality＂ to explore how it is implicated in the change of contemporary photographic technology and materiality, and also how it can ＂intervene＂ radically into the representational system and the distribution of the sensible of both social movements and the history of photography in Taiwan. If the thinking triggered by the ＂photographic image＂ of the Sunflower Movement stands not merely as the representation of ＂318 Occupy Legislative Yuan＂ (of Anti-Cross Strait Service Trade Agreement, of civil disobedience and so on) and the following events, it could turn out to be a ＂nuclear explosion of image,＂ radically changing at the intersection of the mobile phone, web image and big data the traditionally established relationship between photography and social movements in Taiwan.

An Analogical Translation of The Sunflower Movement: Between the Logistical Coup in the Global State and The Creation of the Commons,Jon Solomon,"Modernity, Translation theory, Logistics, Free trade deals, Cybernetics, The state, Colonialism, The Sunflower Movement, Sovereignty","This essay is an exercise in contextualization, applied to the 2014 Sunflower Movement, that aims to achieve an analogical continuation of the Movement. At the center of its efforts at contextualization, the essay examines the political meaning of the current changes in global capitalism. The concrete indices of this change, which ought to be characterized as an event of Massive Historical Transformation, include debt, financialization, digitalization, algorithmic governance, transnational free trade deals, digital labor, logistics and sovereignty, etc. The working hypothesis of this paper is that the political meaning of these transformations can be summarized by the idea of a corporate coup in the emerging Global State. Hence, this essay could be understood as a dialogue between two events, the Sunflower Movement and the Corporate Coup in the Global State. As such, its main mission is to distinguish those parts of the Sunflower Movement that resist the global coup from those parts that might be complicit with it. The underlying concern in advancing this distinction is to destroy the political and intellectual apparatus of colonial-imperial modernity: the framework of species difference. Just as the word species covers three domains, biology, economy and general taxonomy, this essay aims to grasp at a macro level the importance of species difference to the political organization of populations, the disciplinary organization of knowledge, and the capitalist organization of labor. In order to prevent the infrastructure of the colonial-imperial modernity, the apparatus of species difference, from being mobilized by the new wave of colonization gathering in our era, the colonization of the biosphere, this essay attempts to find resources for resistance and creation in theories of translation and technical objects, in order to destroy the subjective technology of the apparatus of species difference. In other words, the focus of this essay's foray into political theory is to be elaborated through the question, how to resist logistics and cybernetics?

From Pirate Nation to Farming Village: Hong Kong's Maritime and Agrarian Narratives under the State Sovereignty,Kwai-Cheung Lo,"Nation-state, Narrative, Agriculture, Pirate, Hong Kong","While historical narrative of a society has been overwhelmingly framed by the nation-state, there has been a different mode of depicting the past as well as the present in the fugitive society of Hong Kong. This essay examines how the romantic narrative of pirates in the past and the agrarian narrative at the present have captured the imagination of many Hong Kong people. Narrative in this context is understood as something yet to establish itself as a coherent ideological subjectivization but constitutes certain imaginary relations to the external conditions, or functions as a socially symbolic praxis. The content of such narrative could be conflicting in itself, revealing it is more a product of diverse collective experience and thinking than any consistent project. The essay analyzes how the maritime piracy on the southern Chinese coasts has been appropriated in the Hong Kong regional narrative to parallel Hong Kong collective imaginary as well as real situations. The pirate society was assumed as the epitome of Hong Kong refugee society of the 1950s, projecting freedom from the state control or any sovereign authority. The essay also looks at an inchoate agrarian narrative about Hong Kong facing up the looming power of the Chinese sovereign state after the 1997 handover. Such agrarian alternative seeks to secure Hong Kong community as an autonomous place by advocating the revival of farming activities in order to voice the dissent from the increasingly centralized rule by embedding sentiment for the locality within a series of modern global discourses, such as ecology movements, organic farming, food sovereignty, environmentalism, and preservation of heritage. Although these non-state narratives may be criticized as phantasy, they may effect as potential events that allow something to be reproduced under oblivion.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201609-201704210016-201704210016-127-140,23,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"The Paradoxical Relationship among Hong Kong Local Discourse, Cultural Decolonization and Postcolonial Trauma: The Case of Queen's Pier Preservation Movement",Iris Pui-Sze Cheung,"Local discourse, Postcolonialism, Colonialism, Hong Kong studies, Trauma, Queen's Pier Preservation Movement, Decolonization","The Queen's Pier, built in 1953-1954, served as a significant structure during the colonial era in Hong Kong. Being part of the Central Reclamation Phase III project, the Queen's Pier had to be demolished to make way for the reclamation of Victoria Harbour. The demolition of Queen's Pier drew strong opposition from the public, which triggered a conflict between the government and the public. The Queen's Pier Preservation Movement refers to the movement emerged in 2006-07 in response to this demolition plan, which aimed at preserving Hong Kong's historical space and local cultures. By examining the paradoxical relationship among local discourse, cultural decolonization and postcolonial trauma, this paper seeks to examine the situation of Hong Kong after 1997. The Queen's Pier Preservation Movement emphasized localism, action, autonomy, self-determination and individual participation, aimed at rewriting Hong Kong's history and safeguarding its autonomy. It denoted a change in the attitudes and values of the young generation towards Hong Kong and governance. By analyzing the strategies employed by the protesters, I argue that the significance of this movement is twofold: first, it demonstrated a strong resistance to economic growth and urban entrepreneurialism at the expense of local cultures and histories. Second, a new sense of localism focusing on autonomy and self-determination was fostered during the movement, which clearly marked a critical turn in localism. In addition, by contrasting the viewpoints of the government and the protesters over the issues of cultural development, heritage preservation and urban renewal, it inadvertently provoked a debate on 'decolonization' and 'pro-colonization'. This ironically revealed the legacy of colonialism in post-1997 Hong Kong in terms of bureaucratic administration and distribution of power. Despite mass protests by the public, the pier was finally dismantled and completely demolished in February 2008. I conclude that the failure of this movement, in fact, exposed Hong Kong's traumatic condition after 1997.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201609-201704210016-201704210016-141-164,23,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

In an attempt to understand what has brought about the present difficulties in the relationship between the two places, the essay offers a reading of what it calls Hong Kong's ＂internal racism＂ against mainlanders. That the essay chooses not to discuss in detail the territory's constitutional statues and identity or its so-called ＂core values＂ does not mean that its author overlooks these important issues. The essay has its focus on the advancement of the following points: 1) that the convergence of Hong Kong's neoliberal capitalism and its colonial culture has played a singular role in defining Hong Kong's rejection of the mainland and 2) that its ideological and political divergence from the mainland, which has frequently been considered by commentators as the locale of tension and conflict, may be read as intensified manifestation of its deep-seated capitalistic/colonial way of life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201609-201704210016-201704210016-187-200,23,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Agricultural Renaissance in Taiwan,Yen-Ling Tsai,"Multispecies ethnography, Alternative agri-food network, Friendly farming, Agriculture in Taiwan, Rural-urban dynamics","Based on fieldwork among a community of sustainable smallholder farmers self-identified as ＂friendly farmers＂, this article deals with the promises and paradoxes of a new politics of food and agriculture in Taiwan. I argue that this politics is first and foremost about the articulation of a new rationality of agriculture, which emphasizes not only the economic value of agriculture, but also its multiple functions in fostering environmental stewardship, community livelihood, local food sovereignty, and regional biodiversity. No less impressive is the fact that humans and non-humans from all walks of live have participated in various articulations of this new rationality. On the consumer end, for example, artists and writers help to re-situate agriculture in urban settings, bringing farmers' life worlds from field to table. On the production side, friendly farmers work against the green revolution legacy by choosing not to poison and exterminate the invasive golden apple snails. Instead, they hand pick snails and learn to transform the relationship between rice farmers and snails from one of opposition to that of collaboration. In this process, the open-ended assemblage that these farmers and non-farmers, human and non-human actants create, has collectively expanded the social horizon, cultural significance, and economic viabilities of agriculture in contemporary Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201603-201610270012-201610270012-23-74,22,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
In the Name of the Farmer: A Historical Review of Agrarian Movements in Postwar Taiwan,Jui-Hua Chen,"Community reconstruction, Alter-globalization, Food sovereignty, Agrarian movement, Farmer's movement, Land justice","This article aims to review the social movements launched in the name of the farmer in postwar Taiwan, as an attempt to illustrate the connotations of contemporary agrarian movements through historical comparison. By comparing causes and petitions of agrarian movements taking place in different period of times, the article argues that with the transformation of modernity, the focus of agrarian movements gradually shifted from class to environment, from securing factors crucial to the agricultural production and the distribution of agricultural profits to concerns regarding the food safety of their compatriots and the sustainability of the global environment. In such transitions, the connotation of the land shifted as well. In 1950s, the land was fought over as the essential element of production; in the 1970s, while the industrial pollutions became obvious, the land began to hold the connotation of environment; in the late 1980s, ignited by the government's attempt to corporate with the neo-liberalistic global economic order, farmers' anger that has been accumulated for a long time once again made class issue became the main concern of the agrarian movement, while at the same time, farmlands were considered as properties under the control of nation-state and were requested to be allowed to sell without restriction. At around 2010, facing the dire situation of the continuous loss of farmlands and drastic environmental changes, the agrarian movement defended farmlands as properties of farmers that had been despoiled. However, behind the petition of protecting people's property as their basic right, the core concern of the movement is the preservation of farmland and reconstructing agriculture. Reconstructing agriculture is of fundamental importance here, since it not only influences the farmer and the agrarian section, but also the reconstruction of social relations and the restoration of the ecosystem. Nevertheless, it does not mean the new agrarian movement is going to cover up or neglect the class interest of farmers in the name of universal values or eco-friendly claims. On the contrary, it tries to integrate universal value and particular interest, to incorporate environmental issue with class issue, in order to form a force to resist the prevailing developmentalistic mentality and the rent-seeking practices in land planning policies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201603-201610270012-201610270012-75-122,22,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Middle City Development and Urban-rural Reconfiguration,"Ya-Chung Chuang, Shu-Jung Chen","Market, Space, Agriculture, Middle City, Urban-rural Relationship","This paper investigates a seemingly impossible relation between what we have called middle city and agricultural life in Taiwan. Examining middle city on a reginal scale, we find a spatial configuration that represents a unique way of urban-rural connection. This spatial legacy from the agrarian past provides clues to an understanding of the current urban question and the future of the city life. We began our study with a newly emergent farmers' market in the Yuanlin township at the roadsides of a particular street. The dynamism of a new street life in the evolving market brings us to observe the urban-rural reconnection in this area and its special effect on the city life. The observation also leads to rethinking the future of the city in terms of the revitalization of a regional agricultural life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201603-201610270012-201610270012-123-146,22,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

The first part emphasizes Wu Yin-ning's writing heritage and specialty, for instance, writing background, ideals of Leftist literature, and the creation of a new style combined with audiovisual effects. The second section discusses the use of visual techniques of shooting and cutting to create dialogue among different people, objects, and events. Such writing aesthetic conveys the essential feelings for the land in order to highlight the motif of ＂Food is life.＂ The third part explores how writing imitates various voices and sounds to reproduce historical events. These audio techniques include testimony, narration, dubbing and sound effects. Debates among different perspectives together contribute to the declaration of the core idea, ＂Land is the root of agriculture.＂ This idea reflects how ridiculous agricultural policies in Taiwan are made in accordance with ideology of globalization.

Postmodern Aesthetics and Class Consciousness in Contemporary Taiwan Fiction,Yun-Hung Lin,"Taiwanese Literary History, False consciousness, Taiwan postmodern fiction, Class consciousness, Marxism","This article is a meditation on the ＂class consciousness＂ as expressed in literary texts by examining the contemporary Taiwan fiction under the influence of postmodern aesthetic movement in the late 1980. First of all, I discuss the misrecognition of capitalist institutions, namely why people fail to truly understand their class interests, as well as why they tend to accept their own status quo of being governed in the production relations in capitalism. Next, through the intense longing for consumerist lifestyles revealed in contemporary Taiwan fiction, we can make the observation that the ＂postmodern genre＂ not only has its strong classism but postmodern aesthetics often approves of the bourgeois pursuit of material comfort and wealth. Third, this article also seeks to analyze the narratives of romantic love in Taiwan postmodern fiction, in which the pursuit of romantic love reveals the optimistic longing for social mobility. This explains why postmodern fiction, while cognizant of class division, often fails to critique this phenomenon. Last but not least, the macro issue of history will be addressed. In contemporary Taiwan fiction, the very type of postmodern aesthetics that emphasizes self-reflexivity and deconstruction also questions the emancipatory politics toward which socialist thought opens, thereby legitimatizing the historical process of capitalism in the name of progress and development. Overall, while the postmodern aesthetics in Taiwan fiction accurately identifies the economic character and class inequality of Taiwanese society, the postmodern genre still holds a certain conservative view that on one hand, structural inequity can be overcome through individual effort and, one the other, class inequality is a natural consequence of historical progress.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201603-201610270012-201610270012-177-208,22,2016,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

I call it the aestheticization of neoliberal capitalism. My concern in this paper is with the aestheticization of the neoliberal capitalism that was manipulated and executed by the contemporary States. I shall discuss the double cycle of the use and consumption of bodies in the artistic labor through my reading of a contemporary Chinese artist Xu Bing (徐冰1955- ). The primary process of the uses of the bodies by the State, the polis, took us to the question of the forms of life under the dictate of the political economy as discussed by Agamben, and the question as to how and why human life, through the uses of bodies, is shaped, measured, calculated, regulated and processed into various forms of life. In order to think the power of life or the potential of life that would not be always already administered and distributed according to the reason of the polis, I juxtapose François Jullien’s formulation of the concept of shi (potential, inclination, tendency) that he derived from classical Chinese philosophy with the Western concept of potentia/potesta as well as from the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi; and I discuss the possibility of a new critical and political use of body through the politics of aesthetics as this possibility presents itself in Xu Bing's work.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201512-201602170013-201602170013-9-36,21,2015,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Dancing in the Margin: Homosexual Films of the 1980s and Early 1990s in Taiwan,Chun-Chi Wang,"Film history, Homosexual visibility, Homosexual films","Against cultural and political conservatism of mainstream commercial films in the 1970s, Taiwan New Cinema's thematic search for a lost self in national terms and artistically-oriented aesthetics have made it long be recognized as the epitome of national cinema of Taiwan. It is also the central point of reference in constructing the history of Taiwan cinema, exemplified by such terms as the ＂second wave Taiwan New Cinema＂ and ＂post-Taiwan New Cinema.＂ The over presence of Taiwan New Cinema, however, has structured a slanted film history of Taiwan that underlines the exclusive importance of national cinema that foregrounds art-house style and concerns for male-centered and heterodominant nationhood. Accordingly, the contemporaries of Taiwan New Cinema have been by and large forgotten, including films that deal with homosexual subject-matter. This paper excavates three neglected homosexual films-＂Girls' School＂ (Li Mei-mi, 1982), ＂The Outsiders＂ (Yu Kan-ping, 1986), and ＂The Silent Thrush＂ (Zheng Sheng-fu, 1991)-made around the same time as Taiwan New Cinema and before the ＂tongzhi＂ rights discourse has affected the realm of cultural representations. I argue that the ways in which these films approach, engage and negotiate issues of homosexuality have to be understood as part of a genealogy of ＂tongzhi＂ representation despite the fact that they may seem shoddy, lowbrow and stereotypical. They need to be contextualized and perceived as indicative of a particular struggle of the representation of homosexuality, and it is from this perspective that these early homosexual films are important to the cinematic imagination and construction of Taiwan that deserve to go down in the history of Taiwanese cinema.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201503-201509030009-201509030009-11-52,20,2015,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Gangster, Nation and Masculinity: Gangster Men in Taiwanese Post-Martial Law Films",Dominique Ying-Chih Liao,"Taiwanese Post-Martial Law Film, Gangster, Taiwanese Alternative Cinema, Taiwanese Identity, Masculinity","Masculinity has been the most important issue in creating the images of gangster men. However, masculinity cannot simply be defined as bodily image with well built-up muscles and the capability for violent acts. Rather, what makes a gangster man masculine relies more on the ideology beneath that determines the acts he takes, which in many cases reflect the bigger cultural and social issues in the specific context. Gangster themes and characters are the frequent themes or backbones in Taiwanese films in the post-martial law era, but most researches focus on the identity and modernity issues under the tradition of Taiwan New Cinema. ＂City of Sadness＂, for instance, is the most discussed film with considerable emphasis on gangster themes. However, analyses surrounding the gangster themes, characters and the identity issues involved in the film are hardly available. Discussions of masculinity have been closely related with the pursuit of secured identities, and thus the masculinity displayed by the gangster men in the post-martial law films has to be scrutinized in regard to the anxieties of identity issues in Taiwanese context. This essay focuses on the qualities of masculinity in Taiwanese films in the post-martial law era, and investigates how such masculinity displays the identity quandary in Taiwan through the struggles of gangsterdom.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201503-201509030009-201509030009-53-78,20,2015,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

In what ways are they providing discursive spaces to negotiate with the mainstream ideologies? I argue that these matchmaking reality TV shows create neoliberalized romantic encounters and obscure structural violence, which further reinforces the logic of neoliberalism.

"Popular Memory, Chineseness and Female Immigrants: A Case Study on Wu Cun's Mahua Cinema",Wai-Siam Hee,"Popular Memory, Mahua Cinema, Chineseness, Wu Cun","This article examines three Sinophone films shot in Singapore by director Wu Cun from China after the Second World War. Through close reading of these filmic texts and reportings and discussions of them in the 1940s Singapore-Malayan cinema tabloids ＂Amusement＂ and ＂Dianying Quan＂, this article aims to reconstruct the popular memory of ＂Mahua (Malaysian Chinese) Cinemas＂ and their relationship with ＂Mahua Literature＂ and Chinese film culture. It also probes the naming of ＂Mahua Cinema＂ in their temporal context and how they re-present post-war Malayan Chinese female migrants, loyalists, and foreigners, with reference to historical materials on the migration of Chinese females to Nanyang in early days. Women play the lead in all three films, while men assume supporting roles. Through the ramblings of a madwoman, it predicts the binary oppositional thought of the cold war period. This article also critically employs relevant Cold War Singaporean and Malaysian theories to analyse and compare the Chineseness and political groups in these films. All three films were produced after the war, when the Malayan Communist Party, who debated aggressively about the ＂uniqueness of Malayan Chinese literature and art＂, was burgeoning. Besides attempting to portray the real Singapore-Malayan local colour in that time and place as advocated by the ＂uniqueness of Malaysian Chinese literature and art＂, Wu Cun and his local production partners, the Shaw Brothers Company, also re-presented the left-wing practice of Malayan Communist Party guerillas and their supporters that had been suppressed by mainstream historical discourse. This article holds that the complexity of Chineseness and its ideology in these three early Mahua films lies in their being ＂neither Malaysian nor Chinese＂, that is, being neither purely Malaysian Chinese nor completely Overseas Chinese. This suggests, therefore, that these films were completely or selectively forgotten when current mainstream Mainland Chinese film history, Hong Kong/Taiwan film history, and Singaporean and Malaysian film history were written.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201503-201509030009-201509030009-103-148,20,2015,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Modernity and Contemporary Dance in Taiwan: From Obsession with ＂China＂ to Obsession with ＂Formosa＂,Yuh-Jen Lu,"Formosa signi fier, propaganda documentary, indigenous song and dance, China signifier, modernity","Dance documentaries often refer to works of realistic, genuine, and already past performance events, perhaps to inform the viewers for various purposes, whereas propaganda aims at social engineering for the government’s own benefit. Prior to the 1970s, dance in Taiwan was rarely documented in film, except in political propaganda. Until the 1990s, the most comprehensive documentaries on contemporary dance in Taiwan were still for the purpose of political propaganda. This essay examines two propaganda dance documentaries, entitled ＂Three Faces of Chinese Dance＂ (1968) and ＂A Dancing Feast: A Documentary on Taiwan Choreography＂ (1995). Since the lifting of the 38-year long period of Martial Law in 1987 happened to be the defining event that separated the earlier documentary from the later one, it is assumed to have had different impacts on the two films, despite both being issued by the same ROC Government Information Office. Thus, under these particular situations in Taiwan, how was dance mobilized to reinforce the concept of the nation-state? What eidetic imagery marking the social changes, ethnic relations, and appearances of modernity in Taiwan can be seen from these two dance documentaries? When dance is playing the role of propaganda, what information is revealed through these two documentaries by means of mimesis and diegesis? In terms of these two ideological states, pre and post-martial law, dance artists seem to continue to take their cues from a nationstate point of view. Whether to resist, dodge, or follow the censored clues, they have only considered ＂serious＂ choreography as their subjects. Through Agnes Heller’s ＂logics of modernity＂ and the filmed presences of modern Chinese dance as well as indigenous song and dance within the respective two dance documentaries, I argue that ideologies derived from a search for modernity in Taiwan's contemporary dance works have moved from an obsession with ＂China＂ signifier to an obsession with ＂Formosa＂ signifier.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201403-201509010007-201509010007-7-52,18,2014,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Dynamics of Open Database Art,"Wen-Ting Hsu, Wen-Shu Lai","Intertextuality, Database art, Dynamics, Net art, Open work","With the pervasion of digital technology and the Internet, artists today can create artwork by programming and inputting external data. The subject of this paper, open database art (ODA), is one such type of artwork. Open database artwork, unlike other artwork, does not consist of fixed, preset, and stable content, because it is made by retrieving external data in different sociocultural contexts or by participants’ contributions, and the retrieved data is combined to form content. This type of artwork reflects both the application of database technology and the tendency toward collective creation in the digital age. With the continual input of external data, open database artworks create moving content, changing visual appearance, and overarching relationships. These characteristics of ODA result in a dynamic relationship between the external data and the open database artwork, the transformation of the meaning of the external data, and the reconfiguration of the artwork. Four conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) The continual open input of content is the main concept from the artist. The most characteristic approach of ODA is to involve external texts and viewer participation. (2) To better address the creation of ODA, the intertextuality in and between texts must be considered. (3) Along with the continual open input of content, a changing visual appearance, a moving textual relationship, the transformation of the meaning of the external data, and the reconfiguration of the artwork are also produced. (4) ODA is an ongoing event of art praxis. The artwork itself is a continual process, not a fixed object.

A Research on Chen Yingzhen’s Theological Thought through His Literary and Political Expressions,Hsiao-Hui Chang,"Earthly/Heavenly, Christian Realism, Marxism, Chen Yingzhen","Chen Yingzhen’s works show a serious concern over social issues in Taiwan, as is revealed by his theological thoughts. In his fiction as well as essays, one finds not only biblical history and Christian doctrines, but also his views on the narrative styles of the New Testament and his feeling about the Old Testament prophets' passion and urgency in bringing back a wayward people to God -- all showing Chen's familiarity with the Bible. Though he is a Marxist, Chen never entirely rejects Christian faith. In fact, Jesus’ love for the sick and disabled inspires him to work hard on behalf of his fellow people. Chen questions God, criticizes the government, and expresses his anxiety, indignation and loneliness in his writings, although such expressions of sentiments often meet with silence. Many scholars have analyzed Chen’s personality and identity as embodied in his literary works and his life, but have overlooked his religious experiences. Reading the Bible and joining Sunday school (though he quit it early in life), however, has had a great influence on Chen. For a Christian, politics belongs to the secular world, while faith belongs to the Heavenly Kingdom.

Transformations and Reconstruction of Lieu de Mémoire: A Study on the creation of la Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration in France,Jui-Hua Chen,"ethnographic museum, immigration museum, metonymy between time and space, representation of immigration, lieux de mémoire","The article aims to study how France, a former colonial empire, tries to redefine the national identity and to govern the immigration issue in the age of globalization, through the rearrangement of existed ethnographic museums and the creation of the national immigration museum(la Cité nationale de l'histoire de l'immigration, CNHI). Immigration museum and ethnographic museum are analyzed as two kinds of representations of such relationships. The concept created to interpret the transformation of such relationships is ＂the metonymy between time and space＂, which means a way of defining the relationship between self and others through the substitution between time and space. The mission of CNHI is to recognize immigrants and to change people's perspective towards them. Changing the perspective towards immigrants results in changing the vision about France. What is intended to be told in the immigration museum is not the immigration history as a part of social history, but the history of France based on the immigration history. Inspired by the case of CNHI, I differentiate ＂the ethnic museum＂ from ＂the immigration museum＂. The narration of the ethnic museum is based on the continuity and the development of a certain ethnic group. In contrast, the narration of the immigration museum bases on the land and the nation is used as the main frame for such narration, so as to relativize each ethnic group in the narration of immigrant nation. Nevertheless, the core concern of the immigration museum is not about the territory of the nation state, but peoples who have come to live in this land in different periods of time. The key implication of discussing the immigration museum resides in understanding ＂what is the immigrant society＂. The migration museum incarnates the self/other relationships in the age of globalization. The ＂self＂ goes abroad and becomes the other, while people from far land become members of our society. Migration is the process in which ＂self＂ becomes the other, and the other gradually becomes part of us.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201309-201501270048-201501270048-7-44,17,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
＂I felt... the ghost of my father＂: Trauma and Translation in Atom Egoyan's A Portrait of Arshile and Ararat,Juey-Fu Hsiao,"(counter-)transference, dark room, post-memory, Narchtraglichkeit (after effect), A Portrait of Arshile, translation, Ararat, pragma, Atom Eyoyan","Human beings in the last century have accomplished great things but we have also caused irreversible damage and harm to all forms of life. Genocide is one such example of atrocities on a scale unprecedented in previous human history. Armenian-Canadian director Atom Egoyan's Ararat (2002), since its release, has aroused debates and accusations in terms of sacrificing historical truth for the sake of aesthetic effect. As the first internationally produced and distributed full-length film about Armenian genocide (1915-1923), the critical opinions and debates are to be expected, since the anxiety and the following question is always there: Can speeches, words, and images sufficiently represent, interpret, and translate the referred object or event? On the other hand, as the survivors and people who experienced the genocide first hand gradually faded away, Ararat seems to be more concerned with the after effect caused by the denial of Armenian genocide. Thus, this film, involving Armenian Diaspora and other ethnic groups in the context of multiculturalism in Canada, launches the quest for and examines the multiple meanings of the so-called ＂cultural heritage.＂ Egoyan and Ian Balfour in their collaborated work, Subtitles: on the Foreignness of Films, point out succinctly, ＂[e]very film is a foreign film, foreign to some audience somewhere-and not simply in terms of language.＂ This makes us wonder what it means to Egoyan by translation, why we need translation, and how the subject and object are both changed and transformed in the process of translating. To try and figure out the answers to these questions, we need to adopt an interdisciplinary strategy to connect (1) the conception of translation that strives to preserve the foreignness of/in language (e.g. Water Benjamin and Paul Ricoeur's theory on translation), (2) Andrew Benjamin's philosophical reflections on words and meaning in relation to translation, and (3) Jean Laplanche's insistence on the unconscious as the ＂à traduire＂ (to translate/to be translated). Finally, by invoking Marianne Hirsh's concepts of ＂post-memory＂ and ＂familial looking＂ as supportive argument, I will read and discuss A Portrait of Arschile and some key scenes in Ararat to highlight that the possible answers to the previous questions may lie/hide in the dialogue between Raffi and Celia when Raffi visited her at the detention center. The event in and surrounding the dark room mentioned in their dialogue may be an allegory for film-viewing and remembrance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201309-201501270048-201501270048-45-86,17,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Feminine Sublime: Lee Miller's War Photography,Jui-Ch'i Liu,"the matrixial gaze, the feminine sublime, Lee Miller, war photography, Holocaust, ruins","Lee Miller (1907-1977) is famous for the pictures she took during World War Two. This paper concentrates on her photographs of the London Blitz in 1940 and her photographs of the damaged bodies of the soldiers and of the dead bodies of the holocaust from 1944 to 1945. In the past fifteen years, scholars have been dealing with Miller's war photography with polemic perspectives. Some scholars think that Miller attempts to highlight the difference between the spectator and the image through alienation effects. Others assert that Miller tends to evoke empathic concern of the spectator to the scene. This paper is going to reconcile these apparently contradictory points of view. My discourse, based on visual analyses, will appropriate theories of the feminine sublime established by Barbara Claire Freeman and other feminist scholars, as well as the theory of the matrixial gaze proposed by Bracha Lichtenberg Ettinger, in order to explore Miller's special way of perceiving the war traumas. My argument is that the aesthetics and ethics of the feminine sublime in Miller's photographs are different from Edmund Burke's conceptualization of the sublime in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757). Burke cliams that the spectator, while approaching the sublime, remains a protecting distance from the awful source in order to control it. However, when the spectator experiences Miller's works, s/he is not able to celebrate the self's capacity to master the threatening war traumas through a state of detachment. The spectator, within the experience of the sublime, neither possesses nor merges with the other, but attests to a relation in-between the detachment to and the identification with the other. S/he opens herself to and show respect for the alterity of the other without an intention to domesticate it. Miller's cultivation of the aesthetics and ethics of the feminine sublime is not only a feminist practice of looking, but could also evoke all anti-war spectators to perceive the destructive traumas caused by the collusion of the patriarchy with war through beholding the feminine sublime.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201309-201501270048-201501270048-87-122,17,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"＂Packing the Luggage＂, Check-in for the Journey: On the Politics of Mobility of ＂Traveller-Luggage＂",Chia-Ling Lai,"politics of mobility, everydayness, mobility, materiality, Luggage","Luggage, the necessary attachment and burden of travellers in their journey, seems to be mundane and simply, is actually no less complicated than a temporary home and prosthetic limbs on the move. In fact, the 'traveller-luggage' assembly not only reveals the time-space imagination of traveller's itinerary, choices of transportation, plots of their performance kept in the tourist photos, but also special tactical practices to confront the border security-checking which embodied the emerging surveillance society. 'Packing the luggage', relating to how to deal with materiality in the liquid age, is an annoyingly trivial and repetitive practice every traveller must tackle with. Owing to its banal everydayness, renders it a missing jigsaw piece of tourism studies which emphasis mainly on the extra-ordinariness. Drawing upon John Urry's theories of multiple mobilities that integrated with ANT, based on the empirical research on a transnational community in England, this paper explores how travellers organize their luggage as important belongings based on the multiple consideration of their journey and the politics emerged when encountering airport security. It also analyzes how travellers organise their luggage, as to curate a little moving museum: luggage reveals travellers' imagination of their journey, tactic manipulation to confront the expected surveillance, arranging liquid materiality topographically, mutual constitution of subjects and objects, as well as the performance of the taste of travellers in terms of the aesthetics of speed. This paper thus aims to reveal the politics of mobility, through studying the practices of packing as the intersection between banal everyday practices and extraordinary experience making as well as the micro tactics when encountering the macro border-crossing security checking.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201309-201501270048-201501270048-123-158,17,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

This study uses the ethnography approach from science and technology studies to examine the fastfollowing training in an university laboratory team. In contrast to industrial sociology's focus on industrial and policy regimes and the education studies' normative perspective, this paper argues that such an on-site approach of laboratory studies can offer alternative implication. This paper explores what kinds of talent are made in the training process. Based on the concern of the late-comer situation in Taiwan this study constructs a framework for locating these late-comer laboratory practices. In contrast to the others, the 'fast-following' culture of training and practice makes students team-obeying and self-disciplinary practitioners, who are good at industrious replication rather than innovative exploration. Accordingly, in order to tackle the crisis we also have to transform the research and educational regime.

The History of Chuangchungdao: Time and Immanent Ethics in Wu He's Remains of Life,Yu-Lin Lee,"simultaneity, We He, event, immanent ethics, the Wushe Incident, topography, real history","This paper focuses on the issues of time and ethics in Wu He's acclaimed novel ＂Remains of life＂. Wu He is known for his idiosyncratic writing. This novel, with its unique style, portrays the Wushe Incident that occurred in 1930. The narrator as one of the protagonist returns to Chuangchungdao, the resettled place of the related aborigines after the Incident, to trace its history by revisiting the landscape and investigating individuals who are associated with the Incident. The author regards this investigation as ＂historical research of the present.＂ However, such historical research neither intends to recover the repressed historical memoires nor seeks historical ＂truth＂; rather, it casts rethinking of the Incident, an ethical event that operates in a complex temporal structure of ＂simultaneity,＂ as the author understands it. Thus this paper attempts to analyze how the author understands the Wushe Incident and how power-relations have been stratified in the both the landscape and historical discourse concerning the Incident. Also, this paper explicates how the author's unique presentation of the Incident has actually reshaped the conception of history and introduced an ethics through his peculiar use of language.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201303-201501270047-201501270047-7-46,16,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Prostitution, Sexual Initiation and Masculinity: A Peculiar Aspect of Sexual Politics in Postwar Taiwanese Literature",Elliott S. T. Shie,"sexual initiation, Yang Qingchu, Wang Zhenhe, prostitution, Hou Hsiao-hsian, realism","According to the writer Zhang Dachun, the novel enjoys the freedom to invent alternative knowledge and challenge the social norms that have been taken for granted. From this perspective, Postwar Taiwanese literature with its realistic impulse is deemed to be conservative. Nonetheless, the social norms of the past that realistic literature has recorded could turn out to be rather alternative and challenging to the readers at the present. In Hou Hsiao-hsia's film A Time to Die A Time to Live (1985), Wang Zhenhe's ＂Sulan is Getting Married＂ (1985), and Yang Qingchu's ＂A Male Virgin＂ (1969) prostitution is a legitimate social institution wherein prostitutes perform the ritual of sexual initiation for male virgins while the males often suffer sexual anxiety and problems in need of experienced women's help. This conception of prostitution thus challenges the stereotype of prostitutes as either powerless victims under the rule of patriarchy or unredeemable sexual deviants with the false consciousness of consumerism. Because of their commitment to realism, these three texts ironically provide alternative knowledge to our commonsense and challenge the mainstream discourse about prostitutes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201303-201501270047-201501270047-47-80,16,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Zhang Tai-Yan's ＂Insanity＂: Affect, Survival and Revolutionary Knowledge",Jen-Peng Liu,"shenjing bing, insanity, epileptic, revolutionary, brain disease, Zhang Tai-Yan","This paper attempts to provide a new way to understand the life and work of radical intellectual Zhang Tai Yan (1869-1936) by rethinking ＂insanity＂ as both an experiential standpoint and an overlooked impetus for the development of revolutionary knowledge and affect. When giving a speech in Japan in 1906, Zhang Tai-yan used the unlikely term ＂shenjing bing＂ (literally nerve disease, but meaning insanity or, more colloquially, a person who is ＂psycho＂) to evoke the spirit of revolutionary knowledge and affect. This paper provides a preliminary study of the meanings of ＂shenjing bing＂ from the late 19th to early 20th century. The paper then reads Zhang as a ＂shenjing bing＂ in two ways, as a revolutionary and as a person with a ＂brain disease＂ (he was epileptic). Through this double reading, the paper attempts, first, to articulate (rather than avoid) the concrete, embodied experience of ＂shenjing bing.＂ Second, ＂shenjing bing＂ is explored as a discursive position, a speaking site where Zhang's experiential, political and social groundings converge in an epistemological standpoint.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201303-201501270047-201501270047-81-124,16,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Her works of multimedia video has attracted international attentions since the late 1980s. Rist uses an individual artistic language of irony and humor to blur boundaries between the visual art and the popular culture. Sex, gender and human bodies, especially women bodies, are the motifs she prefers. Even her own body appears also often in her works. She mentioned several times that her works try to show ＂hysteria＂ in a positive light. Hysteria was thought in the 19th century as a characteristic disease of women. Jean-Martin Charcot's and Sigmund Freud's research on it caused a sensation not only in the medical domain, but also subsequently in surrealism art and feminism. What is hysteria? Why and how does hysteria become an aesthetic form in Rist's art. This paper focuses on the theme of hysteria and goes into a detailed study on the theme hysteria in Rist's works of self-presentation: their styles and concepts will be scrutinized to find out the similarities and differences between Rist's art and the tradition of the surrealism art.

By tracing the formation of correlation between cleanliness, lighting, good ventilation, hygiene and health in contrast to filth, staleness, dampness and illness as formulated in slum narratives, this paper proposes an economy of morality implanted in Victorian cognition of sanitation. The keen awareness of the possible intimidation to human health and public welfare is materialized and medicalized in detailed description of corruption of life habit and the degradation of the quality of living environment. Dickens' city slum becomes a place most promising for unseen and unpredicted dangers and the arena most likely for any social movement and policymaking to take place. As a result, an economy of medical realism and health normatism is thereby established in witnessing everyday life practices in urban slums and weighing the threat to public health. Health, as a result, becomes a malleable and manageable issue in safeguarding all normal and disregarding all abnormal practices in everyday life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201303-201501270047-201501270047-173-218,16,2013,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Situating the official AIDS policy within the context of the post-martial law geopolitics, I mark out the 'sexual orientation' of national AIDS pedagogy as one that orientates the national body towards the monogamous ideal while steering it away from the diseased sexual tropics. Further, I look into the affective directive of such orientation organised under the rhetoric of love by showing how glocalised objects such as the quilt and the waterlily lantern come to be massively sentimentalised. With the Red Ribbon morphed into the circle of humanity that claims, as a gesture of social inclusion, to safeguard people living With AIDS/HIV, I elucidate how this affective climate of compassion is nothing but a product of a melancholic state that fosters intense sexual moralism. Finally, this essay offers a politics of mourning and remembrance as enacted by people living with HIV/AIDS themselves, in order to contest the national imagination that forecloses the historicity of the AIDS body from its futurity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201209-201402270019-201402270019-9-42,15,2012,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Based on this study, the essay tackles Frida Kahlo's illness narrative to examine the construction of the disabled as vulnerable subject or super(wo)man subject, and by doing so, it intends to neutralize the dehumanizing effects of societal discriminations against the disabled. The essay examines Kahlo's letters, diary, and paintings to access her unique psychic lives and subjectivity, with special emphasis on her feelings of experiencing the other or the abject. Indeed, Kahlo's life writing can be also read as pathography. Her body, wounded, pierced, or distorted, however, is not only the center of agony but also the ideal place for sublimation and transcendence.

This overlapping is present in the ethnographic film festival in Taiwan, which addresses the objectives and implications of visual media, publicized anthropological knowledge, and public anthropology. Through participant observation of the Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival, 2001 to 2009, this article focuses on how the film festival launch a variety of representation-event, and how it relies on diverse strategies including educational, advocate, and reflective approaches to elaborate on the concerns and dimensions of public anthropology. The film festival provides a communicative space wherein audience, filmmakers, and film characters are co-present. It is an effective way for the public to reflect together on the historical experiences of ethnic interaction and learn the contestation of different representations, memories, and narratives.Public anthropology is concerned about popularization of anthropological knowledge and the encounters with audience during the process of popularization. Public anthropology pointed out the institutionalized nature and concealed service objects of anthropological knowledge; it also revealed the discipline's core presumptions and power relations of knowledge production. The 2007 Taiwan International Ethnographic Film Festival used ”Indigenous Voice” as the theme, in an attempt to the work of indigenous people who were the previous audience as well as the shooting objects. Celebrating the phenomenon of aboriginals filming themselves, the festival challenges the established framework of anthropological knowledge and ethnographic film. Moreover, it observes the real effect of aboriginal voices, talk-back, and empowerment through introducing, showing, and discussing indigenous films.

War over Death Penalty: Legal Anthropology's Engagement,Shaw-Wu Jung,"death penalty, public anthropology, legal anthropology, justice, human rights","Public anthropology may be seen as a new way that produces and distributes anthropological knowledge, and it also reflects the acknowledgement among anthropologists that the anthropological knowledge could have contributed more to the issues relevant to the public interests. This article takes the case of the debates over the death penalty and demonstrates the extent legal anthropology may engage in the debates by putting up new questions for different parties involved. I argue that the major theme underlying the abolition of death penalty is one of human rights and democracy, which is Western derived, and this creates difficulty in translating it to the public. Instead, legal anthropology bases its findings on ethnographic investigation and comparison, thereby being able to connect indigenous legal knowledge into the public forum such that the popular and the Western belief may be in a channel of communication to reshape the debates over the death penalty. In this regard, I propose two new questions legal anthropology can do to bring to attention to the public. One is being able to close to the belief systems within culture (especially with regard to life and death).

"Secret Trauma Going Public: Testimonial Narratives of Taiwanese ""Comfort Women"" as Healing Scenes",Jen-Yu Peng,"healing, testimonial narrative, Comfort women, psychoanalysis, historical trauma, publicization","In February 1992, the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) set up a complaint hotline searching for former ”comfort women” in Taiwan, allowing the historical trauma kept in secret for half a century to enter into public space. From 2007, I started a fieldwork on the ”Psycho-physical Caring Workshop for 'Ah-Ma'” (formerly known as ”Psychotherapy Workshop for Comfort Women”) organized by TWRF since 1996. Based on a psychoanalytical approach, my initial intention was to interrogate how the dialectic relationship between personal history and collective History would affect subject's understanding of one's own traumatic experience. Through this ”clinical fieldwork”, I unexpectedly discovered the crucial role played by the publicization of traumatic narratives in social mobilization. I have then been focusing my observations on two levels of mobilization around the Comfort women issue: firstly, the transnational advocacy movement looking for international recognition and urging the Japanese government to take its postwar responsibility by delivering formal apology and compensation to the victims; secondly, the social care and psychological treatment provided by TWRF to the ”Grandmas”, mostly living in poor condition. Based on these observations, I will describe and analyze some major scenes in the publicizing process of comfort women's stories, showing how these old ladies learned from public appearances settled by NGOs to move from the position of ”victim” to that of ”survivor” and ”witness”. Furthermore, I will discuss if the going public has facilitated healing or, on the contrary, impeded it. To sum up, by re-examining the formation of comfort women's narrative, I intend to highlight the importance of subject's recognition and historical inscription, both pivotal for psychoanalytic understanding of trauma. That might offer clinical practitioners another path to consider symptoms and healing, and to bring psycho-trauma back to social relational context.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201209-201305060008-201305060008-139-196,14,2012,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Making the Code of Ethics Public and a Priority: The Cases of US and Taiwan Anthropologies,Shao-Hua Liu,"Taiwan anthropology, public anthropology, code of ethics, ethical review, American anthropology","This article reveals the problem of publicness during the establishment of ethical oversight of human research in Taiwan. Through examining the development of anthropological codes of ethics in the United States and Taiwan, we come to understand the particular concerns of anthropology in these two societies, and that insight helps us reckon with the significance and constraints of institutionalizing research ethical oversight. Anthropology generally reminds scholars of their individual responsibility to grapple with ethical challenges in the context of cultural difference and social change. Constantly reflecting on the disciplinary cores, understanding the subaltern, and remaining sensitive to cultural difference constitute the fundamental ethical guidance of anthropology. The anthropological code of ethics should become the essence when making the discussion on research ethics public.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201209-201305060008-201305060008-197-228,14,2012,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
On the Rhetorical Turn of Interpretive Anthropology with Regard to Its Comments and the Contemporary Challenges of Globalization,Hsu-Ta Lin,"globalization, interpretive anthropology, ethnographic allegory, anthropological irony, surrealism","This essay elucidates the cross-disciplinary appropriations of interpretive anthropology and its rhetoric interests, thereby responding to the current critical comments and the contemporary challenges of globalization. Drawing on the Geertzian initiation, interpretive anthropology, rather than a specialty or subdiscipline, is a hermeneutic discipline as a vehicle of meaning toward the very center of anthropological reproduction. The rhetorical turn of interpretive anthropology then comes to deconstruct the subjectivity of ethnographic writing, and to examine the authorial self-doubt on moral hypochondria in writing. Illuminated by the rhetoric perceptions in literatures, the interpretive anthropology therefore motivates self-reflexivity as an autocritique which shifts the methodological craft of fieldwork to a subject of ontology, reevaluates the authority of ethnographic writing, and reveals the idea of anthropological irony as well as the superimposed allegorical meanings. The ethnographic surrealism additionally reinforces the tension of irony and destabilization, by means of juxtaposition, collage and defamiliarization, thus challenging the stereotypically fixed understanding of cultural order and social values. The rhetorical turn of interpretive anthropology hence sheds light on the sensibility of cultural diversity undergoing globalization and the selfawareness during the production of ethnographic knowledge.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201209-201305060008-201305060008-229-272,14,2012,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Facing the Sea, Becoming the West: The Imagination of Maritime Nation and the Discourse of Asia in Japan",Hung-Yueh Lan,"Japan, sea power, discours e of Asia, the West, maritime nation","When European maritime powers occupied most of sea spaces, they began to trade with Asian countries, and gradually to colonization of large areas of land in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the meantime, the border was invented in the Asia, and a few Japanese intellectuals gradually started to argued about the border of Japan, to recognize Japan's characteristics and advantages as a maritime nation (海國).And they imaged Japan as a maritime nation as a way to make differences from China. So In the 18th century, a few Japanese intellectuals who imaged Japan as a maritime nation no longer imitated the political and military systems of continental nations (陸國, notably China); rather, they took the Western maritime powers as a model to build the nation and expand territories. In this sense, to imagine Japan itself as a maritime nation was a step, or maybe a turning point, in Japan's attempt to de-Asianize (Escape from Asia, 脫亞), also, it was a step in the development of the Asianism (especially of those expansionist thoughts of Asianism).That is to say, the cultural border between Europe and Asia was invented by the modern Japanese intellectuals, at the same time, they break the border of the Asian nations to become the west. So In this paper, I would like to argue that Japan's imagination of being a maritime nation was an important factor in Asianism's emergence in modern Japan. For this purpose, I will examine the discourses of Japanese intellectuals concerned with building up Japan as a maritime nation from the 18th century. And then I will discuss Afred Thayer Mahan's sea power theory served as one of the factors that lead to the emphasis on military overseas expansion in Japan's (expanisionist) Asiaism. At last, as China is urging to get the sea power of the Asia-Pacific region, want to rebuild China as a maritime nation recently. I will discuss the conflict of the two maritime nations in the border of seas.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201209-201305060008-201305060008-273-315,14,2012,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Calling the Hidden Name of the Female Dandy?: Berenice Abbott's Portrait Photographs of the Lesbian Writers in the 1920s,Jui-Ch'i Liu,"social network, reception, female dandy, portrait photography, production, Berenice Abbott","Berenice Abbott (1898-1991) took portrait photographs of American lesbian writers of the Left Bank Paris in the 1920s. These famous portraits, as illustrations, appear in many books, journals, and films, but no articles have examined their historical, social, and cultural significations. This paper explores how these portraits construct the social subjectivities of these lesbian writers from the perspectives of production and reception. After investigating historical materials on these lesbian writers, I discover a hidden fact which has not been pointed out by photography scholars. Abbott's lesbian clients came from the same social networks of the Left Bank. My interpretations of these portraits are based on a re-construction of these social networks.Abbott produced the public images of these lesbian writers donning short hair, masculine suits and accessories. I trace the genealogy the female dandy from the late 19th century to the 1920s, which has been acknowledged by scholars only on a piecemeal basis, in order to interpret such public images. I analyze how Abbott colluded with these lesbian writers to produce their self-representations as female dandies through reinterpretating and expanding the images of the dandies in the 19th century? I also explore how the spectators might have received these portraits of female dandies, which tuned into their public images through the expansion of social networking?Was the imagery of the female dandy the mark of the lesbians in Paris and London in the 1920s? Feminist scholars, from Shari Benstock to Laura Doan, have had a dramatic debate on this issue. In the middle of the 1980s, Benstock claimed that ”[t]he most pervasive image of lesbianism in these years is of women who appear at first glance to be male.” At the end of the 1990s, Doan, challenging Benstock's line of thinking, emphasized that one could not tell if female masculinity was the mark of the lesbians in Paris and London from 1918 to 1928. I respond to this debate through reading Abbott's portraits of female dandy from the perspective of reception. My thesis is that these portraits constructed these lesbian writers' social subjectivities that shifted between visibility and invisibility. By the strategy of the passing fashion, these portraits called those who knew how to read the lesbian codes of female dandyism to see these writers' lesbian identity. However, for those who did not know how to look at the lesbian codes of female dandyism, these portraits only exhibited elegant, chic, and modern women writers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201110-201210310001-201210310001-7-56,13,2011,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

"The ""Latinamerica"" in Li Chen's Poetry: An Investigation into the Cross-Cultural and Intertexual Translation",Cheng-Fan Chen,"modern poetry, Li Chen, cultural translation, Latin America","A number of Taiwanese authors can write, comment on, and translate poetry. However, Li Chen, among others, is probably the only one who translates poetry with different origins, covering Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. Li Chen's translations cross national boundaries, and his own works (including music, painting, and foreign literature) also cross various cultures. With the rise of global civilization, Li Chen's works deserve more critical attention owing to his integration of various cross-cultural topics, innovative experimentation on the form, and great concern about women, minority groups, and the third world.Li Chen's works have been discussed from the perspectives of postmodernism and postcolonialism. Exhibiting both local and avant-garde features, Li Chen's works have constructed the spectacle of Taiwanese poetics. However, through the interpretative lens of cross-culturalism, we discover something more than local and avant-garde in Li Chen's works. Starting with the discussion of Li Chen's substantial translations of Latin American poetry, this article examines how Li Chen's translations influence his creative writing.Li Chen regards his experience of translating Latin American poetry leads him to mimic and transform the poems. This article seeks to address the following questions. How can we explicate Li Chen's attempt of transferring Latin American culture into Taiwanese literature as a way to break the myth of treating Americanization as Internationalization? After cultural translations, how does Li Chen create the unique features of his poetry by appropriating and rewriting Latin American poetry? Which perspective of comparative culture can be generated from examining Li Chen's translated poems and his own works? By analyzing Li Chen's poetry translation and creation, we hope to construct Li Chen's cross-cultural and intertextural poetics.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201110-201210310001-201210310001-81-128,13,2011,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The First Contact of Protestants and Siraya: On Arminianists' Missionary Work in Formosa between 1627 and 1643,Hsiao-Hui Chang,"Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, Siraya, Protestantism, Formosa, Arminianism, or VOC)","The Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, or VOC) landed in Dayuan on Formosa in 1624 in order to establish a base for conducting trade in China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. At first, the VOC only maintained a stronghold in Dayuan. However, Formosa's fertile land and abundance of fish and deer prompted the company to expand its operations. Expansion required developing friendly relations with aborigines on the island, a task which fell to Dutch missionaries sent by the VOC. It was through these missionaries that Christian teachings first reached Formosa. Doctrinal disputes within Dutch Protestantism between Calvinism and Arminianism deeply affected missionary work in Formosa. Most of the missionaries who arrived between 1627 and 1643 were Arminianists. During this period, the missionaries' first task was to develop written script for aboriginal languages so that aborigines could read Christian texts. Through learning written forms of their languages, aborigines were exposed to Christian teachings and many were baptized as Christians. This paper examines the religious and cultural backgrounds of both Dutch settlers and indigenous peoples in 17th century Formosa and the hybrid Dutch/indigenous culture that emerged through the process of aboriginals' conversion to Christianity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201110-201210310001-201210310001-129-162,13,2011,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

From War Memories to Memory Wars: Literary Representations of Memories of World War II in Taiwan and Okinawa,Huei-Chu Chu,"Okinawa War, postwar responsibility, war responsibility, war memories, Taiwanese Japanese-soldier","This paper deals with literary representations of memories of world war II in three novels, including Taiwanese writer Song Ze-Lai's ”The Last War” (1976), Chen Ying-Zhen's ”The Zhong-Xiao Park” (2001), and Okinawa writer Medoruma Shun's ”Droplet” (1997), exploring how Taiwanese and Okinawa writers intervene in the heated debates on war and postwar responsibility in East Asia. Through divergent writings of East Asian war memories and memory wars, how do these novels demonstrate the historical predicaments of Taiwan and Okinawa? How do the issues of war memories intersect and entangle with postwar national identities? Locating three literary texts in historical contexts, this paper analyzes the condition in which war memories of Taiwanese Japanese-soldiers and Okinawa inhabitants are in danger of being incorporated into Japan's national war narrative, as a consequence of emphasizing their contributions ”fighting as Japanese” in the debates of war and postwar responsibility. This paper argues that as ambivalent and confused historical subjects, the very existence of Taiwanese Japanese-soldiers and Okinawa inhabitants have disturbed the singular alignment of body, nationality, and war, and therefore problematize their bodies ”fighting as Japanese,” challenging national war narratives and politics of war memories in East Asia. Furthermore, the historical dynamics of these ”non-state” bodies also connect to the possibility for Taiwanese Japanese-soldiers and Okinawa inhabitants to cross national demarcations and share historical experiences and traumatic memories of war with other minority people, and work together to resist wartime and postwar violence in the name of nationalism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201109-201203030072-201203030072-11-42,12,2011,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Firstly, based on a study of the evolution of resistance images, the author argues that the shift of the narrative strategy is the replacement of premodern subjects with modern subjects, which is in fact a reflection of the idea of ”the rise of the great nation”. Secondly, the author will track, with reference to Lu Xun's ”The Slide Event”, the psychological journey of a Japanese soldier named Kadokawa from invasion to massacre to breakdown to suicide, demonstrating the relationship between modern subjects' self-criticism and the inborn violence of modernity. Thirdly, considering the violence of modernity befallen to the Chinese was mainly from Japan, and the wounds of Asia also the wounds of modernity, the author claims that the Japanese or Otherness perspective is, against the background of territorial integration of East Asia, an attempt to heal the trauma resulting from the Sino-Japanese wars. As such, City of Life and Death plays a twofold function in integration, internally reversing the sad strategy adopted in the 1980s while externally healing the wounds of modernity/Asia.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201109-201203030072-201203030072-43-71,12,2011,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Once this possibility can be admitted, it becomes imperative to explore the notion that discontinuities between cultures are not distinct to one particular culture but may in fact be managed through a common technique or practice.

Philosophical Life and Critical Ascetics: Reflections on the Notion of the Subject in the Late Foucault,Fabian Heubel,"Cynicism, Michel Foucault, askesis, arts of existence, subjectivity","This paper consists of three parts. The first part is an experimental approach to ”homosexual ascesis”, the second part retraces the shaping of Foucault's notion of ascesis (ascèse) by focusing on the relation between arts of existence (techne tou biou) and hermeneutics of the subject, the third part deals with Foucault's interpretation of Cynicism and the idea of radical philosophical life. In the first place, I want to clarify the theoretical background of Foucault's his claim for ”homosexual ascesis” and his understanding of certain sexual practices like S/M as creation of new pleasure, eroticization of power or as a game in which strategic relations are transformed into a source of pleasure. This perspective serves as entrance into Foucault's reflections on the subject of desire and the hermeneutics of the subject which have gradually lead him to turn away from a Christian notion of ”ascesis” as repression of desire or renunciation of the self and towards the elaboration of its contemporary significance. I try to show that the understanding of ascetic practices within Christianity as ”counterconduct” has been crucial for the move from the analysis of power to the arts of existence and philosophical life. Main reference of the third part are Foucault's lectures at the Collège de France on The Courage of Truth (1984) in which he explores philosophical life in Cynicism and what he calls Cynic ascesis. His understanding of Cynic ascesis as a radical and critical form of philosophical life makes it, finally, possible to understand the correspondence between Foucault's historical research into Greco-Roman philosophy and his quest for alternative practices of the self. In his discussion of Cynicism Foucault relates critique and ascesis in an innovative way which convincingly breaks with spiritual cultivation and the metaphysics of the soul.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201103-201110150008-201110150008-143-167,11,2010,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

The Fable of Intermittent Images: On Jacques Ranciere's Theses of Film Aesthetics,Song-Yong Sing,"intermittent images, thwarted fable, representative regime of art,  aesthetic regime of art, pure sensible images, Jacques Rancière","By using ”thwarted fable” in cinema, contemporary French thinker Jacques Rancière proposes a double play of coexisting and intermitting between ”representative regime of art” and ”aesthetic regime of art.” As a cinema that sustains ”the regime of the thought of arts”, the ambiguousness of its status quo lies in the moment when continuing and developing the collective classic model and content shared by other artistic prototypes, presenting the differentiation in pure sensible images of representative and narrative poetic, or the rigorous ”intermittent images”. Thus, Rancière connects the definition of cinematic aestheticism that refers to the distinctive expressions and model of creation philosophy with the artistic prototypes that practiced the aesthetic revolution since the time of Romanticism. For philosophers, this is a collective reference to ”regime of identification of art,” and, more than that, it also symbolizes the uniqueness of motion sound and image. The study considers that in philosopher's discourse on film aesthetics, ”intermittent images” are not only the miniature of imagery event co-constructed by narrative poetic and pure sensible, but also the human shaped substance misplaced in cineaste's creation philosophy, and the ”fable” witness of performing a ”post-sensible” examination toward nonhuman historical poetic through the latent variation of images. In other words, in the intertexture, latent diversity and dislocation as the experiments in film history and in the ”regime of identification of art,” ”intermittent images” as ”the power of film aesthetics” present the essential action of contemporary film analysis and theoretical study. Nevertheless, it characterizes a shifting capacity of formative co-construction and reconfiguration and outlines a general plan for the sketch of distinctive world; and further, it shapes the artistic philosophy of idealistic sensible model as well.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-201003-201106150006-201106150006-37-68,10,2010,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Therefore, with regard to its orient (ation), post-Said Orientalism has neither the Orient nor orientation, though Orientalism is founded on the absence of the Orient from the very beginning. But it does not mean that Orientalism no longer makes any sense; on the contrary, it always keeps a good sense: Orientalism as a metonym for all the dominant/ dominated relationship in the symbolic system of culture. The ”Orientalism” itself had better be considered as a traveling theory and a textual attitude developed among oriental scholars and others, including E. Said and post-Saidians from 19th century on.

Lévinas' ethical philosophy. Putting the Orient in the transcendent position of the absolute other, we reexamine the essentialized and fossilized relation of the Orient and the Occident.

"""Prosthetic Mobility"" for Everyone: Lessons from Moving Experiences of the Persons with Physical Disability",Chih-Hung Wang,"disability, technological object, mobility, prosthetics, mobility rights","This paper aims to problematize mobility through discussions of moving experiences and strategies of the persons with physical disability, and proposing the concept of ”prosthetic mobility” as a new approach. Substantially and symbolically, disability is often defined through demobility and vice versa. However, both disability and (de) mobility are products of human-social construction which cannot be ascribed to personal physical properties only. And we can learn much from disabled people's moving experiences and strategies. Firstly, the social constructed de-mobility makes these persons develop specific sensibility towards their physical capacities and the ”disabled” built environment. Furthermore, in view of their moving strategies, we can define mobility as the moving potential of the coordination of bodily capacities, technological objects, social relationships, message-knowledge, signifying practices, and spatial-temporal projects. This relational-constructional view of ”prosthetic mobility” emphasizes the roles played by strategic actions in the construction and realization of mobility and the formation of subjectivity in mobility. Finally, the author argues that everyone engages in ”prosthetic mobility” to grasp life chances and resources.

Firstly, I look into the abundant feminine tropes in Taiwan's postcolonial discourse in order to examine the feminine situation of Taiwan as a postcolonial subjectivity. Secondly, drawing on the contemporary phenomenology of body, I explore the horizon of the agency and materiality of the body and the land. Thirdly, I revisit the postcolonial debates more than a decade ago among Kuei-Fei Chiu, Chao-Yang Liao, and Hsien-Hao Liao, in order to re-articulate the complicated dynamic relationship among ”subject”, ”subject position”, ”subjectivization” and ”subject qua the void.” In the conclusion, I suggest a co-articulation of the ”feminine situation” and the ”subject qua void” to understand the space of Taiwan's postcolonial subjectivity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200906-201101060096-201101060096-5-44,9,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Archival Dream: A Discussion of Derrida's Archive Fever from a Musical Goof in Three Times,Ke-Min Lin,"dream, archive, cinema, Derrida, memory","When a director makes a film according to his life story, what memory does he intend to recall? Starting from a concern for a musical goof in the film Three Times, the article seeks to explore, by means of an approach based on the Derrida's ”archive fever”, the relationship between film and memory. According to Derrida, the memory that a film attempts to recall is definitely not ”real information”, but the invisible ”shadow archive” hidden behind the information. Finally, in terms of Derrida's discussion on the logic of dream, this article also points out that a film director cannot recall the memory he expects unless the film becomes his own dream.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200906-201101060096-201101060096-45-72,9,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
From the Revolution of Poetic Language to the Poetics of Cinema: On the Visuality in Russian Futurism and Formalism,Lik-Kwan Cheung,"Russian futurism, transrational language, Russian formalism, poetics of cinema, cinematic visuality in Modernist literature","Russian formalism is often considered as the pioneer in its scientific approach to problematic intrinsic to literature. In proposing literary studies as an autonomous field of research that aims for literature itself, rather than a subordinate of other subjects and purposes, the Russian formalists had established a new discipline, or guiding principle for literary studies. Contrary to such a stance generally held by academic mainstream, the present study situates the Russian formalists in a different position. Actually, there had been substantial exchange, historically, between Russian formalists' primary concerns of ”literariness/literality,” and the newly arisen cultural logic of cinematic images in early 20th century as well as the visual experiments of Cub-futurism. This paper reconsiders such historical converges and exchanges by ways of textual analysis, and in revisiting a great number of historical documents hitherto overlooked. In doing so, I attempt to offer a re-reading of Russian formalist theory by contextualizing its place in Soviet-Russian leftist avant-garde art movement, specifically that of Cub-futurism and Constructivism. Contextualization effort such as this should point out the close historical ties existed between the Russian formalists' quest for a paradigm shift in the domain of literary studies on one hand, and on the other the creative experimentations undertook by Soviet-Russian leftist avant-garde artists in various fields of visual arts, such as painting and film making. Lastly, my study aims to elucidate, albeit tentatively, the unique visual experience, or ”visuality” inherent in Russian formalist literary theories. Following this, the paper concludes with a discussion of the cultural-political significance that underlies leftist avant-garde art theories and practices in Soviet Russia.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200906-201101060096-201101060096-73-118,9,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"De/Re-territorialized Ximending: The Imagination and Construction of ""Quasi-Tokyo"" Consuming Landscapes",Ming-Tsung Lee,"landscape, cross-cultural consumption, Taipei Walker, Ximending, de/re-territorialization","This article argues against the prevailing thinking that celebrates deterritorialization by taking its superficial images such as ”borderlessness” or ”de-territoriality”, and then demonstrates that deterritorialization is not a linear/one-way process but a dialectical pushand-pull. As with the dialectic nexus of globalization and localization, where there is deterritorialization, there is also reterritorialization. The idea has been applied to my historical/ethnographical study of Taipei's Ximending. I explain how earlier Japanese colonists, later Chinese immigrants and recently young Taiwanese have successively practiced their culturalimaginative projects by imitating differently the distant Other's landscapes of consumption. Another case study, of the transnational production and crosscultural consumption of Taipei Walker magazine, follows. This explores the embedded Japanese consumerism in Taipei, particularly associated with today's Ximending.

The Translation of Ethics and the Question of Subjectivation: The Case of Wang Guowei,Joyce Chi-Hui Liu,"genealogy of ethics, Luo Zhenyu, topology of the subject, cultural translation, late Qing intellectuals, Wang Guowei","Wang Guowei's translations of utilitarian ethics and education theory reveal clearly the role that he played at Education World and as a Chinese intellectual. His participation in the public discourse fit into the plans of Luo Zhenyu both at the journal and later at the Ministry of Education of the late Qing government. The impact that Wang and Luo together produced on the Chinese intellectual world was profound. Those theories of ethics and education they introduced became the main axis of Chinese ethical thought throughout the 20(superscript th) century; they defined the terms in which the subject related to society or the state, However, Wang's translations of the texts of foreign theories were practiced on another level by a second act of translation on the conceptual level. During his exploration of the limits of Western and classical Chinese ethics, he found the limitations of dualism, and attempted to return to monist models of experience/knowledge. Moving back into the fields of aesthetics and ethics, he suggested a critique of utilitarianism and life-ism (shengsheng zhuyi) that was popular at the time. As well as a critique, he also developed a response: no-life-ism (wusheng zhuyi). This response transcends considerations of self-interest or the relationship of the self with the material world, and involves the ethics of reducing one's own partial volition. This is not a negative or pessimistic account of humanity. Via the appreciation of art, people may experience an objectification of human will in an aesthetic form, and informed by that experience, they can retreat from the position of the subject in an oppositional relationship with the material world; and they can reject utilitarian politics. Thus, Wang himself maintained a level of detachment and criticism concerning the politicized ethics of his contemporaries and Luo Zhenyu.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200903-201006230018-201006230018-9-60,8,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Culture of Hobby (pi): On the Grotesque Figure of Literati in the Ming-Ching Era,Der-Liang Chiou,"the idiosyncratic habit, grotesque aesthetic, degenerate taste, competition of taste, the hobby, amateur ideal, the addiction, pi the obsession","Pi (the obsession, the idiosyncratic habit, the hobby, the addiction)-the illness of not-being-ill, the taste of the degenerate taste, the supplement of being, and the useless habit for the social existence-becomes the indispensable condition of existence for those who have pi. It is perhaps a cultural appendix to the literati culture, but it is also a sine qua non for the construction of their figures. The attitude toward pi of Chinese literati had an obvious transformation in the Ming era. This transformation could be explained by the hypothesis to consider pi as the self expression of individualism in their social practices. This article examines this hypothesis by viewing the literati itself as a work of art, which is a cultural commodity produced in the socio-cultural field. In the Ming-Ching era (1500-1800), a mass of ”unofficial literati” failing in civil examinations formed a particular social class. Together with the officials and the merchants, they emulated the cultural taste and competed with one another, and thus a new scene in the cultural landscape was created.
These literati, whose cultural capital came from their cultural literacy, rivaled the officials by showing their amateur ideal of leisure aesthetic on the one hand, and rejected the merchants by negating their good will of culture learning on the other. They cultivated their pi in order to identify themselves and to maintain their privilege status. This practice of ”cultivation of pi” revealed the competition of taste. In one way, the cultivation of pi distinguished the literati from the common people with its unproductive uselessness. In the other way, the literati's pi displayed a symbolic cultural capital which distinguished the elegant from the vulgar and the true from the false. Thus, it further distinguished themselves from the merchants. Finally, they had to let their taste degenerate and become as grotesque as possible, and this uncanny aesthetic could separate the literati from the current culture dominated by the titled officials without leaving the mainstream culture. In this way, pi, which in Chinese also means ”to separate, to avoid, and to clear a path,” created another dominant taste.
This article tries to draw a history of the culture of pi and discusses the problematic of how the Ming- Ching literati performed their figure through their focus on pi? How did they, through the cultivation of pi, create themselves as a work of art? What image did this work of art have? What political and aesthetic actions did they display? Finally, when the civilizations of old society of the Ming and Ching Empires collapsed, what change was brought to this culture of pi?",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200903-201006230018-201006230018-61-100,8,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Rethinking Discourses on the Rise of China and its Limitations,Hung-Jeng Tsai,"globalization, flying geese system, rise of China, tributary system","The rise of China turns into a hot issue along with China's rapid growth of GDP, FDI, trade surplus and foreign reserve. The rightists explain China rise as the outcome of neo-liberal globalization, while the leftists interpret it as historical return of a Sino-centric tributary system. This article argues that both right and left perspectives have their orientalist blind spots in deciphering the phenomena of China rise. These blind spots prevent them from seeing China's high dependency on the U.S.-centered global market, a main character of East Asian flying geese pattern. However, due to its big size, China's continuous growth as a key condition for the rise of China has to rely on its domestic purchasing power rather than global market. As internal purchasing power is currently constrained by income inequality and lack of well-established welfare system, corresponding social reforms thus become crucial factors for the future of China rise.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200903-201006230018-201006230018-101-124,8,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Transcultural Critique and Philosophical Reflections on Chinese Modernity,Fabian Heubel,"New Confucian Manifesto, immanent transcendence, contemporary Neo-Confucianism, critical theory, Chinese modernity","This paper relates transcultural philosophy and Chinese modernity by addressing Frankfurt School Critical Theory and contemporary New Confucianism. There may be many reasons for being skeptical about New Confucianism but I try to argue that New Confucianism, no matter how conservative or idealistic it may be, is formed by an experience of transcultural dynamics obviously still lacking within European critical theory. Today it is still difficult to evaluate this radical aspect in New Confucianism because it seems to fall back sharply behind the anti-traditionalism of the Communist revolution. I doubt, however, whether this anti-traditionalism has not been based on a very partial understanding of Chinese modernity. Is not the potential of Chinese modernity rather to be located in an ability to learn from Western modernity but to avoid, at the same time, a radical break with the historical resources of Chinese culture? In other words, can the conditions of possibility to receive and transform Western modernity be traced back to these resources? The New Confucian Manifesto of 1958 argues that, confronted with the Chinese situation, it is necessary to undertake a double critique, which, on the one hand, critiques certain aspects of pre-modern China but, on the other side, is also critical about certain aspects of the modern West. The complexity of this position, which goes beyond the simple dichotomies of tradition and modernity or East and West, has been, for decades, cast aside by the violence of history. Now it begins, gradually, to reveal its farsightedness. In recent years, ”left” intellectuals in China have been trying to leave behind the blind negation of tradition and began to reevaluate classical Chinese Culture. The strong idealistic tendency in contemporary New Confucianism thus became a focus of critique. But when reading and interpreting New Confucian texts, one should not forget that those who, consciously and unconsciously, achieved a transcultural turn in Chinese philosophy, were modern Confucians with idealistic and metaphysical convictions. The Confucian Manifesto of 1958 shows that especially those, who insisted on the importance of classical Chinese culture, and criticized the anti-traditionalism of both communist and liberal intellectuals of the time, had no choice but to think about past, present and future of Chinese culture from a transcultural perspective.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200903-201006230018-201006230018-125-147,8,2009,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Away from Colony: On Sexual/National Consciousnesses in the Literary Texts of Xiao Hong,Heng-Hsing Liu,"women, left-wing, Xiao Hong, nation, May-Fourth","The literary works of Xiao Hong has proved perplexing to those working in the areas of feminism, national identity, and modernism.

Therefore, this paper explores the convictions of Xiao Hong towards Chinese women and ordinary people to determine the way in which she adapted cultural and traditional conceptions in support of various modern sociopolitical purposes and aims.

Shie,"prostitutes, Li Yongping, city, abject, flâneur","Through the concepts of flâneur and abject, this paper examines Li Yongping's Zhu Ling's Adventures in Wonderland, highlighting the heroine Zhu Ling as a female flâneur, the configuration of the sex industry, urban economy and the government, as well as the stereotypes of prostitutes and punters. Better than her male counterpart, Zhu Ling directly engages and negotiates with urban space, discovering its dangers and excitements at the same time. Through streetwalking, Zhu Ling, like a sociologist, reveals Janus's two faces of the sex industry-as a disdained abject and as a fascinating spectacle-and configures an erotic map loaded with contradictions. In the view of the government, prostitutes are immoral subjects whereas prostitution contributes to the development of urban economy. The sex industry thus becomes an abject from which the self-claimed moral government wishes to, but always fails to distinguish itself-the abject always comes back to haunt the subject. Similarly, although the prostitutes and their patrons appear as others vis-à-vis flâneur the subject, the fear of the temptresses may in fact reflect the weakness of the male subject and the abjective patrons may be seen as a screen on which the subject projects his ugly desire and thereby disavows his inner demon haunting his mind and body. Therefore, prostitutes and punters can only appear in Li Yongping's work as stereotypes, as phantoms that are simultaneously visible and invisible.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200809-x-7-45-74-a,7,2008,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

As a minor literature in Malaysia, it continues to survive, though with limited development. But its difficult circumstances remain due to the politics of literature in the country.
Extending from my previous studies on racial and political discrimination on language in Malaysia, this paper attempts to examine the bonsai situation of the cultural production of Chinese Malaysian and focuses on two recent translinguistic media cases-Huang Mingzhi incidence, and the event of The Last Communist of Malaysia. Both cases concern the unique sides of Malaysian history after its independence. The former is the case of Chinese Malaysian students in Taiwan (since 1950 a large number of Malaysian Chinese students study abroad in Taiwan) and its relevant cultural-political background. The latter is the marginalization of the Communist in Malaysia and their expel from the history of Malaysia. This paper tries to point out that the retreat of the Communist in Malaysia and the study abroad of a large number of Chinese Malaysian students in Taiwan happened to take place in the same historical moment. Both were the consequence of the Cold War. Chinese Malaysians were forced to involve in the extended struggle of Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party in overseas and the East-Asian policy of America after the Korea War. The Peace Village of Malaysian Communist after 1989, the Chinese New Village formed under the emergency, and the small intellectual community of Chinese Malaysian in Taiwan each becomes a metaphor of the other.

"The ""Seeing"" of ""Being Seen"" and Three Subjective Positions: A Post-Colonial Interpretation of Luxun's ""Slides Show Incident""",Hui-Yu Zhang,"onlookers, the slides show incident, seeing and being seen, the beheaded","If the ”seeing” and ”been seen” power relation between the West and the East derived from the context of post-colonialism, then, how did the visual experience come into being for the ”been seen” East? This paper, starting with Luxun's narration upon his engagement with Chinese Modern Literature, attempts to reveal the complex experience of modernity resulting from visual experience with respect to the well-known ”slides show incident”, and mainly aims at uncovering Chinese split subject positions: Luxun/I, onlookers and the beheaded, which connect closely with Chinese post-colonial experience and history. The author deals with the topic in three sections as follows. Firstly, Luxun's identity as pioneer of enlightenment has an internal relationship with the classroom/theatre where the ”slides show incident” happened. Secondly, the onlookers, in Luxun's view, are not just typical examples of apathetic Chinese people, and they also signify the ”seeing” position. They act as viewers of dramas, as Luxun said, who place the enlighteners such as the madmen and the lonely to a ”being seen” position, and transform the external/Japanese gazing into an internal ”seeing”. Meanwhile, Luxun himself has changed from a viewer/enlightener into a ”being seen” object such as a patient or a madman. Thirdly, those Chinese/Manchurian/Northeastern Chinese who suffered from the Japanese-Russian War are dually exiled by Luxun and his Japanese classmates, the Japanese sabers being exiled as well. As for Luxun's ambition of Remolding Chinese National Character, this undoubtedly means the overshadow of the colonized and beheaded, while for those cheerful Japanese students, it signifies the internal contradiction of Asian imagination. Luxun and those beheaded will never be included in the so-called Asia or share its victory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200809-x-7-105-148-a,7,2008,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

I also attempt to re-assess the feasibility of applying Western critical theories to local texts, as exemplified in my borrowing and criticizing some of Susan Sontag's writings on humanist photography.

Assigning Audiovisual Archives as the Topic of Cinematic Image,Song-Yong Sing,"figuration, thinking, plasticity, cinema, history, audiovisual archives, historical events, memory","In the past decade, the field of audiovisual creation, both in the Western and Eastern world, has been strongly influenced by an artistic trend of taking ”archives” as the materials of production. Creators search for and delve into the ”visual and audio archives” which are sealed and forgotten or exist contemporarily, having them been shifted, cataloged, indexed, reused and remade. ”Audiovisual archives” then gradually become the compound of embodiment (vocalization) of traces and echoes, taking up and reconstructing the highly heterogeneous materials which come from different realms. Especially it is a creative activity of recollecting, recalling and thinking attempted by using the way of montage. This study will use three relative productions: French director Jean-Luc Godard’s Histoire (s) du cinema (1988-1998), Portuguese female artist Susana De Sousa Dias' Natureza Morta (2005) and Taiwanese artist Chen Chieh-Jen's Lingchi: Echoes of a Historical Photograph (2002) to examine the shaping procedure of memory and thinking, the problem of audiovisual archives' ”subjectivity” and ”initiation in principle” and the critical journey toward the history start with assigning archives as a ”hovering” embodied/vocalized by the ”phantoms”.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200803-x-6-43-80-a,6,2008,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

"The Ripper Fascination: Morality, Discipline and Medical Imagination",Chung-Jen Chen,"From Hell, discipline, anatomical theater, medical history, East End London, Jack the Ripper, morality","This paper attempts to answer the following questions: Why are Jack the Ripper and his serial killing in East End London holding so much fascination? why does the body of East End prostitutes become the target for public execution and moral disciplining? Why does the Ripper have to be a doctor? And, why does the Ripper, as a doctor, closely associate with the maintenance of the empire and the sustenance of the institutional rationality in modernity?
By discussing From Hell, a film based on the royal conspiracy theory, this paper argues that fascination with the Ripper derives not so much from the facts of the murders, but the combination of elements of morality, discipline and medical imagination. This paper argues that representations of the Ripper as a doctor-killer are most vital for turning the Ripper into an executioner of public punishment and moral disciplining. With a comparative study of the medical history of human anatomy, the power relation embodied in the anatomical theater and the intertexuality between medical science and paintings of anatomy scene, this paper explores the function of medicine to enforce moral disciplining and to establish a knowledge system. On the mutilated bodies of prostitutes, discipline is activated, morality rehabilitated, and knowledge system established.
This paper also argues that the Ripper fascination is a result of anachronistic manipulation of medical knowledge as the ultimate form of institutional rationality. The Ripper, once presented as a doctor, is an embodiment of highly exclusively and elite medical knowledge. As a result, the Ripper is presented now as a defender for discipline and modernity. Such a representation of the Ripper indicates an inlaid paradox of the dialectics of enlightenment: hands of the doctors that used to save lives are now executing moral punishment by taking lives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200803-x-6-107-152-a,6,2008,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Moreover, quite a few of them have been hospitalized with terminal illness in need of both welfare benefits and on-site caretaking that are institutionally denied the economically disadvantaged of Taiwan.
Based on materials of ethnographic research of fifteen years, this paper addresses the following questions: How does an elderly queer in the deathbed conceive and manage matters of medical welfare, caretaking and the imminent death ceremony? In a ”modernized” Chinese society still characterized by conventional patrilineal ideology, who would be considered by a dying lesbian (namely, an unmarried daughter) to be the legitimate representative of her life-and-death arrangements? Will her queer friends join with the biological family members to carry out the job? If so, is there division of such a form of labor between ”the queer world” and ”the straight one”? In addition, how would such an investigation shed a light on analyzing the possible linkages between life politics, ethics of caretaking, and the socio-cultural significance of ”queer family”? More importantly, would this analysis aid in our understanding of the relationship between the everyday-life practices of the queer family and the possibility of constructing alternative ethical practices of caring?",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200803-x-6-153-194-a,6,2008,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Urban Experience, Urbanism and Liberation: A Study of the Peasant Worker Families in the Pearl River Delta",Iam Chong Ip,"class, urbanism, Pearl River Delta, rural migrant worker, mainland China","Since the early 1980s, contemporary China has been experiencing a dramatic change. Most researchers of China studies are concerned with its implications for social association and politics. Among them, some even feel passionate and have fantasy about the ever-expanding private sector and then predict new political changes. Others feel pessimistic about the market economy and see most emerging social groups as a kind of political ”escapism”.
This article, with focus on several rural migrant workers in the Pearl River Delta, explores the lived experience of these working people's home territories. While most live in factory dormitories segregated by sexes, some workers, particularly those married, live in rental houses and build up their temporary homes outside factories. Various social networks and activities are derived from these spaces.
This article attempts to go beyond the view of family and home as a natural unit. It borrows the recent theories about domestic domain and sees ”home” as a set of lived relation, imaginary space and territories. It is not simply a physical unit rooted in a locality or a container of family; instead, it is a locality situated in a variety of tensions including settlement and displacement, local practices and global forces, which could be seen as a part of the process of making power relations in capitalism. The most noteworthy is how the disadvantaged group tries to evade power relations in everyday life. For peasant workers, factory life is less an emancipation than a price they pay for enjoying modern life and gaining economic reward. Yet many workers could not enjoy lives of stability in their new families. The relation of production in factory does not bring working class family to them. They attempt to get rid of their identity of worker and escape from politico-economic constraints to create their own spaces in which they have conjugal intimacy, build up co-villager network, maintain familial life and pursue social mobility. In other words, they define urbanism in their own ways.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200803-x-6-195-241-a,6,2008,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

The novels of Liu Daren and Zhang Xiguo, China Times' special issue on the 1970s, Thought Magazine’s special issue on the ”Taiwanese 1970s,” as well as the last issue of The 1990s (Jiushiniandai) represent different attempts at narrating the 1970s and thus diverse ways of constructing historical consciousness. Linking together these narratives about the 1970s in North America, Taiwan and Hong Kong, I take generation and period to be two dissimilar but intersecting concepts for understanding the significance of the 1970s. By raising such ideas as the ”Chinese 1970s” and the ”transpacific generation of resistance,” this article discusses the complex historical and emotional entanglements and points out the limitation of national historiography as texts of selective memories. Through a critical analysis of these interconnected narratives about the 1970s, it seeks to carve an ”access” into the 1970s, not to restore the so-called historical truth, but to explore and capture the complexities of the 1970s as a critical historical moment. Its fruitful possibilities suggest the importance of seizing the 1970s as a critical project for the present.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200710-x-5-7-48-a,5,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Modernity as Borderland Sphere: Movements of People and Goods between Yaeyama Islands of Okinawa and Colonial Taiwan,Huei-Chu Chu,"interethnic contact, Yaeyama Islands, colonial Taiwan, cultural transplantation, modernity","Dealing with the movement of people and goods between Yaeyama Islands of Okinawa and colonial Taiwan from 1920s to 1944, this paper examines the process in which the episteme of ”modernity” had been formed through the interaction between everyday practice of movement, imperial discourses, and subject consciousness. In face of discrimination against border island and colony, People from Yaeyama and Taiwan both created their own communities in the host societies, showing that national and ethnic compartments still existed in the empire. Modernization enterprise and Japanese culture had been diverted from Yaeyama to the new colony Taiwan, but they came close to Yaeyama again with the return of Yaeyama people who worked in Taiwan and assimilated modern culture and Japanese culture. Yaeyama people were also unsettled by the gap between the imperial discourse of ”savage” Taiwanese aborigine and Han Chinese civilization they actually witnessed when they arrived Taiwan. Meanwhile, Taiwanese immigrants transplanted to Yaeyama their culture, which has been transplanted by their ancestor from southern China to Taiwan centuries ago. In the discriminating opinions towards Taiwanese immigrants, Yaeyama people had overlapped these two histories of immigration to produce the stereotype of ”premodern” Taiwanese people. I discuss how change of geopolitical position, inter-racial contact, and cultural transplantation produced in these movement has helped to constructed the episteme of ”modernity”under the empire.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200710-x-5-49-86-a,5,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Clinamen: Contemporary Cataracts of an Ancient Chance,Yuan-Horng Chu,"clinamen, event, chance, Lucretius, indeterminacy","Abstract ”Clinamen”, still a strange word for many, has gradually appeared in diverse fields such as literature and art, criticism, science, and philosophy. Yet readers in various fields usually have only partial and local understanding of its connotation. The word has rarely been translated into Chinese; and the few translations failed to provide reasonable explanation for why it was so translated. All these indicates an inadequate understanding of the unusual thought backgrounds in which this word is embedded and fluxed, an obscure history of idea that reaches back more than two thousand years. This paper examines the history of the idea ”clinamen”, especially since its rediscovery by Henri Bergson at the early twentieth century. It traces the reception and re-conception of the idea across contemporary meteors, such as literature and art in Alfred Jarry and OULIPO, philosophy of science in Michel Serres and Ilya Prigogine, and the philosophical thinking of Gilles Deleuze and Jacques Derrida. In conclusion the paper provides some critical reflections on the selfimagination of social research and cultural studies",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200710-x-5-87-118-a,5,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
To Perform or Not to Perform: Photographic Practices of Incarcerated Youths,Ching Yau,"non- performativity, deviance, photography, juvenile delinquent delinquency, scandalous equivocation, subject","Combining strategies of art education, visual analysis and queer studies, this study maps a process of my conducting media-making workshops in a female juvenile correctional facility in Japan and in a male juvenile reform institute in Hong Kong during 2002-2005, as a means of intervention into the normative cultural imaginary of ”deviant/problem/delinquent youths” and an attempt to subvert the historical appropriation of the photographic apparatus in producing and policing ”criminals”. This study first discusses how the global construction of ”deviance”/ juvenile delinquency has been shaped by sociological and psychological frameworks of the U.S., and how such frameworks might not be applicable to the socio-cultural-geopolitical contexts I work with.
I then highlight the need for youths' self-representation in relation to the dominant discourses of youth in Japan and Hong Kong, and how these discourses have been directed in legitimizing more social control on young people. Then the article explores the multiple inter-textual possibilities offered through reexamining Judith Butler's influential concept of ”gender performativity”, Mary Douglas' analysis of tribal rituals and taboos alongside the photographs taken by the jailed youths of themselves and of each other. Reading between the lines of discursive and media articulations, and between (cultural) theory and (media) practice, this juxtaposition illuminates the central normative position of ”nonperformativity” in the cultural contexts where these photos were produced. Through these explorations, this article aims to re-assert the complex implications of discursive possibilities named by Akiko Shimizu as ”scandalous equivocation” for marginalized subjects caught between the compulsions to perform and not perform simultaneously.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200710-x-5-119-166-a,5,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

With a particular emphasis on the ”imaginary of flexible identities” and its problems, I will analyze several representative cultural texts including Wang Wen-hua's bestsellers in Shanghai, The Protein Girl, its sequel The Protein Girl II, and Chen-pin's bestsellers in Taipei, a series of non-fiction works on how to survive and succeed in Shanghai. Situating these texts in the context of the Taipei-Shanghai linkage, I will critique the imagination of the flexible identities, enabled by the material conditions of global urban networks, and further lay bare not just the intricate connections between the new geopolitical regionalism and cultural narrative of Chinese transmigrants but the intense contradictions between flexible accumulation of capital and the production of ”flexible citizenship” in Aihwa Ong's terms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200703-x-4-9-40-a,4,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Norms for Gender/Sexuality and Hate Crime: The Policy Regulation of Sex Work,Ya-Fei Hsu,"sex work, discipline, victimization, sexual transaction, sexual difference, policy regulation, norm, hate crime","From 1980s on, ”child-prostitute” has been an important symbol of ”victim”. Through naming sexual transactions as crime of violence, the groups of social movements gave an impetus to legislate a set of regulations to protect the public. In this process, the boundaries of sexual differences were constantly reinforced and reconstituted. The imagination of ”victim” extended the arrangements of protection/prevention, and the concept of perpetration formed the antithetical relation of public interest and danger.
This thesis begins with the idea of ”hate crime”. It focuses on Child and Youth Sexual Transaction Prevention Act in Taiwan, which has developed specific norms for gender/sexuality with the design of these groups. From putting the accent of ”victimized” child-prostitute to the sexual difference between adults and children /teenagers, an orientation of anti-hate crime in rescuing childprostitutes towards the resistance of social exploitation and oppression were gradually replaced by policies of protection/prevention. Sexual inequality and difference turned to meet the needs of these groups, thought as their necessary political strategy. How the boundary of differences was produced in policy process? What is its becoming? From gender to age, how the sexual difference practiced power? How were the norms formed and reconstituted to be Foucauldian's ”technology of governmentality”, continuing in policies and law?",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200703-x-4-41-81-a,4,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
To Memorize a Future: The Hegelian Alphabetic Prejudice and the Artificial Evolution of Chinese Script in the Early Twentieth Century,Chun-Mei Chuang,"linguistic incommensurability, grammatical equivalence, logo-phonocentrism, alphabetic prejudice, postcolonial situation","For many Chinese intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a new and Europeanized written language was considered a vehicle of Chinese national self-transformation-not only to negotiate a possible past but also to memorize a ”modern” future. In this paper, I will examine the discursive formation of Chinese Language Reform which aimed to ”Europeanize”, ”modernize”, ”scientificize”, and more recently, ”globalize” the Chinese written language, and thereby to connect Chinese (and/or Taiwanese) culture to the ”world” (Yu-Shi-jie Jie Gui). I will argue that artificiality and technicity of writing is revealed in a postcolonial problematic. In other words, there is an implicit reflection of cultural alterity in any effort of literary reform. Intertwined with the discursive analysis, I shall also briefly discuss the related issues of phonocentrism and what I will call ”alphabetic fallacy” in Western philosophy and modern linguistics. In sum, I will suggest that the effort of ”worlding” a new ”China” by carrying out a new linguist vehicle can be understood as a presentation of human history as a peculiar form of artificial evolution through ”writing” in the broad sense. This sense of ”artificial” evolution often emerges in a moment of cultural crisis and is based on certain belief on the ”natural” evolution of western culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200703-x-4-83-134-a,4,2007,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

The theme that brings them together centers around the concern of negation, or ”negativism,” within the context of staking out a beginning and an origin. It is this originating sense that Freud's Project, the seminal pre-analytic work wherein Freud charts out the parallel physiological and psychic worlds, perhaps can serve as the common background for the efforts of the three thinkers.

Reading Psychosis,Chih-Chung Shen,"metaphor of reading, real, Freud, psychical reality, psychoanalysis, phantasy, unconscious, word presentation/object presentation, psychosis, literature","From the very beginning of his career, Freud wants to include the psychoses, very badly defined in the nosography of that time, in his new strongly systematized science. The trace of such an ardent desire of theorization remains perceptible even at the end of Freud's work. However, the psychoses will not allow themselves to be seized by psychoanalysis, which claims the right to be a science. If psychoanalysis is the science par excellence for enquiring into the beyond of consciousness, i.e. the unconscious, then the psychoses, indomitable by any knowledge, don't they constitute the beyond of the beyond of our consciousness? A kind of unconscious of the unconscious? Psychoses are to psychoanalysis, precisely as hysteria is to the psychiatry of 19th century. Studies on hysteria show the specificity of the psychoanalysis compared to psychiatry, but it is only the study of psychoses that enables us to enquire into the very limits of psychoanalysis and on its eternal desire to transgress the limits. It is also by way of psychoses that J. Lacan enters from traditional psychiatry into psychoanalysis. Thus, it appears unavoidable to us that the study of the fundamental epistemology of psychoanalysis must be accompanied by a new consideration of the relation between psychoses and psychoanalysis.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200609-x-3-6-46-a,3,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Woman in the Traumatic Real or Woman Suffering from Real Trauma: Exploring the Sexual Political Efficacy in Lacan's Graph of Sexuation and His Theory of Feminine Jouissance,Tsung-Huei Huang,"real, Jacques Lacan, sexuation, sublimation, feminine jouissance","The Lacanian assumption ”la femme n'existe pas”, which points to the impossibility of defining women, sounds dubious for some feminists as it runs the risk of further excluding women from the symbolic. On the other hand, the proponents of Lacanian psychoanalysis believe that women may start from their ”impossible” position to appropriate the feminine jouissance and further, to challenge the rigid symbolic order. Aiming to examine whether feminists should be faulted for misreading Freud's and Lacan's theories or their criticism is instrumental in locating the lacunae in psychoanalysis, this paper will take the graph of sexuation Lacan depicts in Seminar XX as a point of departure to explicate how both sexes' relation to the Other make them develop different forms of joussiance and why feminine joussiance may serve as a supplement to the symbolic structure. In short, what this paper seeks to elucidate is that, when Lacan assumes woman as closer than man to an identification with the traumatic real, he is not so much celebrating her real trauma as paving the way for us to perceive what woman suffers in the symbolic order. In this light, Lacan's theory of the feminine jousissance is consonant with rather than antithetical to feminism, as they both endeavor to deal with the problem concerning ”il n'y a pas de rapport sexuel”.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200609-x-3-47-84-a,3,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Death Drive, or the Force of Unbinding: Ethics and the Political in Julia Kristeva's Cultural Theories",Joyce C.H. Liu,"the political, psychoanalysis, ethics, the real, truth, death drive, nation","This paper deals with the concept of force in Julia Kristeva's writings that are related to her concepts of ethics and the political. This concept of force is fundamental to Kristeva's theories of the semiotic and the symbolic. It is also the ground of being. Force itself is dialectical. It moves away from itself while at the same time returns to itself. The fixation of force is the cause for violence. Eros is what binds the subject with its object, and death drive is what unbinds it. Kristeva elaborated this concept of death drive, or the force of unbinding, to discuss the culture of revolt, a culture that allows questionings and creation. Kristeva's concept of revolt is essential to her theories related to ethics and the political. This paper is divided into three movements: the first movement lays out the context of retreating the political in Europe in the later half of the twentieth century, and the place Kristeva is situated; the second movement explains how Sigmund Frued's theory about language was employed by Kristeva in her discussion of the real and the ”true real” (le Vréel), how we can detect the split or foreclosure in culture, and we can understand the force of unbinding as the force of questioning, symbolization, and creation; the third movement returns to the question of the political and the ways Kristeva re-interpret the nation as a symbolic body, a polis, open and renewable. The paper concludes with some reflections on Kristeva's ethics and on the current social conditions in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200609-x-3-85-127-a,3,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Localization of Japanese Video Games in Hong Kong: A Case Study of Street Fighter and The King of Fighters,Wai-Ming Ng,"hybird culture, game studies, localization, cultural globalization, media-mix","Hong Kong is one of the consumption centers of Japanese electronic games in Asia. As John Fiske points out that readers can become ”active readers” by adding new meanings to cultural products, Hong Kong game players, businessmen and artists have been turning Japanese games into Hong Kong-style Japanese games and other forms of hybrid culture in terms of the rule of playing, the making of crossover cultural products as well as specific languages translated, used or created. Being one of the first articles on the subject of Japanese games in Asia, it examines the reception and domestication of Japanese games in Hong Kong through a case study of Street Fighter (SF) and The King of Fighters (KOF), the two of the most popular arcade games as well as combat games in the world. Both games have had a strong impact on Hong Kong popular culture and entertainment industry. Hong Kong artists and players have been selectively and creatively incorporating elements of Hong Kong commercial movies, martial arts novels and comics, as well as lower-class slang and behavior into these two Japanese games. Examining the history of SF and KOF in Hong Kong, the making of new rules and jargons by Hong Kong players, and the adaptation of these two games into Hong Kong comics from historical and cultural perspectives, this study aims to deepen understanding of the dynamic force of localization and transnational cultural flows in forging Asian popular culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200609-x-3-129-155-a,3,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"The Devil is in the Details: Footnote, Contemporary Historiography, and (Nothing to do with) Postmodernism",Chia-Fu Sung,"paginality, orthodox historiography, footnote, a crafty reader","This paper is a collection of research notes induced by the recent publication of Huang Chin-shing's Postmodernism and Historiography: A Critical Study. Although it is meant to comment upon Huang's book, the paper does not intend to challenge Huang's anti-postmodern position directly, nor does it devote to the correction of Huang's misunderstanding of this or that concept in the kernel of postmodernism. It goes without saying that this is not a typical book review, either. Based on the fact that more than one third of the book is filled up with footnotes and bibliography and therefore almost every page is divided into upper and lower columns, what I would like to do is to take Huang's practice of footnoting under serious scrutiny. In doing so, the paper is divided into three parts. The first section analyzes the mechanism of knowledge production and resource distribution in the local academic community, which supports as well as informs the consistently dyadic page layout, i.e. what I would tentatively call the page body or paginality, of Huang's book. Secondly, the paper examines, almost case by case, the career and interaction of those scholars that have been labeled and grouped under the vague umbrella of ”traditional” and/or ”orthodox” historians in Huang's book. Thirdly, resorting to the 19th-century old-fashioned notion that the footnote is supposed to prove the text, the paper takes a close look at a few selected examples from Huang's footnotes to see if they are fulfilling their promise or not. Lastly, in place of conclusion, the paper proposes the ideas of being ”cognitively responsible” and ”a crafty reader” to be the common ideal for colleagues and friends in the academia, who have to deal with reading and writing texts on a daily base.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200609-x-3-157-197-a,3,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

Badiou shows that Paul delineates a new figure of the subject as the bearer of a universal truth and that the Pauline figure of the subject still harbors a genuinely revolutionary potential today.

Sweet Home… Seen through Changing Images (1970-1990): Snapshot Style and Family Theme in Photographic Discourses,Chi-Lin Hsu,"formalist autonomy, reality, ineffable, snapshot, family picture, photography art, imitation, intertextuality, modernism","Since the end of the 19th century, thanks for the material progress and practical simplification, the camera for snapshots has become a favorite instrument to record family life in its most spontaneous aspects. In the 1970's, the snapshots were particularly appreciated by critiques, for the main reason that the composition contingence determined by light and shadow traces responds perfectly to a certain idea of artistic photography autonomy. Such images can be characterized by ”snapshot style”, which very soon attracted critical conceptualization. But to this photographic esthetics with formalist priority was attached at the same time an ideology about new order of modern family. That is because persons in the image seem like casual in a more natural and free inter-relationship. Such compositional tendency might reflect the structural freedom rendered possible only after the corruption of paternal centered system of family organization. Nevertheless, all efforts made to establish such kind of parallel relationship between certain ideology and one imagery style can be rather compromising, and even take risk of falling into a utopian illusion. In fact, with all causes considered, all snapshots cannot catch, or create, happy family image. Between 1970 and 1990, some artists chose their own family life as a favorite subject. We can see that their practice often hesitated between two poles: one is to render semantic clearness of images once separated from their original context; the other is to explore, and somehow exaggerate, extraordinary photographic vision. But it is notable that this tension may turn out to be a good challenge and gage for photographers. So in our text, we will not only point out the contradiction between stylistic/ideological discourses and snapshots/images themselves, but also try to associate other discourses about family life seen through snapshots. Finally, we will also pay attention to dynamic interaction between style, sign and intertextual interpretations in modern photography, interaction which is indeed our first concern.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200603-x-2-9-40-a,2,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies

He was in search for the genius of the place which means the intersection of the psychic space and social reality. This paper will situate Burgin’s work in the context of the documentary photography in decline and discuss its dialectic relationship with street photography. His work internalizes the style, indexicality, and presentness of street photography and yet critically reflects on the ethical problem and ideology embedded in the representation. Burgin juxtaposes quotations from such heterogeneous texts as advertisement, critical theory, and fiction, and thus subverts the primacy and hegemony of the visual and expands the off-frame space of narratives and associations. Considering the layered meanings of the flâneur-Baudelaire's ”kaleidoscope equipped with a consciousness”, Benjamin's collector/detective/cultural producer, and Bauman's ”traveling player”, this paper will focus on Burgin's reflexion on modernity, critique of male gaze, market capitalism, postmodern space, and use of daydreams and fantasy.

The Cinema Practice in Japanese Occupied Era,Cheng-Liang Lee,"Japan occupied era, cinema, colony, popular culture, modernity","There was a close relationship between the development of cinema and western modernity. As the expanding of cinema, it was the time western imperialism expanded. On the one hand, the western colonialists built the images for their empires through the cinema, and on the other hands, to build the images of the colonies through cinema from the view of civilized/uncivilized.
Japanese imperialism commenced its colonization on Taiwan from 1895. The Japanese colonialist used the cinema to propagate the modernization life and patriotism. In the 1920s, the aim of the anti-colonialism group, Taiwanese Culture Association, was to pursue Taiwan's own modernity. They were conscious about the importance of the mass. But their problem was through which media channel they could enlighten the mass effectively? Literary reform and speech are two important attempts to solve this problem. Compared with them, however, the exhibition of cinema was a more effective way to enlighten the mass because of its combination cinema and speech. After Taiwanese Culture Association changed their aims, left-wing culture groups arose the term of 'poplar culture,' but for drama, their attitude on building the base with large masses through purchasing the value of art itself. On the other hand, the right-wing political party, their attitude to Taiwanese opera was more criticized.
Cinema was both a political practice and a leisure style.

Hesitating to Approach the Homeland: Three Facets of Native Consciousness in the Development of the Modern Taiwan Visual Art,Hsin-Tien Liao,"visual art, local color, vernacular movement, Taiwan consciousness, native native soil consciousness","The concept of the native (native soil) consciousness has always played a central role in Taiwanese modern art history. Certain types of art creation and discourse certainly existed in the periods of the Japanese Occupation (1895-1945) and after the Second World War (1945-). Such artistic developments illustrate quite literally the ”MADE IN TAIWAN” phenomenon-a problematic term with historical complexities. Furthermore, the meaning of the native is not merely the description of local customs or local subjects, but also includes a construction of subjectivity. Starting from native consciousness, Taiwan's past, present, and future are organically connected together and gradually form a thought process for subjectivity. As a governed Chinese culture, outer cultures and native culture weave an integral, but still changing Taiwanese culture and identity. This is similar to the current concepts of ”imagined community” and the ”invention of tradition.” The native therefore is not a fixed, closed, or even oldfashioned concept, but a fluctuating, updated cultural matrix. The concept of native consciousness continuously plays a positive role in the process of construction of identity and formation of subject, which is deeply embedded in the cultural framework of Taiwanese culture. Such a changing characteristic is also true to Taiwanese history. 'Unsettling' not only depicts Taiwan's historical sadness, but also is a reflection and construction of the identity and subjectivity.
With regard to the native consciousness, Taiwanese art contains ”local color” in the colonial period, a debate of the vernacular movement after the Second World War, and the emergence of Taiwan consciousness after the lifting of martial law in 1987. The three stages reflect crucial aspects of Taiwanese modern art in terms of aesthetic significance and conception of creation. The concept of the native consciousness reflects a dialogue with the outer cultures (such as western culture or imperialism) and its reflection upon it. This is also an epitome of some Asian countries, which try to survive and look for self-identity under a harsh environment. In conclusion, modern art in Taiwan, echoing with the development of the modern Asian art and the artistic thinking of globalization, has brought forth key issues in relation to its native consciousness.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200603-x-2-167-209-a,2,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"Literature in Chinese without Nation: The Pre-history of Mahua Literature in Taiwan, or, Non-Taiwanese Literature in the Literary History of Taiwan",Kim-Chew Ng,"literary history of Chinese Malaysian literature, literature without nation, literary history of Taiwan, national literature, non-Taiwanese literature, Mahua literature in Taiwan, literature of border land","Literary and historiographical discourse in Taiwan has been reconstructed as the national literature and national history since the DPP became the ruling party. This paper shows no interest in taking part in the heated Taiwan independencereunification debate; instead, the author emphasizes a comparative study based on the unique experience of a Mahua literature observer/participant and his alien and ambivalent position of insider/outsider of both Taiwan and Malaysia.
The point of departure of such an argument is ”Mahua literature in Taiwan,” which crosses the borders of both Taiwanese and Malaysian literatures in Chinese. Though a minor literary institution with only few writers and scholars involved, Mahua literature in Taiwan has its own history and contribution to local literary scene. However, in some fundamentalist Taiwanese literary histories this minor literature is excluded because it does not manifest the so-called ”Taiwan consciousness.” On the other hand, from the perspective of the border literature discourse of the pro-unificationists, it could be regarded as a border literature of the border literature. But Mahua literature in Taiwan, which was against the co-option of Overseas Chinese Literature or World Chinese Literature, should also veto such kind of co-option.
Based on a perspective of comparative Chinese literatures, the paper describes the ”borrowed” position of Mahua literature in Taiwan and its structure within the local literary system by presenting a series of tables-which schematize Taiwanese nationalist literature, literary histories and historical structures of Taiwan and Malaysia, Chinese topographical history, and the ideological orientation of Mahua literature in Taiwan. Furthermore, it investigates the concept of a Chinese (Taiwanese) literature without nationality-i. e., the possibility of the existence of a third literature beyond the two extremes of literary nationalism. A creative tension might emerge between such a literature without nation and the nation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200603-x-2-211-252-a,2,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Literary History and the Boundary of the Nation: Focusing on Aileen-Chang and Constructing Taiwanese New Literary History,Im WooKyung,"Taiwanese New Literary History, Taiwanese Nationalism, Aileen Chang, ethnical identity","Since 1990s, with gradual consciousness of independence, writing Taiwanese New Literary History, as an important apparatus in imaging national community, has been one of the most heated controversies. However, it faces some embarrassing problems such as the contradiction between political independence from and cultural identification with main land China, and between national identity and that of minority. The essay scrutinizes the ideological, cultural dilemma centering on how Taiwanese evaluate Aileen-Chang in Taiwanese New Literary History. Part Two examines how Taiwanese accepted her, cross-checking in the specific context of her diaspora, postcolonialism, and cold war. In Part Three, The essay compares the opposite viewpoints of Chen Fangming and Qiu Guifen, while the former claims to accept Aileen-Chang, the latter claims not. These two representative critics advocate Taiwanese independence and rewriting Taiwanese New Literary History. In sum, the essay demonstrates that the boundary of nation is in fact arbitrary. It also reminds the hazard of that if writing Taiwanese New Literary History is subject to the ”Taiwanese Nationalism,” another grand narrative, its political resistive power and concern for minority might be lost.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200603-x-2-253-279-a,2,2006,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Politics of Death in Modernity,Yin-Bin Ning,"Corpse, Modernity, Thanatology, Body, Death, Routine","The prevalent approach in Taiwan's thanatological discourse treats death as simply common fate of humanity, while overlooks the constructive dimension of modern death. This reductive and essentialized approach to the issues of death, in my view, provides only one-sided view on the moral and political controversies surrounding death and funeral rituals. Following theories of Giddens, Elias, Ariès, Seale and others, this essay explores the relation between death and modernity, and the politics of modern death. In the end, this essay shows the politics of dead body (corpse) is an important element of the politics of modern death and modern body.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200509-x-1-1-45-a,1,2005,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
The Problematisation of Taste in the Classic Age (1650-1800),Der-Liang Chiou,"subjectivation of taste, appearance and existence, substitutive moral, honnêtes gens, aesthetic of existence","The problematisation of taste means how the taste becomes a care in the society? And what kind of care it concerns? For the first time in the classic age (1650-1800), the taste became a topic of conversation in aristocratic society of France. The talkative theories about it reveal a complex problematic of ethico-politics and aesthetics. For the courtesans and honnêtes gens, it is in question of a substitution of the aesthetic subject for the moral subject. These social actors who are taste-makers change into a object of art, seen and be seen, judged and be judged. In the social life of aristocratic society where take place the scenes of the cultural competitions and ferocious struggle, the possession of taste involves both a will of existence and a symbolic violence.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200509-x-1-47-72-a,1,2005,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Self-Fashioning of a Global City: The Politics of Shanghai Nostalgia,Tsung-Yi Michelle Huang,"global city, Wang Anyi, Shanghai, production of urban space, the politics of nostalgia","This article aims to explain how the nostalgic narratives of Old Shanghai are informed by the projected self-image of the global city. In the contemporary development of the global city in East Asia, two common rules underpin the rhetoric of place-making. First, the urban planning discourse projects an ideal other as a role-model, such as London or New York, for the blueprint of redevelopment. Second, this language tends to look back to uncover a historical era of the city and in so doing rationalizes the global city formation as a continuation of the old glories. In the process of Shanghai's urban restructuring since the late 1980s the promotion language finds itself exemplary of the two characteristics mentioned above. The urban discourse of Shanghai of the late twentieth century draws attention to Old Shanghai in the 1930s-the city's past of extraterritoriality serves to justify Shanghai's global city campaign. Meanwhile, the cosmopolitan culture and cityscape of Old Shanghai in this semi-colonial past are invoked as a predecessor of existing world-famous global cities. This Shanghai nostalgia, wish-fulfillment rhetoric indeed, takes a complicated shape in some of the works of Shanghai novelist Wang Anyi. Juxtaposing the urban discourse of Shanghai nostalgia and Wang Anyi's detailed portrayal of the good old days of Shanghai lilongs in her novel, The Song of Unending Sorrow, I tease out the tension between Shanghai nostalgia in Wang's literary representations of the transformation of Shanghai and the two rules of selffashioning a global city so as to further critique the problems inherent in the place-making ideology of contemporary global cities.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200509-x-1-73-96-a,1,2005,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
"""Indigenization"" (bentuhua) of Taiwanese Literature: Historical Narrative, Strategic Essentialism and State Power",A-Chin Hsiau,"nationalism, Taiwanese literature, narrative identity, strategic essentialism, indigenization","”Indigenization”, or bentuhua, a general idea that the uniqueness of Taiwanese society/ culture/history must be appreciated and interpreted from the viewpoint of the Taiwanese per se, has been a powerful paradigm that directs and informs the discourse on Taiwanese literature and history since the 1980s in Taiwan. In this paper I aim to explain why the literary indigenization paradigm has come to cause fiercer debates and has closer connection with the identity politics of ethnicity and nationalism than the indigenization idea in other areas (except history). Some studies have made contribution to the understanding of the historical, empirical context of the creation and rise of the indigenization paradigm in literature. Instead this paper focuses on the theoretical, analytical dimension and offers three theoretical, analytical explanations for the questions: 1) because the literary indigenization paradigm engenders a kind of antagonism between different historical narratives which is difficult to be weakened; 2) because in the identity politics strategic essentialism is ready to slide from a mere strategy to a form of de facto essentialism that provokes an essentialist backlash; 3) because the literary indigenization paradigm and the conflict caused by it, after all, involves state power. In this paper the discussion of these three factors centers on the essence of the indigenization paradigm in the area of literature, that is, a narrativized view of reality as a meaningful configuration that identifies the narrator in an exclusive way.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200509-x-1-97-129-a,1,2005,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
State as a Borderline Identity: Settling the Jing Ethnicity in China,Chih-Yu Shih,"Kinh, cross-border nationality, Vietnamese, Daban Yao, Korean","Ethnic Communities on the sovereign borders often face the problem of double identities. This paper reports on the identity strategy of the Kinh people on the Sino-Vietnamese borders. Basically, the Kinh people identify with the Vietnamese identities culturally, but are able to separate them from the backward image in their identity as a Chinese citizen. The paper studies how the preservation of the cultural identity parallels with the construction of a separate state identity. State is reduced to an identity strategy in this case, suggesting the people on the border are not always passively torn between multiple sovereign controls.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200509-x-1-147-168-a,1,2005,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
Economic Discourse in Cultural Policy: From Elite Culture to Cultural Economy,Li-Jung Wang,"cultural industry, creative industries, cultural economy, cultural policy","This paper explores the development of 'creative industries' in cultural policy based on the following two perspectives: 1) changing cultural values and 2) the broadening of the definition of the term 'culture'. This paper further highlights policy trends observed in western societies and Taiwan. Such trends include: economic factors taking on increasing importance in cultural policymaking, with the potential to integrate to a significantly greater degree cultural and economic policies; the shift of the focus of cultural policy from aesthetic and social values to economic values; the increasingly blurred definition of 'culture' that is occurring concomitantly with the increasingly inclusive definition of that term. The boundaries between the arts and entertainment, elite and mass culture, and public and commercial culture are disappearing. Under this situation, cultural policy is both viewed as 'very important', while being 'ignored' at the same time. The result is that such policies are currently facing challenges and crises that are quite different than previously faced.
Therefore, this paper hopes to rethink the values and concept of culture from cultural policy. The main argument is that 'creative industry' shows an important turn from 'state discourse', 'citizenship course' to 'economic discourse'. In addition, the concept of culture is moving from 'elite culture' to 'cultural economy'. The values of culture have been changed in contemporary society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=18160514-200509-x-1-169-195-a,1,2005,Router_ A Journal of Cultural Studies
