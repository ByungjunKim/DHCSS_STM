"Food and Gender Images of the Kam in Guizhou, China",Shu-jung Lin,"food, production, personhood, marriage exchange, gender image, social reproduction","The Kam people of Guizhou, China construct their gender relationships in the contexts of food production, exchange, and consumption. After examining gendered work divisions to understand how the Kam practice everyday gender relationships, I discuss images of love and sentiment associated with peanuts, which are treated as “women’s food.” Peanuts are usually produced by women in fields that are mostly segregated from those cared for by men, and are generally tended by individual women or women’s groups. During courtship, peanuts are occasionally raised with male cooperation, thereby embodying images of play and of being “a guest” preceding marriage. During the period of marriage exchange, men (as wife-takers) regularly send portions of glutinous steamed rice to the women’s clans until their first pregnancies and eventual transfer to male households. Rice, which is grown in “men’s” fields, must be co-worked by men and women during the harvest season before wives move into their husbands’ households. The harvest ritual expresses a sense of rice as the main substance for “the constitution of the person” as well as social reproduction. In this paper I also analyze such forms of discourse as myths and songs in addition to taboos and rituals to understand the construction of Kam food symbolism and gender image. In myths and ancient songs that are still performed today, the chicken is used as a symbol to express female social reproduction images, while men and their patrilineal groups make annual offerings of pork and steamed rice to local female deities in recog",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/67-3.pdf,67,2007,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Rice, Deer and Rooster: Foods, Power and Gender Symbols Among the Kavalan of Taiwan",Pi-chen Liu,"food, gender, power, symbolic aspects, sex differences, rice","This paper uses documentation, narratives of senior informers and analyzes the still-practiced rituals, related mythology and the prohibition of daily foods in Kavalan village in Sinshe (Hualian County, Taiwan) in attempt to reconstruct the subtle and complex associations of representation between food-centered activities, meaning and gender relations among the Kavalan. Foods of the Kavalan, for example, rice and cocks, which were mainly women’s responsibilities, and wild deer, which were hunted by men were produced, consumed, shared or exchanged, and also had significance in terms of describing phenomena and carrying meanings. These signs were the medium of communication among people, expressing their thoughts and emotions, and also the representation of their sharing, which can be regarded as a practice of social production/ reproduction and a field of action. At the same time, these signs were used to construct distinct male and female subjects. In this paper, we will argue that each process of subjectivization was somewhat different. Distinct contexts produce different gender images and gender relationships, for example, the change from dry-rice to wet-rice, the Japanese colonial government’s involvement in wet-rice production, the hunting ban, the belief in the God of Land of the Han Chinese, the encounter with Christianity, and then the influence of capitalism and globalization today, etc. In other words, the construction of gender and the production/ consumption/exchange of food were not simply vested or unchanged categories, but continuously interacting.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/67-4.pdf,67,2007,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

Grooved Stone Sinker and Cast Net of Prehistorical Taiwan,Yu-pei Chen,"grooved stone sinker, cast net, Austronesian","The double grooved stone net sinker is one of the most frequently-seen archaeological remains from Taiwan sites, mainly neolithic. The sinker was tied to the edges of a cast net. Cast net fishing is usually applied at riversides, lagoons and the seashore. Cast-net fishing is considered as a unique fishing method, and was in widespread use within the Taiwan region. However, the line-hook method was a common fishing technique in the Taiwan peripheral area. Although cast-net fishing has also been found on the Pacific archipelagoes, it is believed this method was not introduced to these islands until much later. Besides, there were almost no double grooved stone net sinkers discovered from prehistoric sites. The research on the“Patu” and the“bark beater”, which is cited to support the close relationship between Taiwan’s prehistory and the Austronesian's peoples, compares archaeological data with the ethnographic data of today's Austronesians. Note however, that the time gap should be taken into consideration in these kind of comparison studies.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/67-6.pdf,67,2007,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Failed Families and Quiet Individualism: Domestic Abuse and Women’s Strategies of Resistance in Urban Taiwan,Marc L. Moskowitz,"domestic abuse, family, filial piety, gender, quiet individualism, Taiwan","The tensions between individual desires and the needs of the family exist in any society. Yet in Taiwan there is a greater rhetorical emphasis on self sacrifice for the needs of family than in many Western nations. In the following pages I will draw on several interviews and closely examine five in depth interviews of domestic abuse in Taiwan in order to explore just how far individual sacrifices can be demanded in the name of familial responsibility. These are by no means common cases in Taiwan but they highlight tensions between individual needs and group obligations in starker clarity than average familial relations. Confucianism is so male oriented that its effects on women are understudied. The following pages will demonstrate the tremendous moral and psychological force that Confucianism has also had on women. The extent to which the women in these accounts have suffered for their families is shocking, yet their stories also highlight the fact that even in the most extreme cases of familial abuse, individuals still maneuver to fulfill their own wants and needs to the degree that it is possible. This demonstrates what I have called Quiet Individualism, as opposed to the more overt Western Enlightenment form of Individualism, in that individuals attempt to protect their own interests while maintaining an ideological commitment to Confucian precepts that familial concerns outweigh individual interests.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/67-7.pdf,67,2007,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Using Intellectual Property Rights to Protect Indigenous Cultures:Critique on the Recent Development in Taiwan,Kai-Shyh Lin,"intellectual property rights, indigenous peoples in Taiwan, cultural rights, traditional intellectual creation","After the establishment of the Council of Indigenous Affairs, the indigenous people’s movement in Taiwan began to turn its attention to the problem of passing special legislations to advance and consolidate gains and benefits. One of the major developments in recent years was the use of intellectual property rights to protect and promote indigenous cultures. Examining the “Protection Act for the Traditional Intellectual Creations of Indigenous Peoples” passed by the legislators in 2007, this article points out that even though the Act tries to circumvent limitations of current intellectual property right law, its basic assumptions about the nature of cultural tradition are too idealized and rigid to cope with the complexity of socio-cultural dynamics in Taiwan. The political construction of ethnic classification by various colonial regimes in the past and the flexible tradition of indigenous art and crafts in the present all challenge any attempt to erect hard boundaries among different ethnic cultures. Thus, this article argues that the Protection Act is not just unnecessary but could be detrimental to the vitality and creativity of indigenous cultures in contemporary Taiwan.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/67-8.pdf,67,2007,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Reinvention of Ethnicity and Culture: A Comparative Study on the Atayal and the Truku in Taiwan,Mei-hsia Wang,"ethnicity, identity, reinvention of culture, Atayal, Truku","In this paper, I have examined the ethnic classification based on the Japanese colonial background in the first part. Secondly, I have discussed the process of the Truku Name Rectification Campaign and the standards of definition of an ethnic group proposed by the leaders of the campaign. These standards reflect the objective classification in contemporary society, therefore, the “objective” standards led to many conflicts. In order to understand the name rectification campaign, understanding the Taiwanese political and economical background is necessary. On the one hand, the government in power supported the ethnic group campaign to highlight that Taiwan is a country with multiple ethnic groups or to gain votes. On the other hand, elite aboriginals could participate in politics and increase the numbers of members in Congress. Also, they could promote a self-governing movement to change the aboriginal disadvantages in politics, economics and culture. When the name campaign succeeded, how to reconstruct “Truku culture” became an important issue. The ancestral ritual provides a field on which to congregate the “Truku” collective consciousness. Although ancestral rituals disappeared when the Presbyterian Church questioned their legitimacy, these processes created a chance for people to integrate modern beliefs into traditional culture. This cultural reinvention is continuing. Finally, I have made a comparison between the Atayal and the Truku cultures, especially focusing on their two key cultural concepts ─ gaga (gaya) and lyutux (utux). This illustrates how cultures are redefined and practiced differently, according to their local contexts. The invention of culture is ongoing in the locals’ everyday lives, rather than only taking place in the social movement, e.g., the Name Rectification movement.

Examining Possible Prehistoric Ceramic Transfers among Six New Caledonian Lapita Sites Through Petrographic Analysis,"Scarlett Chiu, Yi-lin Chen, Chun-lin Lin","Lapita Cultural Complex, petrographic analysis, New Caledonia","The diversity observed from aspects of manufacture techniques, decoration motifs, and morphology of Lapita pottery has long been employed by Pacific archaeologists to identify social group boundaries and classify different cultural periods, as they investigate the spread of the Austronesian-speaking populations into the vast Oceania. The ultimate research goal aims to discover possible raw material procurement areas and pottery-making workshops in New Caledonia through identifying tempers originated from specific geological zones and site-specific patterns of paste preparation, in both petrographic and chemical compositions, in order to discuss prehistoric ceramic transfers and the inferred social and economic meanings of Lapita pottery.

Sakizaya’s Name Rectification Campaign under the Perspective of Cultural Construction,"Shiun-wey Huang, Yih-ju Su","Sakizaya, Name Rectification Campaign, ethnie, cultural construction, ‘traditional costumes’, Palamal (the Fire God Ritual)","After the KMT succeeded the Japanese colonial government in Taiwan in 1945, officials continued to apply the then current method of categorizing Taiwanese aborigines into nine groups. Since the 1980’s, though, many aboriginal groups have launched name rectification campaigns and have called for ‘independence’ from their originally designated groups. The occurrence of various name rectification campaigns not only sheds light on the inadequacies of the old system of categorization, but also reflects the rise of the aborigines’ own awareness. The Sakizaya’s Name Rectification Campaign can be observed in this context. Dutch records from the 17th century identify the Sakizaya as a distinct group different from the Amis people. The decline of the Sakizaya was initiated by the Jia-Li-Wan event in 1878. After defeat by Ching soldiers the Sakizaya obscured their identities by mixing themselves among the Amis. When the Japanese started their ethnographic research in the early 20th century, the Sakizaya had become relatively “Amis-ized,” and were regarded as a sub-branch of the Amis for both academic and official purposes. The Sakizaya’s new ethnic group movement was initiated in 1990. On January 17, 2007 the Sakizaya gained official recognition as an independent aboriginal group. Rather than focusing on the government’s procedures of ethnic group identification, this paper intends to investigate the strategies of movement activists. It not only examines the concept of cultural construction but also explains why this concept is so important in understanding the case of Sakizaya. Furthermore it interprets two major constructions in this campaign. The first one is the so called ‘traditional costumes’, which were invented as a distinguishing ethnic symbol. The second one is Palamal (the Fire God Ritual). On the basis of using the symbol of fire, this ritual serves to recall participants’ historical memory of ancestors who died in the Jia-Li-Wan event and reinforce their Sakizaya identity at the same time.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/68-3.pdf,68,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Archaeology of House Societies,Chih-hua Chiang,"house society, Austronesian societies, social memory, prehistoric societies","The concept of House Society was first proposed by Lévi-Strauss in the 1950s. Because this concept provides a link between material culture and social organization, it offers archaeologists an avenue to discuss prehistoric social relations. This article reviews anthropological and archaeological research of the House Society concept and specifically examines cultural anthropologists' usage of this model to understand Austronesian social organization in Southeast Asia. Additionally, a review of archaeological approaches using House Society to discuss social relations is examined. Finally, I suggest that this concept can be an important and useful idea for archaeological research in Taiwan. Cultural anthropologists have identified common traits among the Austronesian societies associated with material culture which provide archaeologists evidence to investigate prehistoric social organization. Three ways of applying the House Society concept to archaeology are recognized. The first, is to emphasize the continuous presence of this type of social organization among Austronesian societies. House Society is regarded as an ancient pattern that can be traced through prehistoric Austronesian societies. Second, House Society is viewed as a heuristic device to consider the relationship between architecture, social relations and cultural categories. The third is to consider House Society as a form of social organization in social history which can then be tested worldwide. The purpose of reviewing archaeological research regarding House Societies around the world is to emphasize the potential forf using this concept to understand prehistoric Taiwanese societies. Also, this concept can help archaeologists to reinterpret archaeological data recovered from Taiwan.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/68-4.pdf,68,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Current Archaeological Studies in the Ryukyu Islands and Their Connections with Taiwan Archaeology,Goto Masahiko,"Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, archaeology, prehistoric culture, interaction","This paper begins with a review of recent studies in the archeology of the Ryukyu Islands. For this purpose, we identify two prehistoric cultures: the northern Ryukyu Islands (Amami Islands, Okinawa Islands) and the southern Ryukyu Islands (Miyako Islands, Yaeyama Islands). Next, based on archeological commonalities between the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, I will focus on multitude of regional interactions between the areas, including the short-range relations, that are in fact a characteristic feature of this region of East Asia in the period between 2000-1000 BCE. The use of the marine resources such as shells and fishing tools are also treated in a discussion of the similarities and connections between Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. These common issues are used to discuss exchange relations between Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands and to understand the points of contact between the archeology of the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/68-5.pdf,68,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Division and Re-Construction of Traditional Territory: Re-Examining Human-Land Configuration and Spatial Change of Kucapungane,Taiban Sasala,"space, landscape, tribal mapping, traditional territory, Rukai","Residential lands, farmlands and hunting grounds are important bases and arenas for the production and existence of the Rukai people. They are also significant as memory spaces for historical experience and cultural continuity. For the Rukai people, these place names and stories distributed over these lands and grounds, are not just oral history and common memories, but are also the human-land configuration that connects the past and present. However, these spaces are not always static or unchanging, in fact they become spaces and landscapes in the traditional territory in which various conflicting knowledges, powers and consciousnesses compete. This paper takes the Kuchapogan as an example to discuss the transformation and continuity of space and tries to view the impact and influence on landscape concepts and cultural identification when external force such as the state and western religion intervene in local space. Moreover, this paper will also look at how the local community connected ancestors and historical memories as well as re-constructed their spatial identification through mapping.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/69-2.pdf,69,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
“Spirits Fly Slow” (pahapahad no anito) : Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Cultural Revivalism in Lan-Yu,Jackson Hu,"traditional ecological knowledge, ancestry, landscape, cultural revival, place names, environmental experience, butterfly conservation, Yami, Lan-YuOrchid Island","This paper attempts to widen the relational discourse regime of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) research in Taiwan, and deepen the socio-cultural analysis using local narratives of species and places to illuminate the contemporary environmental practices that result from emic cultural insights of ancestry. The Yami people on the island of Lan-Yu employ various plants and animals, via an association with spiritual symbolism, to manifest their visualizations of an ancestral power. Past Yami TEK referred to ancestral ownership or group privilege through landscape remembrance in a sense of the genealogical institution regime, and expressed the intimate feelings that occurred when they encountered the diverse species and places of the island, especially those which served as remembrances of ancestral acts and/or the manifestations of spiritual beings. After the introduction of many national projects during the last century, the once fertile traditional harvest of the forest and ocean vanished for decades, resulting in cultural schism between generations, as exemplified by the frustration, melancholy, and a sense of loss pervading the Yami elders in their effort to convey a cultural heritage to the younger generation, a heritage that remains based on an environment that is no longer visible. Villagers mourn their sacred groves where vanishing species and barren rock indicate the long-term absence of intimate interactions with ancestry once found in the “golden days of old”. The revival of interests in TEK among the islanders is considered a desirable and venerable tool in their efforts to combat landscape degradation. Moreover, the re-focused TEK discourse in the tribal conservation was persistently used by Yami to “heal” landscape through the reconnection of ancestor-offspring relations. After commercial exploitation of an endemic species, the Golden Butterfly, a recovery project was initiated in the 2000s, and serves to demonstrate how the Yami TEK of a culturally trivialized species has been successfully over-emphasized in a contemporary tribal revitalization of ancestral ecological views as means to preserve an endangered species. Although governmental funding stopped since 2004 due to the tight budget, the indigenous self-sustaining landscape management employed by the Yami operates autonomously until now. It has greatly encouraged local Iranmeylek villagers that their landscape care is as good or better than those of the scientifically minded professionals representing the Taiwan’s conservation bureaucracy. Moreover, it exemplifies a spiritually empowered community development strategy that may prove to be widely applicable in the indigenous societies. Although global economic integration has significantly marginalized the locally subsistent Yami communities, recent tribal highlights of ancestry follow the ethos of TEK, articulating the global conservation paradigm with the ancestral embodiments embedded on the landscape. Contemporary TEK unveil a renewing strategy, also as an ultimate goal of cultural struggle, to experience ancestry at large which exemplifies how local Yami interact with the globalization process through their landscape practice.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/69-3.pdf,69,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"What Tradition? Whose Territory? : A Critical Review to the Indigenous Traditional Territory Survey and the Translation of Spatial Knowledge in Marqwang Case, Taiwan","Da-wei Kuan, Yi-ren Lin","indigenous community mapping, traditional territory survey, Atayal, spatial knowledge","This paper aims to discuss the translation of spatial knowledge and the social space in which the knowledge was translated. Since Native American communities successfully claimed their land rights with community map originally developed under the academic interest of geographers and anthropologists in 1970s, community mapping has been gradually applied by indigenous communities around the world and developed into diverse methodologies. In 2002, Taiwan government launched the nation-wide ITTS in response to the rising indigenous land claims, under which community mapping was designed as a main method to identify traditional territory for every indigenous community. In 2007, Taiwan government firstly announced the traditional territory of Marqwang group of indigenous Atayal people, but unexpectedly caused further conflict between Marqwang group and its neighbor Atayal communities. Aiming to explore the epistemological controversy and methodological limits of community mapping in ITTS, this paper examine how the method of “indigenous community mapping” was translated in Taiwan society and how indigenous traditional territory was socially constructed under the influence of this translation. Further more, by review the Marqwang case, this paper examine how Atayal spatial knowledge was translated into modern concept of “territory” in the implement of ITTS, and led to the conflicts between indigenous communities. In the end, this paper argues that the misappropriation of indigenous knowledge is the fundamental reason caused the conflicts.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/69-4.pdf,69,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
When Landscape Encounters the Law: The Legalization of Land and its Quandary in Solomon Islands,Pei-yi Guo,"landscape, legal anthropology, land dispute, Solomon Islands, Austronesians","Landscape has been where people and ancestors encounter each other in Austronesian societies, it is also the field in which history is shaped, memorized and represented. The penetration of the Western legal system brings in another mode of imagining human-land relations, furthermore, people’s relationships to landscape have been transformed in the process of legalization. Since the independence of Solomon Islands in 1978, the majority of land has been returned to indigenous hands, the new legal regime has adopted ‘customary land tenure’, and local elders or chiefs have been incorporated into court proceedings. However, despite various implementations to incorporate indigenous practices and their land tenure, land disputes continue to be a problem in the post-independence state, and the ideal of preserving traditional human-land relationships has not been achieved. The failure calls for explanations. In this paper, I first review the history of land tenure alteration in the Solomon Islands, including the amendment of related land laws and the development of the court system, and local responses to those policies and measures. I will then analyze case files in local land courts, in particular evidence from land surveys, narratives of various agents in court hearings, and their representational tactics. The codification of land tenure cannot preserve ‘tradition’. Instead it changes the nature of customary land tenure from flexibility to fixation, from one which combines biological and behavioral principles to a more rigid patrilineal rule of inheritance. The process of legalization—including the human/thing dichotomy embedded in the identification of ‘evidence’ in court system, and the presupposed definition of property in law—contributes to the shift of people’s relation to landscape from processual to inscriptive concepts. Revealed in the contesting modes of historical representation through landscape is the transformation of how people, ancestors and landscape are associated: no longer linked by spiritual power, it turns into a matter of inherited possession. Legalization is not the sole antidote to the problem of land, and we need to look into the dynamics of cultural concepts in the process of legalization.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/69-5.pdf,69,2008,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Emergence of a New Sexual Ideal: A Case Study of Yuki Maiko’s Pornographic VCDs in Hong Kong,"Hoi-yan Yau, Heung-wah Wong","Japanese pornographic adult videos, cultural production/ appropriation, local female sexual ideal, class structure, Yuki Maiko","This paper explores why a female Japanese adult video star, Yuki Maiko, was so popular among men in Hong Kong during the late 1990s. We argue that the image she embodies is very similar to that of an emerging sexual ideal among the Hong Kong new middle class in the early and mid 1990s. Her image of being sexual and orgasmic but ultimately passive in her sexuality is arguably the idealisation of this kind of emerging sexual symbol in Hong Kong. Through our analysis of interview data with 17 men in Hong Kong, we contend that this emerging sexual ideal is closely related to the changing class structure and cultural trend with regard to femininity. As this paper will show, the contradictory terms inherent in the identity formation of the new middle class in 1980s’ Hong Kong explains why many new middle class young men would identify with Japan in general and Japanese culture in particular as a symbol of their new identity. The resulting submersion in Japanese culture in turn allows them to find favour with the “cute and gentle” female ideal, an alternative femininity to the previous aggressive model, which has become popular in Hong Kong since the mid-1990s.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/70-1.PDF,70,2009,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Place and Environmental Movement in Houjin, Kaohsiung",Hsin-yi Lu,"social movements, environmental movement, community, place, Kaohsiung","This paper documents the origins, processes, and outcomes of Houjin’s long-lasting environmental campaign against the CPC. The field site, Houjin, is a working-class neighborhood located in the northernmost district of Kaohsiung City. Houjin community was mobilized for a three-year protest in 1987-1990, and then in 2004, against the neighboring Kaohsiung Refinery of the Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC)ЁTaiwan’s chief oil company and the main source of pollution in the area. I suggest that place provides a vantage point from which to better understand the motive and resilience of Houjin’s two decade long environmental campaign. This basic argument has two connotations: first, place-based identity as Houjin-ren (people of Houjin), constituted in the shared pollution experience, kinship and neighborly networks, and communal religious rituals, was the basis for mobilizing across factional and partisan lines within the community. Second, other than merely a counteract to the polluting Refinery, the movement was indeed a communal struggle over defining the meaning, identity, and future of the place Houjin. The environmental movement set in motion a cultural politics through which the position and identity of Houjin was being reconceptualized as activists fight for recognition of their rights to the environment. In this sense, the Houjin movement is parallel to other community-based social movements occurring in the world, in which place plays a pivotal role in the production of environmental awareness.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/70-2.PDF,70,2009,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Subways as a Space of Cultural IntimacyΚ The Mass Rapid Transit System in Taipei, Taiwan",Anru Lee,"subway, national identity, global city, cultural intimacy, Taiwan","This article sees Taipei’s newly inaugurated Mass Rapid Transit System as a space of cultural intimacy wherein Taipei City residents (re) shape their collective identity against Taiwan’s recent political history as well as within the current global economic context. Temporally, the knowledge derived from the shared sentiment of cultural intimacy helped people in Taipei to construct a present self that is civilized and enlightened, separating from their politically repressive and unruly past. Spatially, as Taiwan is increasingly integrated into the global system and highly receptive to changes in the world economy, the Taipei residents’ new self-identity also takes on new significance. The timing of the completion of the MRT coincided with Taiwan’s recent economic restructuring on the one hand and the emergence of global cities as the main site of global economic competition on the other. Behaving in an orderly way as well as keeping a positive image of the MRT, therefore, resonates with Taipei residents’ efforts and desire to keep their city economically competitive. The contrast between the refined manners of Taipei’s daily commuters and the recurring misdemeanors of out-of-town visitors on the MRT seems only to confirm the growing discrepancy between a globalizing Taipei and Taiwan’s deindustrialized hinterland that is gradually lagging behind. Yet, the anxiety seeping through some of the self-deprecating comments I heard during the course of my research clearly indicates the precarious nature of the current global economic system and the resulting challenges faced, and uncertainties felt, by the Taiwanese people including those in Taipei.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/70-3.PDF,70,2009,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Report on the Small-Scale Test Excavation of the Beitou Tram’s Yangming Park Scheduled Station,Su-chiu Kuo,"blue and white porcelain, “Second Expansion of the Taipei Water Supply Engineering Project,” Cao Mountain Water Supply System, stoneware pipe, red brick","According to the results of the excavation and survey conducted at the Beitou tram’s Yangming Park scheduled station, it has been determined that the excavation site area contains the cultural remains and relics of at least two different periods (listed below): 1.The middle to late Qing dynasty: Cultural remains from the middle to late Qing dynasty (or the period around and between 1750 and 1850) were unearthed from the lower stratum of pit 1. These remains include fragments of blue and white porcelain bowls and hard, porous vessels produced in folk kilns in middle and southern Fujian province as well as ash pits possibly used to dispose of waste materials. Blue and white porcelain wares as well as other remains from the same period were also found in the farmland and survey section in and around the excavation site. Due to these findings, it can be deduced that during the middle to late Qing dynasty there were people living and working in the excavation site area. The middle to late Qing dynasty also roughly corresponds to the period of the Han people’s cultivation of the entire Yangming Mountain region. 2.The Japanese occupation period and the “Second Expansion of the Taipei Water Supply Engineering Project” (Cao Mountain Water Supply System): According to pit test and excavation results, it has been confirmed that the material used to construct the water channeling pipeline found within the excavation site is iron. Tar coats the outside of the pipeline which is 30.3 cm (centimeters) in diameter. This pipeline is embedded approximately 80 to 110 cm (centimeters) below the current rock facing and is located in the center of the andesite rock-fold structure.

"Local Society under Military Governance: A Study of the Chinese Diaspora Networks of Quemoy, 1949-1970s",Bo-wei Chiang,"Chinese diaspora networks, battlefield Quemoy, war history, social change.","After 1949, Quemoy became a battlefront between the KMT and the CCP, as well as the frontline in the confrontation between Cold War blocs. Under military administration, the power of traditional lineages was suppressed and their connections with their fellow countrymen living abroad were severed. For forty-three long years, until 1992, Quemoy was transformed from an open hometown of the Chinese diaspora into a closed battlefield and forbidden zone. Members of the Quemoy diaspora were often closely engaged with their hometown during the war years of the 1940s, they were deeply concerned about the security of their family members and their property. In the early 1950s, they tried to keep informed about the situation in Quemoy through any medium possible, and also tried to build new channels for remittances. Because formal visits by Overseas Chinese were an important symbol of legitimacy for the KMT, Quemoy emigrants were invited by the military authorities to visit their hometown. This became the only channel by which participants in the Chinese diaspora could return to their native place. This paper uses official archives, military newspapers and oral history to analyze how military authorities formulated policies for the Chinese diaspora in battlefield Quemoy, and to study the interaction between family and clan members in the Chinese diaspora and in their ancestral homeland during the period 1949-1970s. This analysis enables a discussion of the distinctive continuities and discontinuities of local history.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/71-2.pdf,71,2009,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"The Politics of Memory in a Geopolitical Flashpoint: Kinmen ΰQuemoyα, 1949-2008",Michael Szonyi,"collective memory, politics of memory, Kinmen, Quemoy, Cold War history, militarization","In 1949, the small island of Kinmen ΰQuemoyα in the Taiwan Strait became the front line in the military standoff between Chiang Kai-shek’s Republic of China on Taiwan and Mao Zedong’s People’s Republic, a flashpoint of global geopolitical confrontation, and a powerful symbol of anti-Communist resolve for the Republic of China ΰROCα and its allies As a result, Kinmen became one of the most highly militarized societies in history, a place where daily life was inexorably connected to international geopolitics. Though the soldiers are largely gone from Kinmen today, militarization and geopoliticization have left enduring legacies. This paper explores the politics of local memory in contemporary society. It argues that the experience of militarization and demilitarization is remembered through four distinct discourses: an official discourse of commemoration, and three social discourses: of heroic agency, of victimization, and of nostalgia. Each of these discourses is deployed in a variety of contemporary political struggles, within Kinmen, between Kinmen and Taiwan, and between Kinmen and the mainland. These ways of remembering are thus as much about Kinmen’s present and future as about its past. The paper argues that local actors make use of collective memory in entrepreneurial ways, but their ability to do so is constrained by the inertia of collective memory. Furthermore, popular memory is not always subversive of official memory.

In this new era, pilgrimages in Mazu have also developed forms different from those seen in Taiwan pilgrimages. Formed in the new regional politico-economy, they are a way of conveying the Mazu people’s imaginations of, and engaging with, present-day changes. This paper argues that religion is no longer the dominating factor in these pilgrimages. The source of power of pilgrimage comes not only from engaging with deities, but also from politics and economy. Mazu provides us with an excellent example of reflecting what pilgrimage is.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/71-4.pdf,71,2009,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Exploring Ethnic Interaction and Culture Reinvention from Perspectives of Exchange: A study of Miaoli Atayal in the Early Japanese Colonial Period,Mei-Hsia Wang,"exchange, ethnic relation, reinvention of culture, Japanese colonization, Miaoli, the Atayal","How “exchange” works as a mechanism to link social sub-systems has been discussed by many anthropologists. Mauss emphasized society as a totality: economy is not independent of kinship, religion and politics, but rather all of these four aspects are considered as a whole. He, however, neglected to consider how the same form of behavior may have different meanings according to local contexts, and what the dynamics of social change involve. This paper investigates the transformation of capitalism from locals’ viewpoints of exchange. The meaning of exchange in local contexts is firstly considered, especially, how exchange connects and transforms relationships among different levels. Further questions follow, including how the locals perceive the exchange process and measure the value of objects, and whether images of money synthesize several meanings and themselves embody history in Atayal society. My previous research suggested that the Atayal have not become alienated from each other and from their products by changes. In deciding whether to become involved in growing new crops, they are not solely influenced by questions of market price and stability, but they also take into account how the new crops fit into their traditional understanding of work and the values they place on it. As my previous research focused on one community only, I try in this paper to further explore the transformation of capitalism in wider contexts. This research, therefore, combines the perspectives of historical and area studies to focus on issues such as various ways of exchange in different periods and areas, creation of social relationships and culture, and the agency of history.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/71-5.pdf,71,2009,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Cultural Identity, Ecological Conflict and Ethnic Relations: Discourse on the Traditional Territory by the ‘Amis of ‘Tolan",Su-mei Lo,"Traditional Territory, Indigenous Community Mapping, Amis, ‘Tolan, Development","This paper aims to discuss the local response and influence generated by the“Traditional Territory Movement” and “Indigenous Community Mapping” in the Amis society of ‘Tolan on the eastern coast of Taiwan. Through this survey of a series of environmental movements, we see how the new landscape constructed by the local Amis people interacted with their original socio-cultural value system. Moreover, members of the society consolidated their cultural identity during the course of these various mass protests. After experiencing ecological destruction prompted by development projects and conflicts over different environmental management maneuvers within the village community, the Amis society is confronting the dilemmas of traditional ecological knowledge versus environmentalism as well as having to build a consensus on future development. In the end, this paper points to the potential crisis of the re-marginalization of Taitung Houshan and its indigenous people when the call for eastern coast development was at its height.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/72-1.PDF,72,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Acculturation of Ancestral Rituals: The Case of Taiwanese Residents in Osaka,Chia-chi Huang,"Taiwanese residents in Osaka, acculturation, ancestral ritual","People who migrated from Taiwan to Japan face issues concerning aging and death at some stage. How do those Taiwanese people determined to make Japan their final home practice ancestral rituals? Most of the literature regarding ancestral rituals by foreign residents in Japan, discusses identity and the preservation of their native rituals. More important, however, is their orientation toward Japanese culture. Therefore, this paper looks at how values concerning ancestral rituals have changed by analyzing cases of Taiwanese residents in Osaka. Whereas Taiwanese residents in Japan do not show their ethnic identities overtly in ancestral rituals such as funerals or, altars, Korean or Chinese residents in Japan exhibit their ethnic identities through their rituals. It is not necessarily the case that all of the Taiwanese residents in Japan do the same. Some of them, for instance, inscribe their native names in gravestones. “When it comes to Kako-cho,” a Buddhist ritual item literally meaning “ancestral book” and usually containing ancestral names, however, Taiwanese residents do not write in their ancestral names. Instead, they simply put their names in. This clearly displays their identities as the first generation of Taiwanese residents in Japan. By not binding themselves to follow their native rituals, it seems that they try to adopt Japanese customs in accordance with Japanese society.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/72-3.PDF,72,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

Public discourses attribute the high C-rates to the demands of women. According to my fieldwork, the Taiwanese medical system itself is responsible for high C-rates. Taiwanese hospitals enforce a significant amount of medical interventions that increases C-sections through social, psychological, and biological processes. Aware of these intervention practices, women request a C-section out of fear of “suffering twice”, or in other words, trying to deliver vaginally but ending up having to have a C-section. I will re-interpret maternal requests of C-sections within this context.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/72-4.PDF,72,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Social Meaning of Ritual Tooth Ablation Behavior in Prehistoric Taiwan: A Case Study at the Shihchiao Site from the Iron-Age Niaosung Culture,Hung-lin Chiu,"tooth ablation, spatial analysis of burials, tooth crown measurements of genetic inheritance, anti-attrition, preauricular sulcus","The tooth ablation ritual in Taiwan dates back to 4,500 years ago and has been reported all around the island from the Neolithic Age, the Iron Age and within the most recent 400 years. Such time consecutiveness is rarely seen in other parts of the world. Written records of different meanings of the ritual are found only in recent ethnographies. Thus, due to a lack of written records of rituals in prehistoric Taiwan, this research was conducted both with reference to ethnographies and within the context of archaeology and physical anthropological studies. In addition, this research examined 50 skeletons with tooth ablation features from the 162 skeletons found in burials from the Niaosung period, Niaosung Culture in the Shihchiao site, Sinshih Township, Tainan County, Taiwan. The relevance among gender, age, types of teeth ablated and presence of preauricular sulcus (experience of pregnancy) is worked out through archaeological analysis of burial placement and physical anthropological methodology while the social meaning of the ritual is reasoned out from an analysis of tooth crown measurements and genetic inheritance. This research found that at the Shihchiao site, the tooth ablation ritual was performed mainly on teenage and young adult females, with both maxillary lateral incisor and canine teeth ablated symmetrically. There is no positive correlation between tooth ablation and pregnancy experience. Nevertheless, pregnancy experience correlates with the placement of females’ burials. The analysis of tooth crown measurements for genetic inheritance shows that ablated females include some who were genetically related and others who were not, which proves that tooth ablation does not label the social group of the females. The above analyses indicate that tooth ablation is highly correlated to adulthood and marital status, and that it is a unique rite of passage for females. The appearance of tooth ablation can also be given various meanings during the course of her life.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/73-1.pdf,73,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Illness Experiences and Medical Encounters: Exemplified by the Case of Evergreen Health Center,Chen-Hsin Lo,"illness experience, alternative medicine, spontaneous gong, therapeutic process","This paper analyzes illness experiences and medical encounters of an alternative medicine group—the Evergreen Health Center in Hualien City, Taiwan—which mainly accepts cancer patients. This group consists of a center host, patients and their families. They live together at the Center for a few days, use a prescribed diet and a “spontaneous gong” as primary methods of convalescence. The illness and medical experiences of these patients originate essentially from the uncertainty of the effects of institutional medicine, and unpleasant physician-patient relationships. Nonetheless, they still reveal a seemly helpless, but not totally hopeless, “Days must pass by!”, attitude. Thus, they seek the relief of alternative medicine from this Health Center. Through illness narratives, this paper finds that these patients reflect current medical knowledge and social institutions, and presents a re-evaluation of illness experiences toward personal sentiments, daily behavior, and conventional values. This paper discovers that in this health center the healer, patients, and family members constitute a religious, ethical, technical, and ritually significant therapeutic process. It is this multi-dimensional therapeutic process that encourages the patients to not only construct meaning to their illnesses but also create meaning to their lives.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/73-2.pdf,73,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Social Analysis of Psychiatric Insight : An Ethnographic Observation,Shu-Chung Lii,"Insight, clinical perspectives, socio-cultural perspectives, conceptual history, cultural psychiatry, psychology, linguistics, medical anthropology, ethnographic study, contextual analysis","Clinical insight has been one of the main features differentiating the normal from the psychiatric abnormal. However, the common and pervasive usage of this concept has been built upon some ambiguous, intuitive and commonsense definitions. Not until recently have some theoretical elaborations of this concept been successfully made, such as Anthony David's tri-dimensions model or Ivana Markova’s semiotic model of insight. Nonetheless, these re-conceptualizations of clinical insight have still ignored the greater socio-cultural dimensions and meanings contained in the phenomenon of clinical insight. This study integrates critical perspectives from conceptual history, cultural psychiatry, psychology, linguistics and medical anthropology, and brings the complementary emphasis of socio-cultural concerns into the new conceptual development of clinical insight. Through the ethnographic presentation and analysis, this study points to the fact that the understanding of the clinical judgment of psychiatric insight has to be achieved by re-embedding it into the clinical context where it occurs, and that this clinical context is deeply embedded within and connected to the much broader multi-layered socio-cultural and historical contexts. This study suggests that only through this sort of multiple re-contextualization, with an emphasis on socio-cultural dimensions, can the current debate and obstacles to the conceptualization of clinical insight be surpassed, and a deeper understanding of the complex phenomenon of clinical insight be arrived at. It is also suggested that the ethnographic re-contextualization of the phenomenon of clinical insight can serve as a window to the better awareness and investigation of the broader social and historical process behind the phenomenon of clinical insight.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/73-3.pdf,73,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
A Dialogue between Daoism and Anthropology: A Study of Purification Ritual in Taiwan,Wei-ping Lin,"ritual, anthropology, Daoism","This article discusses the relationship between Daoism and local religious practice by means of a purification ritual, “zhuyou jingwu” (lit. boiling oil to purify houses). I start by illustrating how this ritual is recorded in Daoist literature and performed by Daoist priests. I then describe how it is practised by local people in southwest Taiwan. I analyze how the ritual, when practised by ordinary people, is intertwined with the Chinese concepts of place, body, and gender, and how the important Daoist cosmology involving a center surrounded by four directions is embodied by the local spirit medium. In this way, I show the shortcomings of previous research which sees Daoism as playing an exclusive role in providing the structure for local religion. This article, in contrast, elucidates how Daoism, local belief, and Chinese cultural concepts simultaneously interact in this purification ritual to expel evil power and rejuvenate the local society.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/73-4.pdf,73,2010,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Daily Life Experience: Bodily Experience of the Emptiness,Hsun Chang,"sensory experience, bodily experience, emptiness, common sense, local biology","This paper discusses the bodily experience of “emptiness” of Han Chinese in Taiwan using C. Geertz’s concepts of common sense and local knowledge. The term “emptiness” is widely used both in present day Taiwan and in traditional Chinese medical texts. This provides the possibility for the study of “local biology”, a term derived from Geertz’s local knowledge. “Emptiness” can refer to a feeling of fatigue or a pathological depletion as well as a state of mind or a physical exhaustion. It can also refer to an environmental wildness or supernatural evil. This paper will focus on the folk beliefs and folk healings of emptiness using material from fieldwork.

"Boredom, Everydayness and the Institutionalized Flirting and Courting of the Hmub in Eastern Guizhou",Mei-ling Chien,"institutionalized flirting and courting, everydayness, bodily experience, Hmub, Eastern Guizhou","The local Miao term rat is used commonly to express personal feelings-- boredom, dullness, or having nothing to do -- in the daily life of the Hmub villagers in Eastern Guizhou. In contrast to the bustling of seasonal festivals or rites, rat represents a specific kind of bodily experience and feeling related to the work and leisure of Hmub that fully displays the tone of everydayness. With regard to its content, situation or meaning, boredom is often considered a distinguishing feature of people’s everyday life and work in industrial or capitalized society, or simply, the West. In the highland Hmub villages, which are still based on agricultural production but have a close relationship with the local commercial market economy, is the rat of the villagers any different from the feeling of boredom in the industrial Western society? If so, what are the differences? This paper is based particularly on the ethnographic data of my field notes and diary written from 1998 to 2000. I will describe and analyze the iut fub, institutionalized courting or flirting, of Hmub youths and the features and transformation of their boredom, personal feelings and experiences of rat in the context of work and leisure in Fangf Bil village. Finally I will discuss the agency of iut fub, which for the Hmub young villagers is not necessarily followed by marriage.

"From the Bodily Feelings on the ""Wei"" of the Ancient Chinese Gentleman",Liang Ting,"body, bodily feelings, wei, outward demeanor, ritual","Wei（威）in ancient Chinese society plays an important role. The wei of gentleman can make subjects obey, establish ethical standards, and steady the country. Therefore, the Book of Songs said ""With reverent (wei) care of his outward demeanor, One will become the pattern of the people"", the Analects also said "" A gentleman not being steadfast is not able to command respect (wei)."" This essay tries to clarify three aspects of the wei of gentleman using the concept of bodily feelings. Firstly, wei owes to the sway and potential for inflicting punishment which is converted into the prestige of gentleman which he should be “imposing without being fierce."" Its nature is a physical reception, and in everyday life, it could have the political ramification of causing others to ""stand in awe and yet feel love"". Secondly, bodily feelings were molded out of dress costumes and difficult, precise bodily movements, the so-called ""three thousand rules of demeanor"" which contained complex rules of rituals and appearance. Thirdly, the idea that ""rules of propriety can be compared to the human body"" states that in the Zhou Dynasty the bodily experience of earlier people was transformed into a ritualized corporality. The bodily feeling of wei is the result of perception of and by this ritualized corporality, and has the function of identifying qualified people. Therefore, through analysis of bodily feelings of wei, we can see the concrete results of the interaction of cultural symbols and the physical body in ancient China.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/74-4.pdf,74,2011,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
More or Less：Marital Fertility and Physical Management in Late Imperial China,Ping-chen Hsiung,"Fertility rate, reproductive culture, medicine, technology","Whence or whether human reproductive behavior has ever been entirely “natural” is a topic much debated in modern demography. The presumably “natural” sex drives, and the procreation that follows, as far back as recorded history may serve as meaningful witness, hardly ever coincide with human wishes to reproduce. Added to these other socio-economic and cultural conditions, we see ample room for intervention and manipulation. The enduring wish to exert some kind of control over the purely biological reproduction generates a variety of beliefs, knowledge, and skills, which influence ways of copulation and conception, as births were accorded more or less frequently as those under “natural” conditions. Human motivation and the resultant techniques are thus at the very core of the questions to be confronted when we deal with the term natural fertility regime （NFR）. In sex and reproduction, the Chinese, like others, never pursued simply the naturalist tendencies. Historically, they are known as preachers and practitioners of particular and well-articulated views on this biological process. The following essay examines the socio-cultural factors as well as the medical technology that may have had either a positive or a negative effect on fertility patterns in late imperial China. The demographic concepts of NFR, and marital fertility rate（MFR）are particularly intriguing given the complexity of reproductive behavior in historical China. On the one hand, socio-cultural considerations had long come into play regarding people’s notions and habits of coition, as well as their decisions in child-bearing. More importantly, dating from very early times, medical knowledge and technical devices were available for altering nature’s course in the timing and the number of births.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/74-5.pdf,74,2011,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Bodily Experience within the Transformation of Dwelling Forms between 1949 and the1980s,Chijeng Kuo,"bodily experience, space commodification, socialist reform, state intervention, overcrowding","In the context of China’s contemporary urban history, Shanghai was the first city which had a great number of its housing units produced as commodities. Most of the dwelling forms were built for sale or to rent, and the majority of the living experiences were invoked and came into being by something made for real estate promotion. Therefore, dwellers’ aspiration towards comfort and convenience often coincided with some distinguishable outward appearance and demanded for higher price in the housing market. That was the reason even the new bodily experience of comfort and hygiene in contemporary cities could be related to the modern infrastructure and public utilities, but they often were correlated to visual images about the detached bungalow-like housing units in suburbs. Judgments about dwellings manifested themselves within the factual living experience and visual contact with the outward appearance. After 1949, Shanghai’s original housing market encountered stringent intervention from the new socialist state. Housing units were no longer supplied by the market but were rather built and distributed by the state’s new institutes according to new building regulations. People’s dwelling selections were limited to specific kinds of dormitories which the socialist state could provide. Even more, insufficient housing investment not only reduced the housing supply but also compelled the existing housing units which had been built for sale or rent (e.g. the Shanghai Lilong) to be entirely distributed by the state. Consequently both the housing allotment from the state and self accommodation by the users resulted in dwelling forms being given new functions and meanings under the prevailing egalitarian ideology. This paper focuses on Shanghai’s housing development after the socialist reform of the 1950s and explores: 1. The transformation of dwellers’ bodily experience that occur when all the housing units were distributed by the state and could no longer be obtained from the market or were necessarily appropriate to one’s affordability and how the human body and the interactions between family members accommodated themselves to the new socialist scenarios. 2. Given a high level of state intervention, what is the difference between categories of bodily experience and their connotations and those of the period when market forces ruled. Through an understanding of the transformational process of dwelling forms and the collective living experience, this paper attempts to interpret the correspondence between bodily experience, material conditions, and the social process within the period during which socialist ideologies prevailed.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/74-7.pdf,74,2011,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Mother Ghost Wants to Get a Human Son-in-law: Ghost Shrines and Human Greed in Taiwan,Wei-ping Lin,"Chinese Religion, Ghost, Ghost Shrine, Material Culture, Greed","This article, inspired by material culture studies, reconsiders the concept of ghost by means of a detailed analysis of a particular type of religious architecture, the ghost shrine. By studying its material composition, naming and rites, I show how ghosts are conceived of as asocial and individual beings, gathering mostly in single-sexed groups. This forms the basis for understanding the incidence of a “ghost mother wanting a human son-in-law”. In contrast to previous research which describes human-ghost relations from the perspective of the trouble-making and threatening roles of ghosts, this story importantly shows that it is not only ghosts who take advantage of human beings. Motivated by greed, humans also cross the spatial boundary separating humans and ghosts to coerce the latter for their own selfish ends. By dramatizing the gender contrast of ghosts and humans, the story of the ghost mother epitomizes people’s ridicule and condemnation of human greed.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/75-2.pdf,75,2011,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"From the “Twenty-five Ladies’ Tomb” to a “Memorial Park for Women Laborers”: Gender, Religion, and the Politics of Memory in Taiwan’s Urban Renewal","Anru Lee, Wen-hui Anna Tang","Feminist movement, popular religion, politics of memory, urban renewal","This essay looks at the recent renovation of the Twenty-five Ladies’ Tomb, and examines the politics of the feminist movements and the politics of memory as they are expressed through different meanings of female ghosts, in southern Taiwan. People who were involved in the renovation process included the families of the deceased “twenty-five maidens,” the Kaohsiung city government, and feminist groups in Kaohsiung and elsewhere in Taiwan – most notably the Kaohsiung Association for the Promotion of Women’s Rights – all of whom had different considerations and therefore diverse expectations regarding the future and purpose of the tomb. In Specters of Marx (2006), Derrida uses the idea of “specters” and “haunting” as consequences of historical injustice and tragedy metaphorically but powerfully. These two elements come together in our essay as well. However, the “ghosts” in our accounts are more literally ghosts with whom some (if not all) of our ethnographic subjects interact. They appear, express their sorrow, and demonstrate their grievances. The reestablishment of peace and order essential to residents of both the living world and the afterlife thus hinges upon mutual understanding and close collaboration between them. Yet, as meanings are constantly contested, so is the nature of the deceased’s requests. The different interpretations that the (living) socio-political forces give to the deceased’s needs open up new terrains of contestation for the memory of the past and the rights and obligations at the present.

During the last two decades, planners transformed Taiwanese cities as they repurposed unproductive urban spaces to make way for leafy parks, fine public buildings, and other markers of Taiwan's ""cultural"" status. In Lukang, a large 18th-19th century cemetery was redeveloped as land for the new town hall, a hotel project, and a pubic park. When accidents and acute health problems beset contractors and administrators, rumors suggested that both the ghost objects and the new public spaces were out of place. Material practices of working with remains such as bones created the possibility of ethical relationships with the dead, which urban renewal disrupted. Yet, stances on this disruption do not follow a simple account of state projects and popular resistance. Rather, both desires for and anxieties concerning public amenities are entangled by the elided presences that act through haunting.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/75-4.pdf,75,2011,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Research Impacts of Establishing an Online Database for the Study of Lapita Pottery,Scarlett Chiu,"Lapita pottery, database, motif analysis, cultural resource management","Established in 2005 through international collaboration, the long-term project of the study of Lapita pottery is aimed at collecting and integrating information on important Lapita sites and pottery findings to both establish a standardized method for coding vessel forms and motifs for further comparisons among island groups, and to provide a platform for researchers to conduct cross-regional comparisons online. This database contains detailed information about several important Lapita pottery assemblages, including attributes such as morphology, petrographic and chemical composition, motif, and forming technique. The ultimate goal will be to provide researchers with large amounts of accurate data with which to test or modify different hypothesis regarding issues such as exchange networks, pottery-making traditions, migration routes, etc., that have been the focus of study on the Lapita Culture Complex. In this paper I will first present the efforts of previous scholars to establish a systematic method of comparing pottery assemblages, the difficulties they faced, and how those difficulties may be resolved by the establishment of an online database. Preliminary results of motif comparisons are also presented based on data from 60 sites have now been verified and entered into the database as a test run and also as an example of possible research directions for the near future.

Context Analysis of Archaeological Materials: Case Studies in Agate Beads and Stoneware Jars in Southeast Asia,Kuang-jen Chang,"Exotic objects, agate beads, stoneware jars, material culture, context analysis","The purpose of historical archaeology is not to pile up newly discovered objects but to provide contextual information for unearthed materials. One of the key issues in Taiwanese historical archaeology is how exotic goods were integrated into the existing meaning and value systems of local objects in Taiwan pursuant to participation in the early modern world system. This question could produce valuable historical knowledge through the systematic analysis of archaeological materials with contextual information. This paper serves two purposes: firstly, to examine how exogenous materials become treated as indigenous objects via the archaeological and ethnographic studies of agate beads and stoneware jars in Southeast Asia, two types of objects commonly discussed in Taiwanese and Island Southeast Asian historical archaeology. Continuing advances in the archaeological sciences constantly renew our understanding of unearthed objects. However, ethnographic evidence shows many Southeast Asian societies treat those cherished agate beads and stoneware jars as indigenous objects passed down from their ancestors, even though those same objects were shown by scientific analysis to be exogenous materials. This tells us that archaeological study should be more than the scientific analysis of an object’s geographic and technological origin, it needs to take into account of socio-cultural theories in order to appreciate the role and meaning of exotic objects within specific contexts, which is the ultimate goal of archaeological study. The second purpose is to examine how value could be studied archaeologically by utilising information on the spatial distribution and association of discovered objects. Recent advances in the study of material culture have improved archaeological understanding, which suggests that the valuation system could be reconstructed by looking at the differentiation of usage in specific contexts. In other words, a reasonable reconstruction of a value system could be made by a detailed context analysis, especially the spatial pattern of discoveries and association of objects. This paper attempts to approach this issue using two case-studies: one of pottery in the Bronze Age of East Mediterranean, and another dealing with trade ceramics found in early modern Luzon in the Philippines.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/76-2.pdf,76,2012,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

"Comparative Analysis of Glass Beads Used Among Austronesian Groups in Taiwan： Some Thoughts on Forms, Values and Materiality",Chia-yu Hu,"glass beads, form, materiality, aesthetic preference, symbolic value","This paper explores the material features and symbolic value of glass beads in Taiwan. Glass beads had been widely used by many Austronesian indigenous groups from long ago. Since glass-making technology was not developed locally, most glass beads were traded to Taiwan from overseas and introduced into indigenous societies via various sources and paths during different periods. However, many indigenous people collected glass beads and stringed them together to make necklaces, headdresses, bracelets, anklets and earrings, or stitched them on clothes as decorations. Due to some special material features such as their ease of transportation, freedom for combination, shiny gloss, and richness of colors, glass beads operated not only as ornaments, but also as media for exchange, or signs of values and powers. Based on material collections, written records and photographic images, this paper compares and analyzes regional variations of forms, color patterns, symbolic values, wealth status, and sacred powers of glass-beaded objects used in Taiwan. It shows that these variations reflect divergent modes of aesthetic preferences, cultural selections, as well as interactions between cultural groups in different regions. Furthermore, the traces of internalization and transformation of values and meanings of glass beads through times are also examined.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/76-5.pdf,76,2012,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

This study looks at the reaction between calcareous temper and pottery paste at different temperatures, and the associated influence of salt in the firing process. It is found that the decomposition of calcite occurs when the firing temperature exceeds 800℃. The subsequent products, calcium hydroxide and carbon dioxide, lead to expansion and bloating in the paste, and therefore the breaking of the pottery vessel. Thus adding calcareous temper makes it difficult to fire pottery at higher temperatures. However, such a situation can be controlled by adding appropriate amounts of salt to the clay paste.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/77-1.pdf,77,2012,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

In “Chiti Chenter”, most of international tourists spent their stay with familiar western situation. The “whole town” of Luang Prabang, well-known ancient capital in central Laos, is core administrative location of previous kingdom under colonial domination. In the present this particular city corner is full of foreign tourists as well. In addition, the northernmost Muang Sing is also welcome by Euro-American visitors based on the existence of a mini-former local palace, colonial legends and imaginations on historic wars and drugs popularly planted in borderland alongside China and Myanmar. One of the most important things shared by these three touristic spots is that it is easy to find western food services for international tourists. The tourists within “authentic” Lao traditional situation always unwittingly entered into “food / menu-directed bubble” to have their home-style food for acquiring feeling of comfort or even safety. Nostalgia becomes enjoyable in such particular “home out there” situation. A complicated phenomenon of separation between western tourists and local Laotians, inside bubble and outside bubble, and western food and Lao food indeed reflects factual irreconcilability in today’s Lao touristic arena. To summarize, a plural situation with less communication between locals and outsiders has appeared during the processes of adding Laos in the hot destination list of world tourism.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/77-2.pdf,77,2012,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Embodied Experiences of Spiritual Inspiration of Christians and Followers of Folk Religion in Taiwan: An Approach of “Ways of Sensing the World”,Yi-jia Tsai,"embodied experiences of spiritual inspiration, religious experience, Christianity, folk religion, everyday life, ways of sensing the world","This paper explores embodied experiences of spiritual inspiration of Christians and followers of folk religion in Taiwan. It proposes an analytical framework of perceiving, discerning and transforming based on the approach of “ways of sensing the world,” which argues that embodied experiences constitute the very basis of our everyday existence. Embodied experiences form the character of our cultural life and the meaningful contexts of all of our socio-cultural conduct. The “everydayness” of everyday lives is best represented by these kinds of “ways of sensing the world.” Religious culture can be explicated by looking at their different ways of sensing the world, which are in turn constituted by networks of sensing categories. This paper also discusses the relationship between everyday ways of sensing the world and extraordinary ways of sensing the world. It points out that the embodied experiences of spiritual inspiration are rooted in the system of everyday ways of sensing the world. On the other hand, these extraordinary experiences are characterized by the quality of wonder that breaks through the boundaries of the everyday culture system. The embodied experiences of spiritual inspiration therefore are capable of rewriting and transforming the original cultural system.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/77-3.pdf,77,2012,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Transculturation: Visual Encounters between Jesuit Catholics and the Natives in Hsinchu,Wen-ling Lin,"Jesuit missionaries, transculturation, catholic church, the materiality of image","This paper traces the missionary trails built by foreign Catholic priests who spread the gospel in the 1950s in the Eastern Hsinchu Deanery, leading from Hakka areas to aboriginal tribes in the mountains. I interpret the missionary work of foreign priests as transcultural encounters between the global and the local. Missionary work connects at least two groups of people of different nationalities. People who are actively involved in the process have to negotiate, cooperate, or mediate the divergences of cultural background and social conditions, which materialize in the mediation or transference of different situations and interactions. Tangible, visible and touchable visual cultures are the media that narrate those experiences across time and space. This research applies the materialist turn in visual studies by viewing photos and architecture as objects of life stories that embody or reveal transcultural processes and actions of boundary drawing or constitution. Based on such premises, this research examines the religious activities inside the churches built on the missionary trails, and explores the transcultural contacts as materialized in pertinent visual objects (including the landscape, architecture, inner designs, ritual ceremonies and archival photos of these churches) co－created by Catholic priests who entered the area in the mid－ 20th century and the natives who had settled in the areas in Hsinchu.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/77-4.pdf,77,2012,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Counter-Social Relationalism in Chinese Civilization,Hsueh-cheng Yen,"relationalism, stranger, social evolution, ladder structure, dualism","In their eagerness to find a sharp contrast between China and the West, Fei Xiaotong and Lian Shuming contended social relationalism or guanxi to be the very fabric of Chinese society. This article argues against this thesis not so much by denying the existence of social relationalism as by questioning its appropriateness in understanding China as a complex society. I point out that the most important structural problem for every complex society is to establish social order among strangers, people who are not personally related. This is substantiated by the Chinese social theories of the Warring-States period more than two thousand years ago. Most of them claimed the calculation of kinship distance from one’s self was the cause of social chaos. To solve the problem of strangers, they proposed a ladder model that evaluated people by an absolute standard of merit. The relative positions on the ladder provide coordination for social interaction. This article also compares the ladder model with the dualistic model most prominent in the modern West.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/78-1.pdf,78,2013,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Clothing Practices, Mimesis, and the Politics of Appearance among the Austronesian Rukai in Taiwan",Weining Cheng,"mimesis, clothing practices, personhood, power, individuality, Rukai","Using the ethnography of the changing styles of clothing oneself among the Austronesian Rukai in Taiwan, this essay examines the dialectical interplay among the introduction of commodities, images of personhood and an aesthetic of power. On communal occasions of dance, Rukai commoners dress themselves in locally made commodities with designs similar to that of the nobles’ clothing, and consider these to be mimetic acts. From the view of commoners, gorgeously-dressed nobles are an image of beauty which personifies their potency and virtues. With the enhancement of beauty in appearance by means of mimesis, commoners think that they are consequently empowered to transcend the here-and-now conditions of their existence. Therefore I argue that commoners’ mimetic acts aesthetically challenge the nobles’ monopoly over the form of expression concerning an ideal image of personhood in the community. Due to the prevalence of clothing commodities and aesthetic judgments towards appearances being influenced by education as well as the media, the objects the Rukai mimic have become diversified, meanwhile even the desired images of personhood and sociality among the residents are heterogeneous. Significantly, the Rukai imitate the clothing style mostly used by the Puyuma on the grounds that they want this style-embodied ‘otherness’ to make them unique and distinct from other residents in the village. What is more, the face that the Rukai mimic, the distant image of a power-holder on the TV, implies not only the enactment of self-transformation into a desired personhood, but also how such an image allows them to approach the utopian image of imagined sociality beyond their reach.

"Festival, Statue of Virgin Mary, and Place-making: A Case Study of a Catholic Village in Taiwan",I-chun Chen,"festivals, place-making, identity, Christianity, the study of Plains Aborigines","This paper is concerned with how local Catholics perceive Bamkin as a particular place by re-enacting the annual festival of the Virgin Mary every December. I argue that local believers incorporate themselves with the statue of the Virgin Mary of Bamkin through intimately physical engagement in the festival. And central to the ritual process are bodily experiences by which a sense of oneness with the statue and the place is invoked. However, as Jonathan Amith(2005) suggests, place-making always involves place-breaking. I also discuss how the symbol of Virgin Mary represents internal differences and conflicts among Bamkin Catholics. At the end, this paper proposes a challenge to the study of Plains Aborigines in Taiwan. Based on the assumption of ethnicity, researchers construct images of reified and objectified “Pingpu” cultures, furthermore, these academic discourses form an essentialized identity among “Pingpu” people. But the case study of Bamkin shows that converting to Catholicism provides a chance for local people to resituate the past, redefine the present, and reformulate a different identity.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/78-3.pdf,78,2013,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Church as “Women’s Community”: The Feminization of Protestantism in Contemporary China,Chen-yang Kao,"Protestantism in China, women’s community, feminization, gender relation, the Cultural Revolution","This paper explores the feminization of Protestantism in China today. Although the predominant presence of women in Protestant churches is well known by scholars, few researchers have explained and explored this phenomenon. Based on field data from Pingtan, Fujian, this paper indicates that Christian women’s social networks and religious activities constitute the vitality of the local Protestant life. They inhabit a social space similar to what Margery Wolf calls the ‘women’s community’. Sanctifying this social space, Christian women acquire the means to transform traditional gender relations and challenge a patriarchal order. For men, Protestant religious life has become an increasingly female domain irrelevant to their concerns and interests. This article further argues that the women’s community had its inceptive stage under the Cultural Revolution when communal, male-dominant religion was harshly repressed, and privatized, women-dominant religion was able to survive. Women’s community, therefore, can be seen as a continuation of Protestant underground house groups under the Cultural Revolution.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/78-4.pdf,78,2013,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

We attempt to explore intra-site spatial patterns in order to set up a foundation for further understanding the Wansan people’s daily life. Three steps are proposed to explore possible locations of the houses. First, we inspect whether the postholes form any visually recognizable groups on maps.

Application of GIS to Catchment Analysis and Landscape Room: A Case Study of OLP III/IV Cultural,Ting-yu Liu,"OLP III/IV phase, catchment analysis, cost surface, viewshed analysis, fauna remains, landscape room","Through the calculation of cost surface, GIS enables site catchment analysis to move beyond models with simple geometric circles to allow for irregular ranges by considering the different costs of transportation over landscapes. Taking both terrestrial and marine data into consideration, the different accessibility of resources within a site catchment can be understood in more detail, and archaeologists can use this information to create a model of interaction between sites and their environment. According to the location of six sites from the O-luan-pi III/IV phase, and through the analysis of cost-surface and viewshed of digital elevation model (DEM) in GIS, I divide the coastal area of the O-luan-pi peninsula into four different landscape rooms. Two landscape rooms are separately occupied by a single site, and the other two landscape rooms each have two sites within them. It would seem natural to expect that catchments of sites sharing the same landscape room would overlap and that the activities of the sites on land would influence each other on land. However, through the analyses of current and wind data, it appears that sites sharing the same landscape room have different accessibility to terrestrial and marine environments. These variations may have led those sites to maintain their independent site catchments rather than competingwith each other for resources.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/79-4.pdf,79,2013,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

The most prevalent hair colour for Atayal tribal groups combined was X which is black brown (men 45.4%, women 38.2%). Second was X-Y, the colour in between X and Y (men 35.3%, women 31.3%). Y is black which ranked third (men 8.4%, women 19.8%). Dark brown (W) ranked fourth. For the Saisiat tribe, X-Y was the most prevalent (men 48.5%, women 43.5%) followed by X (men 44.1%, women 34.8%). Third was Y (5.9%) and W was found in only a few men. However, in women, W(13.0%) was third and Y (8.7%) was fourth. The number of Atayal hair samples examined for hair form was 705 (men 271 cases, women 434 cases), and that of Saisiat hair samples was 82 (men 59 cases, women 23 cases). Hair form was examined and classified according to Martin’s textbook. The most prevalent hair form was “straight-fine” regardless of men or women, seen in 80 to 95% of the samples. “Straight-coarse” hair was seen in 5-9.5% for men and only 0-5% for women. “Flat-wavy” hair was seen more in women (8.8-13.0%), than in men (3.4-6.3%). “Wide wavy” hair was seen mostly in women, but in a low percentage (0-5.9%).",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/79-8.pdf,79,2013,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Challenges for the Realization of Indigenous Land Rights in Contemporary Taiwan: A Regional Study of Indigenous Reserved Land Trade between Indigenous and Non-indigenous People,Da-wei Kuan,"indigenous land rights, indigenous land, indigenous reserved land","The purpose of this study is to reveal the present situation of the trade in Indigenous Reserved Land between indigenous and non-indigenous people, and to show how it challenges the realization of indigenous land rights in Taiwan. In 1993, Taiwan’s indigenous peoples’ “ 3rd Return My Land Movement” shifted the goal from increasing the amount of Indigenous Reserved Lands, the land parcels reserved for the “ protection ” of indigenous livelihood since the Japanese colonial era, to the recognition of inherent indigenous sovereignty. The movement prompted a certain response from the government after 2000, and inspired a wealth of studies of indigenous traditional territories covering much wider areas than the current Indigenous Reserved Lands. This marks a millstone for indigenous land rights in Taiwan. However, on the other hand, the relatively low concern with Indigenous Reserved Land in the past decade led to an ambiguous understanding of the present situation of Indigenous Reserved Lands under rapidly changing circumstances. Combining the method of ethnographic study with the Geographical Information System, this study reviews the transition of land use in the researched area, describes the newly emerged broker mechanism, and analyzes the newly shaped political-economic structure dominating land development in indigenous townships. In conclusion, this paper re-examines indigenous land policies and makes suggestions as to how to realize indigenous land rights in contemporary Taiwan.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/80-2.pdf,80,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Exploring the Transformation of Capitalism from Perspectives of Waya: Economic Changes in a Sediq Community,Mei-hsia Wang,"domestic mode of production, peasant economy, articulation, work, capitalism, the Sediq","This paper investigates the transformation of capitalism from the Sediq viewpoints of production. Economic anthropology is concerned with how the different mechanisms of exchange, production and consumption work to integrate different aspects of society. In regard to the issue of production, this research deals with the capitalist mode of production, domestic mode of production, peasant economy, and the articulation of different modes of production. The meaning of production in local contexts should be considered firstly, especially, how production connects and transforms the relationships among different levels. Further questions follow, including how the locals perceive the process of production and measure the value of objects, and whether the images of work, land and money synthesize several meanings and embody history itself in Sediq society. The Sediq began to grow cash crops and were incorporated into the capitalist market system in 1960s. In deciding whether to become involved in growing new crops, they were not solely influenced by questions of market price and stability, but also had to take into account how new crops fit into their traditional understanding of work and the values they placed on it. In addition, traditional social relationships continued to influence the planting of commercial crops, for example, in the exchange of labour and the lending of land. The use of money, like the choice of new crops and exchange of labour, reflects the fact that the Sediq have not been alienated from each other and from their products by these changes. This research, further, reveals how cultural production and transformation involve each other. On the one hand, the Sediq’s key cultural concept –waya, which is thought to constitute a person’s identity – still influences their acceptance of new crops and the transfer of new agricultural technology. On the other hand, a person’s identity and social relationships changed when the community was drawn into the capitalist system and cash crop production. Objective social structure and subjective individual consciousness then become related dialectically.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/80-3.pdf,80,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Cultural Industry and “Ethnic-Tribal Cultures”: Two Case Studies of the Pinuyumayan (Puyuma) People, Eastern Taiwa",Wen-te Che,": Pinuyumayan (Puyuma), cultural industry, community-making, cultural form, ethnicit","Since the 1990s, Taiwan has experienced a new form of nation-building under the Integrated Community-Making Program launched in 1994 by the Council for Cultural Affairs, Executive Yuan. Celebrating the value, variety, and strength of local cultures and their products, the Program attempted to construct and redefine the distinctive features of Taiwanese society that were obscured by the framework of Chinese culture imposed by the KMT regime from the late 1940s. In addition to its socio-political implications, however, the Program also had its economic purpose. Since the early 1970s, due to the development of industrialization in Taiwan, many young people gradually migrated to urban areas, leaving their elders and children behind. As a result, rural areas in Taiwan were at risk of “social disorganization.” In order to solve the economic and social problems, the Program encouraged each community to rebuild a new sense of community and construct its local distinctiveness through local products, like crops, crafts and scenic attractions, to bring in tourists. In other words, the products of each community should be specifically localized in order to distinguish themselves from coarse mass products. At the same time, the significance of cultivating communal consciousness was emphasized. Nevertheless, the situation was different for the indigenous peoples on the island. In contrast to their Han-Chinese counterparts, “culture,” or “ethnic culture,” became the main concern for the development of the indigenous peoples. Although living side by side with the Han-Chinese people in the same communities, particularly in the plains areas, indigenous peoples were usually in a disadvantaged position with respect to access to social resources. Therefore, in order to counteract the unfavorable conditions, indigenous peoples often set up different kinds of associations and substituted “(ethnic) tribe” for “community” to differentiate themselves from the Han-Chinese. This in turn would enhance ethnic boundaries and ethnic cultures in specific senses. Drawing on studies among the Puyuma and Katratripulr of the Pinuyumayan people (officially referred to as “the Puyuma”) in Eastern Taiwan, this paper discusses the development of cultural industry in these settlements since the late 1990s. In the course of more than one decade, some differences have developed between them. For example, the Katratripulr have succeeded in getting government funding for local projects and developed their own kinds of cultural industry, while the Puyuma are still trapped in disputes over how to develop their culture. Even so, with more problems emerging, the Katratripulr are beginning to consider how to develop cultural industry without making their traditional social institutions less effective and even damaging their internal unity. Having compared the similarities and differences between these two settlements, I argue that consideration of the development of cultural industry and the formation of ethnic culture in particular should take seriously their respective socio-cultural and local contexts. Furthermore, taken together, I suggest that these two case studies exemplify the complicated way in which the constitutions of “tribe” and “culture” have been implicated in the development of the capitalist economy in terms of the tourist industry in eastern Taiwan.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/80-4.pdf,80,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"From Rituals to Theatre, Cultural/Creative Industry and Cultural Heritage: The State, Shamanism and Gender among the Kavalan and the Amis (Taiwan)",Pi-chen Liu,"shamanic rituals, performance, cultural industry, cultural heritage, state, shamanism, gender, Taiwan indigenous peoples","This paper presents a diachronic, multi-sited ethnography to comparatively examine how shamanism, gradually fading away among the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan, underwent stunning, contradictory, and differing forms of revival in the process of the democratization at the end of the 1980s. Taking examples of shamanism as practiced in the two geographically and socially intimate locales of PatRungan, a Kavalan village in Hualien, and Lidaw, a Northern Amis village, this study analyzes how their respective rituals became stigmatized as “witchcraft” under the influence of the centralized power of the Nationalist government and its policy of separating religion from the state in the 1950s. At the same time, different responses arose from the two villages’ interactions with the state: as the Kavalan village of PatRungan began to be Christianized, its mtiu (shaman) gradually became marginalized. The sikawasay (shaman) beliefs in Lidaw, however, became integrated with the folk beliefs of the local Han, and the age at which people could become a recognized shaman shifted from childhood to adulthood and even middle age. In terms of gender, there was a wave of female shamans and a pan-feminine tendency arose in the division of the offering of sacrifices. These shifts and adaptations in shamanistic beliefs reflect an intersubjective agency that allowed shamans to continue to have public influence and religion to remain an important mechanism for the coalescence of village consciousness and the construction of a collective identity. The results of this comparative research highlight different responses and actions in these two neighboring villages in which there are numerous interactions and variables in the relationships between shamanism, shaman, gender and the state. Around the time martial law was lifted in Taiwan, the Kavalan initiation and healing ritual (kisaiz),defunct for 30 years, made a reappearance in modern theatre, being recreated in the form of the “traditional culture of the past.” This performative transition was both a field of internal conflict and negotiation after the religious conversion of the village, and also a means of negotiating the transformation of its tribal society into an “ethnic group” within the democratizing state. Under the impact of globalization in recent years, the state, through its cultural policies, has redefined the song and dance of Kavalan shamanic rituals, developing them into a kind of economies of signs and turning them into a cultural tourism industry in the form of performance. These songs and dances have left the scope of the village’s control and been appropriated for use by the government, becoming a fluid national sign and traditional intellectual property to be actively protected by the state. On the other hand, the shamanic ceremonies in Lidaw have a considerably different place in their new social context than the Kavalan kisaiz. They have not developed in the direction of cultural performance or cultural industry, and were registered as cultural heritage under the category of belief in 2009. This paper asks: what kind of political negotiation led to this? Have shamans in the two villages, as they possess ritualistic capital, returned to a position of power as a result of Taiwan’s new multiculturalism and indigenous tourism?",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/80-5.pdf,80,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Practices of Love and the Making of the Affective Subject among the Rukai of Taiwan,Weining Cheng,"love, personhood/gender, affective agent and affective subject, modernity, Rukai","This paper examines the category of love and its practice along with other kinship practices as the Rukai encounter, cognize, understand, re-construct, and experience the facets of modernities embodied in capitalism and Christianity. Firstly, I scrutinize both the Rukai category of love and its practices with regard to gender, personhood, courtship, marriage, and procreation in order to demonstrate the salience of love/affect in their constructs of family and kinship. Secondly, I discuss how, owing to the collective (Bourdieusian ) illusio of domestic and kinship reproduction among the older generation, parental authority and social norms intervene in how younger couples express their feelings and even to whom they should express their feelings. I therefore argue that a person is seen as an affective agent in the sense that while he/she bodily enacts the practice of love, their parents are truly the cause of their children’s practice of love. Ever since the 1980s, though, many Rukai youngsters have moved to northern Taiwan to engage in wage labor, where they earned and made a living in settings containing people from different ethnic groups. Meanwhile they were able to choose their own lovers as well as express their feelings by means of novel expressive forms such as love letters and pop music, and even to force their parents to accept their marriage partners by way of pre-marital pregnancy. In this sense the youngsters make and manifest themselves as affective subjects. On the other hand, with the introduction of Christianity in the late 1950s in Taromak, the church strongly promoted God’s love as the ontology of human love and the view that sexuality and desire are only legalized in marital relationships, thereby ideal marriages and domesticity were created in the earthly world. However, what the Rukai learned from the liturgy was the epistemological division of love and sexual desire, the latter being confined within marital relationships. Their knowledge as such leads to the re-classification of both the practices of love and to marital relationships and then endows these practices with a moral hierarchy. In practice, for several Rukai who did not accept the Christian liturgy, the expression of desire shown in pre-marital or extra-marital affairs is tantamount to the free expression of one’s feelings, which is what humanity means to them in the contemporary contexts.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/80-6.pdf,80,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

But despite the high level of theoretical discourse, problems still exist. We think that it’s necessary to reassess the historical impact of the traditionalist paradigm inherited from the authoritarian era, and to carry out a critique of identity politics through a focus on two aspects: cultural representation and exhibitionary discipline.

Generally speaking osteoarthritis was a common disease amongst WST individuals who had reached the age of 20. The presence of osteoarthritis is not surprising as the disease has been noted to afflict a large number of individuals in contemporary sites. However, the identification of osteomyelitis and tuberculosis (TB) is extremely surprising as such diseases have never been identified in Neolithic sites before. Periodontal disease, fracture, and degenerative joint disease were observed among the ten individuals. However, the incidence of these diseases is comparatively low (20%, 20%, and 10%, respectively).

A Reappraisal of the Prehistoric Relationship between Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands: From the Perspective of Geographic Consciousness,Yu-pei Chen,"Archaeology, the Ryukyu Islands, Prehistoric Relationship, Ancient Geographic Consciousness","The prehistoric relationship between the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan has been long known but rarely discussed before recent years. This is due not only to differences between the two areas and their languages, but also to an academic preference to research relations between marginal areas and civilization centers. According to the present viewpoint, there are few specific prehistoric artifacts showing a relationship between Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. However, such a lack of relations between the two adjacent places is itself something worth explaining. For indeed there are some special phenomena related to prehistoric studies on the Ryukyu Islands that may provide important clues for understanding the relationship between Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands. This paper begins by reviewing the important archeological phenomena and questions related to the Ryukyu Islands. Secondly, it tries to explain the lack of contact from different perspectives based on the archaeological data. The conclusion focuses on the fact that for the Ryukyu Islands, cultural stimulation came primarily from the north, eventually forming a geographic consciousness at the same time that various ethnic groups were forming on Taiwan. For the ancient Ryukyu Islands people, this deepened the mental distance and hindered more intimate connections from being made with Taiwan.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/81-2.pdf,81,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Comparison between Shimotabaru Culture in Ryukyu Sakishima Islands and Neolithic Culture besides Hualien River in Taiwan Eastern Coast: New Data from the Technical Choice Viewpoint,Jou-chun Lu,"Ryukyu Islands, eastern coast of Taiwan, Shimotabaru Period, Neolithic period, comparison research, technological choice","The Ryukyu Islands can be culturally divided into North, Middle and South Ryukyu. Based on the style of artifacts, the Neolithic cultures in North and Middle Ryukyu had close relationships with the Jomon Culture in Kyushu. On the contrary, the Neolithic culture in South Ryukyu, the Shimotabaru Age, is quite distinctive from the culture in Middle and North Ryukyu. Some artifact types of the Shimotabaru Age are similar to Neolithic cultures in Southeast Asia, like partially polished stone adzes or Shimotabaru Pottery. As the West Pacific island closest to the Ryukyu Islands island arc, many scholarshave debated the relationship between South Ryukyu and Taiwan. Some researches tried to seek similarities between artifact types from South Ryukyu and Eastern Taiwan. However, such research usually emphasized certain types of artifacts, such as the aforementioned partially polished stone adzes or Shimotabaru Pottery, and discussed cultural interactions based on these limited attributes. At the same time, contextual issues were seldom taken into consideration. Thus the importance of culture holism is usually overlooked. Furthermore, arguments were usually influenced by differences between classification systems in the academic traditions, in Taiwan and Japan. Artifacts with the same attributes might be placed in different classes, thus making comparison between two areas much more difficult. In this paper, I will first deal with problem in typology, discussing definitions of kinds of artifacts in the two areas to make sure artifacts compared without the influence of differences between the classification systems belonging two academic traditions. Using technological choice theory, which takes material culture, culture structure, circumstances and human agency into consideration, this paper discusses cultural relationship through choices made in material culture. Therefore I will compare the similarities in types and styles of artifacts between the two areas, then interpret the choices made in prehistory in terms of similar artifact types, different ratios of artifacts types and circumstance conditions. Finally I discuss the prehistoric subsistence and cultural relationships of these two areas.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/81-3.pdf,81,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Ritual, Performance and Culture: A Study of Tanadui in Taketomi Island in Okinawa",Chi-fang Chao,"Okinawa, Taketomi Island, Tanadui, ritual, cultural performan","This paper combines archival and ethnographic material to explore how the islanders in Okinawa practice their traditional culture to maintain their unique existence and identity under the modern nation-state. The author discusses the notion of ‘cultural performance’, the formation of a core tradition and its contribution to the ‘consciousness of a common culture,’ in order to analyze the ritual and performance of Tanadui, the most important annual ritual in Taketomi Island in the Ya’eyama region. The tradition of performing arts, including songs, music, dance and drama, as the devotion in ritual Tanadui in Taketomi originated from the indigenous belief in utaki (sacred groves) widely seen in the Ryukyu islands. The ritual has developed into a cultural complex embracing religion, history and art, all of which were influenced by the regime of the Ryukyu Kingdom. In the ritualistic performances, the music, sound, vernacular, movement and other symbolized vehicles and signs of feeling all give concrete contents and forms to the Taktomian culture via the annual practices. The devotional performing arts hence have become a recognizable regional tradition. Generations of different origins view, participate, perform, teach and then step off the stage, thereby vitalizing the rich tradition with their efforts. This collective autographic performance thus allows the multi-layered culture and history of Ryukyu to be presented to themselves and the onlookers. Through this case study, the author will also illustrate the exchange-orientation of island culture, especially in relation to the mainland culture. Existential differences between the two inspire imagination, anticipation, interpretation and in turn self-awareness, all of which has been reflected in the cultural production of the islanders. While they draw their borders in the seemingly endless ocean, they also clearly perceive and welcome the power and influences of the greater land. Through the mediation of history, cultural factors of different origins interact with each other and are used by the Ryukyuan islanders. This uniquely integrated island cultural chain has been formed by the combined forces of dynamic temporal stratification and spatial diffusion between the mainland and the island.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/81-4.pdf,81,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
A Nation without Nationalism?: A Preliminary Inquiry into Iha Fuyū’s Nichiryu Dōsoron,Rwei-ren Wu,"nation without nationalism, nationalism, oppressed and small nations, Nichiryu Dōsoron, Iha Fuyū, Ryukyu nation, Ryukyu nationalism, Lin Ch’eng-lu, Movement for the Establishment of the Taiwan Parliament, Taiwanese nationalism","Iha Fuyū (1876-1947), the father of modern Okinawa studies, established the existence of the Ryukyu nation intellectually through his studies in historiography, folklore and linguistics, but denied Ryukyu nationalism politically by advocating the Nichiryu Dōsoron (discourse on the common ancestry of the Japanese and the Ryukyuan peoples). Was he arguing for what Julia Kristeva characterized as a nation without nationalism? Or was he trying to insert some special project of difference/identity construction into his seemingly paradoxical discourse on Ryukyuan history? This paper seeks to offer a preliminary answer to this question by analyzing the intellectual structure of Iha’s Nichiryu Dōsoron. This paper argues that Iha’s Nichiryu Dōsoron was a variant of the nationalism of the oppressed and small nations. In its prototypical stage, the historical proposition of the discourse attempted to elaborate a political line whereby the Ryukyuan people could preserve their national subjectivity with the help of external forces through a strategy of creating commonality out of differences between Ryukyu and Japan. This mode of thinking reminds one of the so-called “motherland faction” (sokokuha) of Taiwanese exiles in wartime China who sought to rely on China for liberating their homeland. The later form of Nichiryu Dōsoron abandoned the false hope of relying on external help, strengthened the otherness of Japan, and further deepened the national imagination of Ryukyu. Intellectually it became a much more radical nationalism, and yet politically it was an impracticable nationalism. The emergence of nationalist thought, however, did not mean the formation of a nationalist movement. There was no Ryukyu nationalist movement before the end of WWII, even though an ideology of Ryukyu nationalism did appear in the form of Iha Fuyū’s roundabout thoughts. From the perspective of nation-formation, Iha’s discourse only signified an early stage of nation-formation in Ryukyu-Okinawa. In this limited sense, one may well agree that the Ryukyu as nation that Iha portrayed in his Nichiryu Dōsoron was indeed an (imagination of the) nation without (the movement of) nationalism.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/81-5.pdf,81,2014,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

After depicting these three social movements, I scrutinize Japanese nationalism and Okinawan distinctiveness, including why people in Okinawa insist on non-violent means of resistance. In the process, I hope to show that, through peaceful, anti-war, non-violent means and goals, Okinawans interact with and connect to Japanese mainlanders and other social movements worldwide. This makes social movements in Okinawa remain vigorous, despite pressure from the Japanese government and Japanese nationalism.

Except sparse records in Shiji, Hanshu and Huayangguozhi, our understanding of Dian all comes from archaeological discoveries, especially those large and complex cemeteries. Since 1950’, archaeologists excavated many large Dian cemeteries, including Jinning Shizhaishan, Jiangchuan Lijiashan, Chenggong Tianzimiao, Qujing Batatai, Chengjiang Jinlianshan and Kunming Yangfutou. These cemeteries usually include several hundred burials with abundant burial goods, however, the complexity of burial goods make difficulties for researchers. Some scholars applied several statistic methods in the analyses of large Dian cemeteries for understanding their social structures, social hierarchies and gender relations but none of them pay attention on spatial relations among burials.

"The Statue of Mazu, Appropriation, and the Discussion on Watson’s Concept of “Standardization”",Hsun Chang,"the cult of Mazu, statue, standardization, body experience, appropriation","After 1980 temples of folk religion in China were renovated, statues were re-sculptured and worshipped. A giant granite statue of Mazu erected on the island of Mei was a turning point for these newly sculptured statues. It symbolized a new style of modern city planning and spirit of universal fraternity. This statue was designed to indicate the transformation of Chinese folk religion from the superstitious, feudalistic, to the folkloric, tourist, and finally, to intangible cultural heritage. This Mei Mazu statue were largely imitated and appropriated along the northern and southern China coastal cities, and even in overseas Chinese communities and Taiwan. This phenomenon implied not only artistic appropriation, but also the complicity of the central and local government officers, local elites, designers, carvers, and folk believers. The author will discuss James Watson’s concept of “standardization” and argue that when the state tries to standardize a religious cultural model it involves visual and artistic appropriation and complicity from the local society among other cultural strategies.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/82_2.pdf,82,2015,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

In the work of Maurice Freedman, popular religion in Fujian is always associated with patriarchal lineages with a strong local sense. This paper analyzes the differences between the newly developed earth deity temple in Xianyue Mountain and traditional village temples in terms of: 1. the rebuilding of the spiritual power by a fairy-like woman, 2. the impact of Taiwanese businessmen, and 3. the celebration of the transnational cultural festival.

The Imagination and Practice of Social Networks: The Southeastern Yunnan Hmong as Both Cross-border Ethnic Group and Catholics,Nai-wen Wang,"social networks, cross-border ethnic group, geopolitics, conversion, Hmong","For a long time, references to the Hmong have highlighted the ways in which a people who have moved so far and frequently are able to regroup in a new place. There are few scholars focusing on what happened to the Hmong when they adopted Catholicism, and in turn, how they adapted to the new regulations of Catholicism while their traditional style of belief was changed or forbidden by this new foreign religion. For the Hmong living in Tao Village, the imagination and practice of their social networks have different collective representations due to different historical conditions. A class teaching the Miao writing system class also created a chance for cross-border connections and allowed for new relationships to be imagined among the Hmong people. However, this new possibility was limited and stopped by contradictions in and out of the church, and the collectiveness which inspired the development of Tao village withered away in the process. The dilemma of the church came about for a number of reasons. Firstly, in the past, the spreading of Christian religion among the Hmong in this area caused some riots which made the neighboring governments keep an eye on these people. Secondly, because the influence of Vang Pao is still a sensitive issue in this area, the mainly Hmong church has to deal with this political condition carefully. Thirdly, the development of the market economy pushed the people to manage for their own social relationships. In other words, the gap between imagination and practice of social networks for the Hmong living in Tao village has not only been manipulated in their subjective consciousness but also influenced by the international geopolitics.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/82_4.pdf,82,2015,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Kinship, Ethnicity and Landscape: The ‘bone (ɻu35)’ of the Pumi Speaking People in Yunnan, China",Wen-yao Lee,"Pumi, bone, kinship, ethnicity, landscape, ontology","Through discussing the concept of “ɻu35” of the Pumi speaking people living in Yongning Township of Ninglang Yi Autonomous County in Yunnan, China, this paper illustrates how the mutual engagement of humans and their physical surroundings contributes to the forming and understanding of “kinship” relation, social grouping and ethnic identity of the local people in the Tibetan borderlands. I introduce how Pumi people understand the relations between houses in their local community with the idea of “ɻu35”, how individuals realize the continuity of the house by accomplishing one’s life in the space of the house with one’s ashes(ɻu35) buried in the mountains that exhibits the specific identity of the house and its endurance, and how the ritual practices and arrangement of the house and village space form the configuration and understanding of the landscape that composed the context of this process. Thus, I explain how the ‘bone’ concept in Pumi, the idiom of “ɻu35”, expresses the relation and identity generated through the interaction and mutual engagement between the reproductive gendered human bodies and the durable physical surroundings people inhabit, and I argue that the concept of “ɻu35” implies an identity and form of relations which build upon the meaningful landscape loaded with human practices and past lives as its ontological basis. I suggest that this relational and ontological form generated by the mutual formation of human and physical surroundings may be shared by other native peoples who use the concept of ‘bone’ to express the relation of their essential social groupings in the Tibetan borderlands, and that this ontological form is the basis of the interaction and mutual understanding between different peoples in the region. Compared with the self-designated ethnic category of the Pumi speaking people that represents an identity unified by the “ɻu35” and embodies an ontology that assumes the continuity of social identity with the human body, physical house and the surrounding landscape, the official category of “Pumi Zu” rests upon a biological ontology with a spatial scheme assuming that the formation of social relation is independent from the physical surroundings. Therefore, I suggest that an ethnic name should not be seen as solely a name for categorizing peoples, but rather as the reification of an ontological process that implies specific ways of connecting human and physical surroundings and through which social relations and identities are defined.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/82_5.pdf,82,2015,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Tracing the Dynamic Contour of Sourness,Hsueh-cheng Yen,"dynamic contour, sour, contextuality, empathy, mapping","In the modern Chinese language the word sour (酸) is used to describe a wide variety of sensations. This paper shows that the cross-modality of sourness is based on a schematic of pointing upward or shrinking to a point from a flat plane. Thus Chinese experience sour not only as a taste but also as the sourness of sensitive teeth, sore muscles or ear-piercing sounds. From the idea of dynamic contour, this paper argues that sour should not be viewed as a simple and rudimentary sense category but rather can be further analyzed in terms of its schematic contour. Moreover, sourness is not to be identified through comparison and negation from other taste categories. Instead, it is by tracing the outline of the dynamic contour that Chinese identify sourness. This leads to a criticism of the idea of contextuality which dissolves the meaning of a thing to its relationship with other things. By tracing the dynamic contour of our sensations, we experience the world through the flow of time. This stands in sharp contrast to contextual paradigm that freezes time and identifies a thing by its relation to others things in a synchronic system. This paper also argues that dynamic contour may be a key to empathy, i.e., we grasp what others feel through mapping the dynamic contour of their senses. And the cross-modality in dynamic contour provides reference points for verification.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/82_6.pdf,82,2015,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Understanding Hong Kong: Democracy and Party Politics in Popular Movements,Xiang Biao,"popular movement, externally-oriented democratization, party-state system, leadership","The Umbrella Movement in late 2014 in Hong Kong manifested not only tensions between “democratic Hong Kong” and “authoritarian Beijing”, but more importantly deep contradictions within China’s own party-state system. The Umbrella Movement was a convergence of multiple social campaigns that sprung up over the last ten years under the banner of democracy and political autonomy. This article traces how the notions of democracy and autonomy in Hong Kong emerged from its special historical and geopolitical contexts, and how those conditions have now changed and therefore complicated the pursuit of these goals. This article then asks why the “one country two systems” approach, a consensus among major stakeholders thirties years ago, ran into deep trouble when China opened up and its economic integration with Hong Kong intensified. I suggest that it is the changing nature of the Communist Party and its relation to the state, and not just the lack of democracy, that caused the current crisis. Hong Kong deserves special attention not because it is distinct from the mainland, but precisely because it manifests contradictions in China as a whole in a particularly sharp manner.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/83_2.pdf,83,2015,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Raising Umbrellas in the Exceptional City: Encounters with the ‘Other’ in Liminal Spaces,"Shu-mei Huang, Ian Rowen","Umbrella Movement, Hong Kongers, social drama, hospitality, Hong Kong","Many of the hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong people who initially joined the Umbrella Movement had the relatively straightforward goal of “protecting the students.” Extensive media coverage soon represented protest participants as passionate, brave, and inclusive, although Hong Kong people have rarely been noted for their hospitality. In contrast to the pessimistic narratives of recent years, characterized by phrases such as “the city is dying,” the Umbrella Movement’s proliferation of citizen-journalism and artistic production raised the widely-debated possibility that “Hong Kong people have changed.” Based on ethnographic observation of the movement from late September through November 2014 and content analysis of popular and social media, this article examines the ways in which Hong Kong people articulated such changes. It pays particular attention to the role of “hospitality” in shaping discourse and extending the time-space of the Umbrella Movement as social drama.

Directly Facing Party-state Power: A Response to Xiang Biao’s Discourse on Umbrella Movement,Iam-chong Ip,"Hong Kong, Umbrella Movement, Chinese Communist Party, neoliberalism, democratization","Professor Xiang Biao’s commentary on Hong Kong’s “Umbrella Movement” is a rare attempt among academics in mainland China to discuss Hong Kong. However, in his discourse, the role of the Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong’s democratization is almost invisible and the historical process by which Hong Kong and China’s political developments have increasingly diverged is not discussed. This process began in 1989 when the communist regime violently repressed the demands and agenda for democratic reform and continued in the 1990s as the state pushed forward neoliberalism in order to obtain leadership and legitimacy. It is also the history of the “incompleteness” of Hong Kong’s political development. This article further points out that Xiang’s narrative of contemporary China from which his discourse on Hong Kong is derived evades the history of the party-state power reshuffles and its politico-economic operation in reality. In contrast, it embraces the myth of party-state leadership. Xiang’s article serves as an example of various theories and myths of the Chinese Communist Party-state.

“The Masses”and the“Party”: Can We Theorize the Occupy Movement through China’s Revolutionary Discourse?,Haoqian Chen,"Hong Kong, Umbrella Movement, Chinese Communist Party, mass, party politics","In his article “Understanding Hong Kong: Democracy and Party Politics in Popular Movements,” Xiang Biao considers the overall relationship between the Umbrella Movement, the governance crisis in Hong Kong, the “one country, two systems ” approach, and the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and uses the theory of “the masses”and“party politics” from China’s socialist revolutionary discourse to understand why the movement happened in Hong Kong and what possible innovations it could bring to China’s politics. This essay argues that, however, Xiang’s attempt rendered his analysis too PRC-centric, for instance he heavily draws on the experiences of the 1989 Tian’anmen Movement in predicting the development of the Umbrella movement, and takes changes in CCP as the central cause of various developments. As a result, he fails to recognize that his appropriation of the notion of “the masses” in China’s revolutionary discourse is removed from the Hong Kong reality.

Knowledge of a culture’s technological system can lead to more questions and thus to more research of the social aspects of a culture. The aim of this particular research was to study the manufacturing technologies of ceramic in the Ta-Pen-keng, Yuan-Shan, Zhi-Wu-Yuan, and Shi-Shan-Hang cultures in Taiwan by understanding how technical choices were made in these cultures.

In fact, the model works as a testable and verifiable hypothesis. The predictive model has its roots in settlement spatial pattern and site catchment analysis and is greatly enhanced by GIS technology. Ancient people were closely tied to natural and cultural environments, by understanding these factors, archaeologists will be able to narrow their searches to potential archaeological sites. This paper demonstrates an application of GIS using an example of a site predictive model in an archaeological investigation for the Hong Kong high-speed railway construction project. In terms of natural environmental factors, aspects such as food, fresh water, raw materials for stone artifacts, landscape, elevation, soil, and wind are regarded as significant determinants for ancient people when choosing their living or settlement locations. For cultural factors, this paper is based on a comparison between existing Ming-Qing villages nearby and Ming Dynasty settlement remnants unearthed within the railway depot site to discuss how ideological systems affect settlement location",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/84-2.pdf,84,2016,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
What is “Anthropological” about Anthropological Fieldwork?： Reflections on its Epistemology and Ethics,Kai-shyh Lin,"fieldwork, ethnography, methodology, ethnographic writing, fieldwork ethics","As “fieldwork” becomes more popular than ever among researches in other social sciences, anthropology suddenly finds itself increasingly losing control over one of its most cherished trademarks. With the dissipating of so called “primitive cultures”, the traditional intensive study of a single site in the field has become a questionable methodology to cope with a fast moving world. Anthropology needs to go back to its methodological foundation to reflect on its nature and its ethical commitment to conduct “Anthropological fieldwork”. This essay argues that there are at least four basic experiential dynamics at work in the fieldwork situation that continue to shape our discipline’s epistemological and ethical orientations. They are: the ethics of an open and relational self, uncertainty in locating subjectivities, a highly critical and reflective sense of politics, and the labor of emotion and ethics. Thus, we reject efforts to differentiate anthropological fieldwork from other empirical studies with various formalistic criteria, such as long duration or fluency in native languages, and also argue against those post-modernist attempts to obfuscate the unequal conditions intrinsic to any ethnographic writing by deploying various textual innovations. We insist that fieldwork should continue to be the central endeavor in learning and pursuing knowledge of the unfamiliar. In conclusion, we outline some of the most pressing challenges to anthropological fieldwork in the contemporary world and our possible responses.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/84-3.pdf,84,2016,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
‘Marketized’ Adolescents: When Adolescents Become the Social Mediating Mechanism for Migrant Wage Labor,I-chieh Fang,"adolescents, migrant workers, life course, development, global market","After China's reform and opening up, the individual’s life course once again experienced a new standardization process. Specifically, the contents, tasks and challenges over the course of childhood, youth, and old-age have been changed according to the economic rearrangements. As powerful consumers, the main group of migrants and indicators of social changes, youth and adolescents are especially prominent and worthy of attention. This article analyzes the situation of young migrant workers and the ways in which they dream and make decisions about their future in a Taiwanese-owned factory in Shenzhen. It explores how the changing concept of adolescents has become a social mechanism for justifying the marginalization process which has taken place among contemporary Chinese rural youth and their in-between, belong-no-where situations. At first glance, ‘marketized adolescents’ encourages Chinese youth to become more and more individualistic, emphasizing individual freedom and individuality. But in fact, it is less about the individual’s development and more about the way in which state, society and market justify its change after marketization and obscure the resulting social inequality and discrimination.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/84-4.pdf,84,2016,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Marginal Situation and Survival Strategiesof the Tibetan Bonpo in India,Yu-shan Liu,"marginalised peoples, Tibetan refugees, Bon religion, Bonpo, national discourse","This article presents a study of a marginal group among the marginalized, the Tibetan Bonpo in Dolanji, North India. The Bonpo are a distinctive religious minority within the Tibetan refugee population. Contemporary Bon and Buddhism share many similarities when it comes to philosophy and forms of ritual practice. However, adherents of the Bon religion believe that their founder is different from that of Buddhism, and assert that Buddhism has incorporated some elements from the earlier Bon religion as it developed within Tibetan societies. When the Tibetan Government-in-Exile was established in North India in 1960, it emphasised the Buddhist heritage as being central to Tibetan national identity. This discourse, which represents the Tibetans as being homogeneously Buddhist, marginalized the adherents of the Bon religion. As a result, the Bonpo have been compelled to adapt, whilst resisting the marginalization of their religious identity and the constraints embedded in their refugee status. Based on fourteenmonths of ethnographic fieldwork in Dolanji in 2007-2009, this article illustrates how the Bonpo adapt to multiple factors of marginality which constantly reinforce their powerlessness whilst, at the same time, attempting to challenge and change their marginal situation. It provides a different angle from which to understand the way of life of Tibetans in exile. Through the lens of the Bonpo, this study rethinks the role of religion in constructing Tibetan identity and in framing the official discourse of Tibetan nationalism. It is contended that it is from the margins, where people have to struggle to live under conditions determined by the centre, that the contradictions embedded in the dominant discourse and the ambiguities which constantly contest the practice of social relationships can be better approached and observed.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/84-5.pdf,84,2016,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Internet Matsu: Online Community and the Reimagination of Place,Wei-Ping Lin,"internet, community, place, imagination, the Matsu Islands","This article takes the Matsu Online internet platform as an example to discuss how social media have turned Matsu into a new place. From a peripheral set of barren islands to a military frontline during the Cold War, Matsu in the 21st century has been reimagined in various ways as a place with inherent value and meaning. In this paper I discuss three aspects of this dramatic transformation. First, I investigate the interface of the Matsu Online platform and show how different forms of media, such as texts, songs and images, have deeply embedded Matsu Online in the lives of people living there. In this way, a new internet community beyond the physical boundaries of the islands has been formed. Second, I discuss the interactivity of Matsu Online and explain how netizens can break up the tightly knit social networks on the islands to develop new online selves. Even if these selves cannot totally transcend traditional social relations, they have already ranged beyond the geographical limits of Matsu, connecting Matsu with Taiwan and China. The netizens take on independent existences which are able to cross the space-time boundaries of the Taiwan Strait, engage in social activism, and fight to reclaim land occupied by the state during the period of military reign over the islands. Third, I examine how netizens describe and imagine various aspects of Matsu through the Matsu Online blog, and show how internet technology has transformed Matsu from a military bulwark against communism into a place with its own inherent and unique value.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/85--%E5%AE%9A%E7%A8%BF2--p17-50.pdf,85,2016,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

The first involves the exploration of a possible contemporary culture and society, and the second deal with drastic changes in the media system. Within this context, the wildfire-like Maker Movement has become the momentum which links up these two issues. By virtue of social networks and the juxtaposed involvement of the real and the virtual, the bottom-up innovative power of the Maker Movement is predicted to completely alter the structure of traditional industries as well as the social, technological and educational dimensions of the world within the next decade. The Maker generation embraces the participatory culture, introducing technological practice into the intersection of human beings and technologies, and also embodying it in the interaction between communities and technologies. Against this background, this article applies anthropological methodology together with the phenomenology of technology, and the discourse of the participatory culture, to the case of FabLab Dynamic as a strategy for the investigation of the open source movement, connections within social networks, the collective imagination of social design, and the juxtaposed embodiment of Maker technologies.

The contribution of C4-based foods to the overall diet seemed to be minor.

Take a Step Up: Research on the Stone Ladders of the Peinan Site,Chang-keng Yeh,"Peinan Site, LFS Site, stone ladders, building structure, pit house","There is still some question as to how exactly stone ladders unearthed from archaeological sites were used. This paper begins with an overview of this issue. The processing marks on the stone ladders is then discussed and combined with digital management to analyze how the stone ladders were used. Statistical analysis is further applied to extrapolate behavior patterns of the people who used the ladders. The usage angle of stone ladders at the Peinan Site is mainly between 40 to 60 degrees, and the vertical height is about 100 to 130 centimeters, which is approximately the height of a half-story house. Comparing this with the traditional residential building structure types of Taiwanese indigenous people, it is highly possible that some of the prehistoric building structures of the Peinan Site were similar to pit houses. By further combination with stone pillars, masonry circles and other features unearthed, we might get to know more about the settlement pattern of the Peinan Site.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/85--%E5%AE%9A%E7%A8%BF6--p.139-172.pdf,85,2016,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Networked Sociality of Migrant Workers: Mobile Connectivity, Narrative and Network among Wa Migrant Youth",Tzu-kai Liu,"networked sociality, mobile connectivity, social media, network, and Wa migrant workers","Troubled by poor economic conditions in their rural homelands in China’s southwest border areas, many Wa youth seek work in urban manufacturing districts of Guangdong Province in southeast China. They now rely on smartphones to connect with the social media site QQ. Through narratives and the sharing of online posts and forwarded messages, these Wa youth actively engage with mobile communications and interpersonal networking when on the move. Born in the 1990s, these Wa migrant youth also experienced the years of the booming development of the information and communication technologies (ICTs) in China. Their mobile networking and networked sociality are fragmented in that they are often prohibited from answering any phone calls and connecting to QQ during work hours or they have to discontinue using their QQ platforms after leaving the factories or returning to their homelands due to financial problems. Through the active use of mobile media, their networking ties are partly ethnic-constructed, partly class-based, and partly language-centered. They develop QQ chatgroups based on ethnic ties among Wa coworkers and villagers, who are from the same ethnic homelands or work in the cities. Moreover, they often share digital narratives of work fatigue, which are originally written by Han workers, on their QQ chatgroups. Finally, living in multilingual and multiethnic work environments in the cities, language use is another key aspect for understanding Wa migrants’ identity construction. Frequently, Wa migrant youth create unique phonetic changes in mobile texting and messaging to express their language-centered regional identities by typing the sounds of a regional Chinese variety and Wa using standard Chinese words. In this way, Wa migrant workers create a unique way to distinguish themselves from Han migrant workers.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/86-2.pdf,86,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Return of the ‘‘Real’’: The Social-Cultural Implication of Ingress,Hou-ming Huang,"Time, Space, Identity, Regional Hierarchical Organization, Research Method","Ingress, an augmented reality (AR) game, was developed by Google’s Niantic Laboratory in 2012. Our detailed literature review shows, though, that to date very few scholars have paid attention to the cultural and social significance of this game. Combining GPS technology in mobile phones and Google Maps with a virtual reality (VR) game and the real world, Ingress requires players to walk in the real world in order to occupy various virtual portals in the game world. This is the reason why the experience of playing Ingress is entirely different from that of playing all previous VR online games. This paper argues that the social and cultural significance of AR games is the return of the “real”. The influence of AR technology, taking Ingress as the exemplar, is explored in this paper from the following aspects: the return of space, the return of time, the return of the body, the return of identity, and the return of regional, hierarchical organizations. In all these aspects, we also try to clarify that the “real” that is returned to in Ingress is not the real as it exists without AR technology, which is why the word real is used with quotation marks.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/86-3.pdf,86,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Good Words Hurt Too: The Cyberdiscourse Against Same-Sex Marriage in Taiwan,Theresa Der-lan Yeh,"Cyberhate, hate speech, same-sex marriage, discursive strategy, separation of state and church","The anonymity and accessibility of the Internet has facilitated the way people promulgate ideas and beliefs and resulted in an unprecedented wave of biased and discriminatory speech in cyberspace. Its impact on policy issues and harm to disadvantaged groups has been widely explored since the end of the last century. This article analyzes cyberdiscourse attacking the same-sex marriage proposal in Taiwan in 2014 for its rhetorical strategies and imagined communal conceptions of marriage and homosexuals. The results show that although the anti-same-sex marriage discourse appeals to Chinese traditional values, it either appropriates the discursive strategies or translates the content and concepts from foreign hate group sites. This lack of local particularity illustrates the delocalizing effect of the Internet on today’s domestic anti-same-sex marriage campaigns and the ways they are heavily powered by transnational information flows via cyberspace.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/86-4.pdf,86,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

The Hidden Holy Grace: Development of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal among the Pinuyumayan (Puyuma) People of Eastern Taiwan,Wen-Te Chen,"Puyuma, Catholic Charismatic Rennaisance, personal spirituality, communal sociality, grace","This paper explores the Catholic Charismatic Renewal in a local church of the Pinuyumayan (Puyuma) people of eastern Taiwan which has caused disputes among believers and resulted in an internal schism by traceing its develop from the mid-1990s and focusing on why the Holy Spirit Renaissance resulted in such unexpected consequences. I argue two significant intertwining factors led to the church’s schism. The first, which might be common among Catholic churches, is that the members of the movement highlighted the individual’s holy grace and challenged the authority of the Church bureaucracy. Secondly, the situation further deteriorated due to the members’ lack of respect forthe Catholic elders, a social ethic for the Pinuyumayan people. They even abandoned ancestral tablets that had been installed in their households. At first glance, the members of the movement seemingly paid attention only to cultivating their personal spiritual life. However, when sharing their personal experiences and feelings during weekly prayer meetings, we see rather that they were trying to constitute a new life with their families and fellows. In this sense, the movement demonstrates how they sought to redefine the relationship between personal spiritual life and community involvement, the individual and the collective, the sacred and the profane, as well as religion and culture, in an attempt to balance personal concerns and community sociality in contemporary life.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/86-6.pdf,86,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

This paper examines what happens to Catholic festivals and rituals, both important mechanisms shaping the Bankim community, in the face of the cultural tourism being promoted by the local government during the Christmas season. The author suggests that the “Bankim Christmas Season” forms a public sphere in which local villagers project their differentiated social imaginaries and place identities in the ritual performances and material cultures. Moreover, their creative reactions toward commodified Christmas show not only local autonomy to resist official policies dealing with intangible cultural heritages, but also that a new sense of place is developing.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/87-1.pdf,87,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
A Study of the Material and Firing Reactions of Relief Dots on Ancient Greek Red-figure Pottery,Chia-Lin Hsu,"Ancient Greece, red-figure pottery, relief dots, black gloss, firing","Red-figure pottery （c.530-c.250 BCE） is one of the most representative objects of ancient Greek civilization. Inscriptions on the pottery preserve ancient Greek words, while paintings thereon reflect the images people had of gods and goddesses. The paintings also record several aspects of society and the life at that time. The technique used for the pottery has attracted scholars’ attention since the eighteenth century, and better accounts are still sought. This paper is concerned with the decorative relief dots on ancient Greek red-figure pottery. The relief dots are found to consist entirely of black gloss which could have been produced with ease during firing. This recalls the Greeks’ interest in convenient but precise techniques. Such characteristics helped this pottery technique to be learned and spread without much difficulty. Since the Greeks tended to be conservative toward customs and traditions, they passed this technique down from generation to generation. By way of trade and colonization it was brought to a wide area where the Greek culture reached. The technique was a symbol of the Greek civilization.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/87-2.pdf,87,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

Some of these sites are in inaccessible known areas and it is unlikely that they could be located by investigators on foot due to the difficult mountainous environment. The sites we are able to locate were often covered with thick vegetation, which requires massive energy and time to clear before any study can be done. Our research applies the airborne LiDAR to the study of the above-mentioned sites. We compared the site layout of Wun-lou, an abandoned Paiwan settlement, mapped by archaeologists in 2014 with the data provided by airborne LiDAR from the government, using GIS.

"The analysis of faunal remains and their spatial distribution in Litzuwei, southwestern Taiwan","Wei-chun Chen, Peiyu Chen","faunal remains, intra-site spatial analysis, consumption behavior, Dahu Culture, Niaosong Culture","The Litzuwei site, located in southwestern Taiwan, is a multi-component site including the late Neolithic Dahu Culture and the Metal Age Niaosong Culture. The systematic excavation of Litzuwei from 2010 to 2014 yielded abundant faunal remains of various species suitable for intra-site spatial analysis. This study analyzes the intra-site spatial distribution of the unearthed faunal remains from both the Dahu and Niaosong contexts. We then illustrate the contemporaneous and diachronic pattern of the utilization of faunal resources and compare consumption behavior between the two cultures. We aim to discern whether there was a diachronic change in (1) the degree of faunal resource utilization in terms of quantity and density, (2) various utilized species and their associated social meaning, (3) the usage of space within the site area, and (4) the context in which the faunal remains were deposited. The results show that the Cervidae and Suidae dominated the utilized species throughout the occupation history of Litzuwei, but the intensity of utilization of animal resources increased dramatically during the later Naiosong occupation. Additionally, the higher diversity of species we identified suggests that the Niaosong people had a broadened spectrum of animal resources acquisition. This study also points out that the spatial distribution of faunal remains shifted gradually toward the north and east of the site, indicating a slight change of activity area.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/87-4.pdf,87,2017,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
The Concept of the Liminal and Dramatic Studies: A Preliminary Investigation,Wei-jan Chi,"Tuner, ritual, drama, liminal, liminoid, communitas, structure, anti-structure","Anthropologist and social theorist Victor Turner had a two-way relationship with the field of drama. On the one hand, he borrowed the concept of drama from traditional Western theatre to develop his theories on ritual, social conflict, and cultural transformation. On the other hand, Turner’s close collaboration with Richard Schechner to explore aspects of performativity led to the rise of performance studies in the 1980s. The liminal, one of the key terms in Turner’s conception, is used to describe a particular phase of rituals in tribal and feudalistic societies. To differentiate similar occasions in industrial societies from tribal rituals, Turner proposed another term, the liminoid, which encompasses activities such as literature, art, theatre, sports, and musical concerts. Interestingly enough, whereas “the liminal” has been applied extensively in social studies, cultural studies, and performance studies, “the liminoid” has received little critical attention, if not been completely abandoned. The purpose of this paper is to discuss key aspects concerning the application of these two terms to the study of dramatic texts.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/88-2.pdf,88,2018,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

As scholars begin to examine this period in the greater depth, some have asserted that the worldwide reach of Maoist cultural-political projects also bears exploration. This paper responds to this increasingly acknowledged body of research, focusing on how a Sino-Burmese performing arts troupe, Five Golden Flowers, has appropriated the movement’s emphasis on revolution through music and dance, and engaged with its particular rhetorical strategies. Further discussion includes the new social arrangements and political environments that have reshaped this troupe’s Maoist revolutionary expression as troupe members migrated from Burma to Taiwan, and their ideals and aesthetics of dance in continuing to embody Maoism. My approaches to these issues illustrate several significant turns in recent developments in ethnomusicology, while also echoing some anthropological theoretical ideas such as “cultural intimacy” and “social poetics.”",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/88-3.pdf,88,2018,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Things, Senses, and a Fallen Dynasty: Discussion of Ming Loyalist Dong Yue's Feiyan Xiangfa",Hui-Lin Hsu,"historical anthropology, south china studies, Chinese history, structuring, Chinese rural society","Taking the materiality of incense as its focus, this article investigates descriptions of the making and use of incense in the 1651 essay collection Feiyan Xiangfa by the Ming loyalist Dong Yue (1620-1686). During the Ming and Qing dynasties, pleasure objects (wan wu) not only were symbols of literati’s aesthetic values and taste, but also means for expressing and containing feelings of grief and mourning, historical memory, and even political meaning. Dong's writing on the making and use of incense in Feiyan Xiangfa is inseparable from this historical and cultural context. Through reference to studies on the use of religious incense in the field of anthropology, this paper explores the transformations in sensory experience that take place in Feiyan Xiangfa as well as the material foundation of these transformations, the literary and cultural symbolic systems behind them, and finally their historical implications.

Doing History in the Field: Historical and Anthropological Studies of Southern China over the Last Three Decades,Ren-Yuan Li,"historical anthropology, South China studies, Chinese history, structuring, Chinese rural society","One of the most remarkable achievements of studies of late imperial China in recent years has been studies of local society that emphasize the bottom-up view and the use of sources from fieldwork and local documents. This approach can be traced back to the 80’s when social scientists trained by western academics cooperated with Chinese historians to study southern China, an approach usually labeled the “Southern China School” or “historical anthropology.” The central questions that these southern China researchers and the social scientists of their period faced were the same: how to understand social structures historically. What was different was that the southern China researchers were dealing with people more deeply (or least claiming to be) influenced by their historical past and having a longer history of interactions with state institutions. This article traces the core issues of this approach, including the historical process of structuration, and the role of local practices of rituals performance and state institutions in this process. It also discusses this approach from the aspects of historical process, historicity and historiography, which were dealt with by Emiko Ohnuki in her review of historical anthropology.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/88-5.pdf,88,2018,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Transformation, Intertwinement and Innovation: Religious Change among the Sediq",Mei-Hsia Wang,"conversion, cosmology, personhood, ritual, the holy spirit, the Sediq, waya, utux, lnlungan","This paper investigates how Christian cosmology and concepts of personhood have intertwined with the local Sediq social-cultural context during the process of religious change. Several Sediq concepts, such as ""waya"" (literally, words from the ancestors), ""lnlungan"" (literally, heart) and ""utux"" (a general term for spirits, ancestors, and ghosts), have multiple meanings, and have shown the dynamic quality of culture by combining with different interpretations under various circumstances that were influenced by capitalism and Christianity. Furthermore, they reveal how new notions and social order brought in by Christianity have reformulated local society in a new way. This paper shows that the process of church localization involves social-cultural interaction, in which church rituals, organizations and doctrines have been gradually comprehended and accepted by the locals, or, alternatively, has developed in a unique manner in a Sediq way. For instance, just as the importance of ritual language is emphasized in traditional rituals, so to have local people, in their encounter with Christianity, viewed hymns and prayers as having their own efficacy, and have even incorporated elements of church ritual language in traditional healing, rainmaking, and hunting rituals. The process of ""conversion"" is also closely related to social change. Alang Snuwil (春陽部落) is a community which was devastatingly impacted by resettlement under Japanese colonial rule, during the KMT period, it became more accessible to outside society and was further affected by capitalism, a result of which was that social conflict became more and more frequent. Discourses promoted by western religion such as ""a change of heart"" or ""repentance"" were helpful in reducing conflicts and jealousy among people. On one hand, different discourses were emphasized by believers from different churches. As this paper discusses, the Presbyterianhurch emphasizes a ""repentant heart"", while the True Jesus Church advocates the concept of ""the holy spirit"", and the Catholic church combines the concept of a ""Creator God"" with the local concept ""utux"". On the other hand, believers from different sects continued to comply with the norms of waya, combination of waya and heart, and ritual practices of utux beliefs. This paper indicates how the Sediq practices waya and lnlungan in daily life. It also is concerned with the unique religious experience of individuals during the process of Charismatic Movement, as well as the discourse of ""everyone's body is a church"". These discussions on ""religion in social practice"" and ""individuality"" should be conducive for rethinking the definition of ""religion"" that has been standard since Durkheim's time. The concepts should be helpful as well for understanding how the locals re-define their existence in different fields beyond the church -- by renewing their relationship with themselves, with others, or with the supernatural.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/89-1.pdf,89,2018,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

Forty-four glass artefacts from Jiuxianglan were analysed in this study, including beads and waste. The results indicate that there is not a complete match of the chemical composition and the microstructure between the finished beads and waste, therefore local production of beads analysed here is not supported by the evidence at this site and the finished glass beads may have been imported from the South China Sea region. Scientific analysis also revealed information on raw materials and the colouring process. While the red and orange glass beads are both coloured by cuprite, the source of the copper-containing raw materials appears to vary. The microstructure of orange and yellow glass beads from Jiuxianglan are also different from beads from other sites, suggesting different colouring raw materials or colouring processes.

Governing Natural Resources and Developing Indigenous Communities: A Post-Developmentalist and Post-Humanist Review,"Kuang-Chi Hung, Chun-Yi Ho","community-based natural resource management (CBNRM), indigenous people, political ecology, relational ontology, infrastructure","If we take a survey of the natural resources policies undertaken in Taiwan during the past decade, it is not difficult to see that the state, as the major owner of natural resources in Taiwan, has already moved away from a policy based on the principle of exclusion and begun highlighting the importance of decentralization, devolution, empowerment, and other concepts that international development organizations have been advocating since the 1980s. As a result, polices relating to community forestry, co-management, and traditional territories that underline the partnership between the state and communities dependent on natural resources have become mainstream, and an array of state agencies have been charged with ensuring that the aforementioned policies are practiced both nationally and locally. But can such community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) enable policymakers to achieve a balance between governing natural resources and developing indigenous communities? Considering current debates surrounding traditional territories, wildlife conservation, the dispossession and unsustainable use of indigenous people’s land, the answer is not as straightforward as developmentalists might expect. The goal of this essay is to review the post-developmentalist and post-humanist concepts and approaches that environmental anthropologists, political ecologists, and STS (science and technology studies) scholars have developed to deal with the relationship between governing natural resources and developing indigenous people’s community. First, we show how developmentalists’ reflections on CBNRM gave rise to the second generation of CBNRM, with focuses on the indigenous community’s self-determination, as well as the property rights and sovereignty being maintained by the community over natural resource management. Then, we show how such focuses bring the subject of CBNRM out of the disciplinary boundaries of development studies and institutional economics, calling for attention from both political ecologists and environmental anthropologists. Second, we develop three lines of arguments -- “more ecological,” “more political,” and “both ecological and political” -- to delineate the epistemological and ontological stances that buttress environmental anthropologists’ and political ecologists’ analyses of the CBNRM. With these stances set forth, we explain why more and more researchers adopt relational ontology to untangle the network that characterizes today’s CBNRM and move beyond such taken-for-granted dualisms as the natural vs. the social and the global vs. the local. Worthy of note is that although we end our review with such a relational concept as infrastructure, we do not think that it has been well formulated. Based upon our critical reading of relevant case studies, we argue that the concept of infrastructure still has the following problematic aspects worthy of further investigation: 1. insufficient theorization of temporality, 2. thin ethnography, and 3. naïve objectivism. In conclusion, we critically examine recent studies pertaining to Taiwan’s indigenous people’s CBNRM, traditional territories, and traditional ecological knowledge, arguing that the relational concepts discussed in this essay shall pave the way for the next generation’s research on CBNRM and related subjects.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/89-3.pdf,89,2018,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Developing “Savages’ Land,” Controlling “Savages,” and the Performance of Ethnicity of Taiwan’s Indigeneous People: A Case Study on the Middle and Upstream of Lanyang River",Kuang-chi Hung,"indigenous people, historical justice, transitional justice, colonialism, assemblage","This essay argues against the discourse which scholars and activists manufacture about indigenous land justice in order to reveal the courses through which the Japanese colonial government developed Taiwan’s savage land and in the meantime brought savages under their control. On the one hand, I argue that the current political discourse is not political enough. On the other hand, using the middle and upstream of Lanyang River as an example, this essay examines a great deal of known and recently unearthed archival materials, brining politics back into the subject of indigenous land justice. While scholars tend to essentialize the colonial government as if it were an omniscient and cunning predator, and meanwhile treat indigenous people as if they were a unified, homogeneous, clearly defined and bounded group of people, this essay adopts a poststructuralist and postcolonial view, inquiring: 1. how did the colonial government frame the access to and control of savages’ land according to and contingent on a classificatory system of the savages? 2. how did this system of classification become stabilized and consolidated as the savages’ land got entangled with global capitalism and underwent the course of state-making? 3. to what extent did this stabilized and consolidated system of classification give rise to concepts such as “ethnic group,” “tradition” and “culture” as seen in today’s discourses on indigenous historical justice and transitional justice? Also noteworthy is that the way in which this essay treats history differs from current literature. I don’t think that the history of how the colonial government established a system of government over the savages’ land can be considered progressive and lineal. To grasp the complexity, contingency, and fluidity of this history, I rely on a concept that has provoked wide discussion and debate in the fields of both human geography and anthropology: assemblage. I argue that the system of government which the Japanese colonial government imposed on savages’ land was by no means novel. After analyzing how the colonial government pulled together various elements to put the savages’ land in order, I show that the sources of those elements were remarkably diverse, ranging from the Qing empire’s experience in dealing with Taiwan’s savages, to some rather outdated European and American theories of sociology and anthropology, to fragmented pieces of information gathered during colonial officers’ interactions with savages. Because the system of government was a heterogeneous and contingent one, I suggest that scholars no longer deal with that system as if it were a compact and watertight one within which the colonized got helplessly entangled and suppressed. Only by adopting such the epistemological and methodological stances can we unearth, analyze, and appreciate the agency which emerges and is performed by the colonized subjects.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/90-1.pdf,90,2019,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

Using the site Saqacengalj as a case study, this research shows that the two datasets exhibit high consistency in analyses such as morphology, least-cost path, visibility, and social meshworks.

As a World Heritage Site since 2008, it brings various stakeholders together working on the preservation of cultural heritage with different strategies of value enhancement in their use of public symbolic spaces. Through observation of preservation actions related to the Armenian Street at the very heart of the heritage quarters, we show that the subjectivity in heritage imaginary is not limited to ethnic membership or statutory citizenship, but also includes other marginal subjects (e.g., tenants, children, secret societies) created through the actions of various rights claimants. The value of these actions is difficult to be clearly recognized, however, precisely because this subjectivity is in flux.

In this article, the concept of “fluid marginality” is adopted to understand various historical situations of the Clan Jetties, which also reflect importantly on the processes of Penang’s development. This fluid marginality which stemmed from their borderland conditions, along with rich sensory experiences, informs the daily lives and collective identities of residents. Since 2008, following the listing of George Town as a World Heritage Site, the Clan Jetties have come to be seen as mainly a tourist spot and gradually lost their close connections with the sea.

I try to demonstrate how the Late Neolithic Wansan people had been entangled with the Wansan hill by examining the environmental data, settlement layout, and material objects through time. The archaeological features, including modified terraces, postholes, burials, and possible storage features, all indicate human intention to modify the hill for their habitation. At the same time, these actions were possible by not only human intervention, but also various things acquired from the hill. Furthermore, the placement of deceased ancestors directly below the domestic spheres suggest the close interaction between the hill and people. The Wansan hill drew and tied people together, however, the nature and the location of the hill required human investing energy to maintain their environment. By investigating this human-thing, thing-thing, thing-human and human-human relationships, I argue that the entanglement between the hill and people through a thousand year made the hill vulnerable to human habitation. In the end, the Wansan people chose to leave their home a few hundred years before the dramatic climate change inferred from the environmental reconstruction.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/91-2.pdf,91,2019,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

The insights derived from the author’s long-term research on the Tung-pu Bunun people provide an alternative perspective to examine Maa-ling Chen’s archaeological studies at Saqacengalj, a ruined settlement site of southern Paiwan. Her objective of identifying the social structure with the configuration of settlement pattern was compromised by the deviation between archaeological evidences and ethnographic accounts. This is partly due to the untimely conceptual framework and the neglect of historical and geographical contexts. The author’s long-term research and some other researches done in recent years (works by Wen-te Chen, Kai-shyh Lin, etc.) show that the socio-historical processes and geographic location play major roles on the articulation of the relationship between settlement and household and population grouping / ethnogenesis. Nei-pen-lu, a ruined settlement site of Bunun people in southern Taiwan, was unique in the way local people were able to adapt and adopt socio-cultural mechanisms innovatively from their neighbours. As a result, Nei-pen-lu was transforming from an egalitarian to a stratified society. This unique case challenges current theories on the course of social stratification. An integrated study of archaeology and anthropology is required to answer the question.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/92-1.pdf,92,2020,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Ontologies of Food Taboos: The Evolving Pork and Carcass in the Scientification of Halal Authentication in Indonesia,En-chieh Chao,"the ontological turn, ritually prohibited things, scientification, halal authentication, Indonesia","In her masterpiece, Purity and Danger, Mary Douglas famously concludes that pork is prohibited and considered unclean because pigs do not fit the animal category of having cloven hooves and chewing the cud. Ritually prohibited things are unclean because they are outside of cultural classification. While maintaining its analytical value, this theory nonetheless treats a dietary code as a static and singular system, and hence is unable to aid much to reveal the ways in which forbidden things can change their modes of existence over time, and even exist with multiple ontologies. This essay tackles the question of multiple ontologies that pork and carcass entail in the scientification of halal authentication in Indonesia. In this changing socio-cultural process, what it means to be halal is a result of webs of interaction, in which multiple authorities, economic interests and animal corporeality negotiate to compete or collaborate. In this sense, a deeper understanding of ritually prohibited things involves an ontological investigation beyond the traditional epistemological question. Meanwhile, this article contributes to the debate of the ontological turn by arguing that ontological inquiries need to bring power relation and socio-historical construction back in, so that we can properly respond to the unresolved accusation that “ontology is just another word for culture, and ontology neglects realpolitik.”",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/92-3.pdf,92,2020,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"The Memory Turn in and the Cross-border Negotiation over the Making of Jewish Heritage in Shanghai: Cosmopolitan Memories, Heritage Diplomacy and Urban Spatial Politics","Shu-mei Huang, Hao-chun Chang","memory turn, memory of the world, Shanghai Jews, cosmopolitan memory, the Tilanqiao Historic Cultural Preservation District, Heritagization","The past two decades have witnessed a growing recognition of making holocaust memories a key in pursuing cosmopolitan memories in cases across borders. Existing literature considers the development of cosmonostalgia as related to the globalization of heritage. In light of this, we try to explore the establishment of the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Museum and attempt to register stories of the Shanghai Jews as UNESCO Memory of the World as a point of departure to trace the development of the Tilanqiao Historic Cultural Preservation District, Hongkou, during the past twenty years. In recent years, the Hongkou District Administration has been promoting Tilanqiao as “Shanghai Ark,” turning away from pursuing World Heritage towards Memory of the World and in so doing to re-articulate Hongkou as a modern cosmopolitan hub. Focusing on such an ongoing process of heritagization of Jewish heritage in Shanghai, this research tries to answer the following questions: How has the process of the heritagization of the Jewish heritage in Shanghai taken place and what is the drive for an initiative as such? How has heritage preservation as discursive practice been carried out to mediate the related cross-border negotiation, interdisciplinary competition, and challenges as a result? How has the process of the heritagization of the Jewish heritage in Shanghai left impacts on the everyday life of the Tilanqiao residents? Adopting content analysis of heritage planning documents, in-depth interview, and ethnographic investigation, this research illustrates the turn to Memory of the World over the past two decades. In conclusion, it presents the challenges of mobilizing cosmopolitan memories and moreover, the difficult situation in which local residents further alienate themselves from the politics over heritage for their aspiration for relocation by preservation.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/92-4.pdf,92,2020,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

However, recently researchers have countered this view. Through careful examination of the internal spaces and material sign system of New Chitose Airport in Hokkaido, Japan, I pose a series of arguments regarding the production of locality and the commercial representation of regional culture. The ethnographic and material analysis of this unique airport not only illustrates the technologies that produce the popular imagination of Hokkaido, but also sheds light on the ways in which this northern island is deeply enmeshed in the Japanese history of modernization. In so doing, this paper develops an anthropological study of contemporary Japanese culture by using a regional airport as a field site.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/93-1.pdf,93,2020,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Utilization of Subsistence Resources and the Development of Small-Scale Societies: Comparative Perspectives on the Maritime Hypothesis and Feasting / Consumption Behaviors,Peiyu Chen,"Maritime Hypothesis, subsistence activity, small-scale society, consumption and feasting, early Andean coastal sites","Small-scale societies, characterized by lacking institutionalized hierarchy and as groups of limited population, are prevalent across time and space throughout human history. Archaeologists have always been interested in the developmental trajectories of these societies and their pathways to complexity. Taking the cases from the early Andean Coast, this article focuses on the possible relationship between subsistence utilization and societal development. By summarizing and interpreting data from Huaca Negra, Cerro Lampay, and Gramalote, this article conducts both diachronic comparison of one site (Huaca Negra) and synchronic comparison among different sites. The results offer new perspectives to the critical idea of Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization and to the discussion of feasting as a possible power strategy. This work not only illustrates the diverse developmental trajectories of small-scale societies within the Andean context but also encourages more input of comparative cases across regions. A comparative perspective would depict a clearer picture of the interaction between subsistence activities and early societies.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/93-2.pdf,93,2020,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology

The Formation Process of Archaeological Stratigraphy during the Abandonment of the South Gate Wall of Old Fongshan County,Kuo-feng Chung,"archaeological stratigraphy, Harris Matrix, Old Fongshan County, formation process","With the idea of ethnostratigraphic unit, Stein (J. Stein) urged archaeologists to free themselves from the concept of geological sedimentary strata when looking at archaeological stratigraphy created by human action and to pay attention to the cultural and natural transformations during site formation processes. Rich in cultural significance, the archaeological stratigraphy is not always directly subject to the laws of natural deposition. Instead, it more strongly reflects the diverse forces and impact on the ground of human occupations. To document the complex archaeological stratigraphy, the Harris Matrix system is considered particularly desirable and applicable. The excavation of Old Fongshan County Historical Site applied open area excavation strategy, natural layer excavation methods, and the Harris Matrix. This research attempts to unravel a series of depositional events of strata accumulation, superposition, removal of deposits, and land filling that resulted from the construction, use, abandonment and destruction of the Ching Dynastic city walls. In doing so, we reconstruct the stratigraphic sequence of the south gate wall of Old Fongshan County. It is concluded that the Harris Matrix can serve as an extremely useful aid in recognizing distinct deposit units on site and in making systematic correlations of the recording of these units, thereby enriching the meanings and contextual interpretations of the processes by which archaeological stratigraphy is formed.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/93-4.pdf,93,2020,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Reconstructing Prehistoric Lapita Social Networks through Source Analysis: A Case Study from New Caledonia Lapita Sites,"Scarlett Chiu, Yuyin Su","Lapita pottery analysis, chemical compositional analysis, petrographic analysis, patterns of prehistoric migrations","This article summarizes the results of a wide range of analyses on pottery assemblages from New Caledonia, including both petrographic analysis and chemical composition analysis. This study illustrates how such techniques can be employed to review past hypotheses about the migration patterns of prehistoric Oceania, and how such studies can supplement and improve our current understanding of the social relationships between the populations involved. Despite populations settling in the Loyalty Islands early on, our current results indicate that pottery made from this area was not transferred to Grande Terre of New Caledonia, or to the Île des Pins located to the south. Lapita communities located at Vatcha on the Île des Pins acquired most of their pottery from the Diahot River valley located at the northwestern part of Grande Terre some 400 kilometers away, yet pottery made from this region rarely appears in the Lapita sites of the Loyalty Islands. The Goro community located at the southern end of Grande Terre received most of their pots from various areas located along the north coast, from the northwest to the northeast, yet like communities in the Loyalties, they rarely received any pots from the Diahot River valley. This distribution pattern allows us to put forward new perspectives on the complexity of the local pottery exchange patterns. This article also details difficulties that were encountered when using different analytical methods, and proposes solutions to overcome some of these issues.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/94-1.pdf,94,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
"Plant Utilization and Rice Cultivation Based on Phytolith Analysis of the Peinan Site, Eastern Taiwan",Yun-ning Kang,"Peinan Site, rice cultivation, plant utilization, phytolith analysis, agricultural archaeology","The Peinan Site is the representative site of the Peinan Culture of the late Neolithic Age in eastern Taiwan. Based on the geographical environment and climatic characteristics, the Peinan Site has high temperatures and low rainfall, and is suitable for the growth of dry-farming crops. In terms of archaeological remains, a large number of stone tools for agricultural harvesting have been unearthed, but actual plant remains have been elusive in the site’s archaeological research. This research attempts to apply phytolith analysis to identify the relevant clues of plant remains at the Peinan Site, and further analyzes temporal changes and the spatial distribution of the same period to enhance our understanding of the plant utilization and agricultural development of the Peinan Cultural people. Based on the results of the phytolith analysis of ceramic and soil samples, rice was part of the prehistoric peoples’ daily lives from the early period of the Peinan Culture. It disappeared after the end of the Peinan Culture, and its distribution is related to the settlement layout. In addition, the Oryza phytoliths in the Peinan Site are judged to be of the indica type through subspecies analysis. Identification of the subspecies of prehistoric rice may be used as an opportunity to deepen research on Taiwan's agricultural prehistory and related issues such as population and material transmission routes.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/94-2.pdf,94,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
From South Asia to France: The Transnational (Re)migration of Tibetan Refugees,Yu-shan Liu,"Tibetan refugees, transnational migration, asylum, France, South Asia","This article focuses on the migration flows of Tibetan refugees from South Asia, where they or their parents first settled after fleeing Tibet, to France, in the past two decades. Based on the fieldwork carried out in both France and India between 2016 and 2019, this study casts light on the daily lives of Tibetans living in France and their involvement in transnational practices across national boundaries. It explores how the Tibetan refugees engage with an increasingly fragmented and mobile world of diaspora, and how they negotiate their identities (being stateless and being Tibetan) with different “others.” Focusing on the Tibetan newcomers in France, this study observes the dynamics enacted in the relationships between Tibetans of different origins. It also explores the ambiguities that are played out and reflected in assertions about being “Tibetan refugees.” The findings suggest that the recent migratory flows of young people have become an important trend, bringing social and cultural changes from within and outside diasporic Tibetan communities, and thereby renegotiating the boundaries of “being Tibetan” and “being refugees.” Overall, this article provides a significant and insightful ethnography of the Tibetan diaspora today, and rethinks the anthropological methodology for dealing with people “on the move.”",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/94-3.pdf,94,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Bonsai-scape in an Industrial Crevice Space: On the Possibilities of Co-dwelling and Correspondence of Humans and Trees in a Disturbed Environment,Hsin-yi Lu,"bonsai, correspondence, human-plant relationship, urban ethnography","The juxtaposition of rustic industrial facilities and lush potted trees in Houjin community creates an intriguing bonsai-scape in the space adjacent to the former Kaohsiung oil refinery. This paper examines the life world in Houjin’s bonsai garden from the “dwelling perspective,” conceptualized by Tim Ingold, and analyzes how people and trees can live and grow together in an environment severely disturbed by industrial activities. ""Correspondence"" is the key concept adopted in this paper to explicate the affinities between humans and trees, as well as the coexistence of bonsais and the industrial environment in which they reside. I draw three conclusions from the field study: First, bonsai can be viewed as a cocreation by the bonsai grower and the tree because its long cultivation process involves a combination of human actions such as pruning and shaping, as well as the tree’s tactile responses through bark, branches and leaves. Second, the intensive watering and pruning required to meet the trees’ biological needs, as well as the trees’ fixation with the ground, have structured the regular work pattern in the garden and created a dwelling place that corresponds to the daily needs of the tree. The visible state of the garden plants has replaced words as concrete clues that correspond to the life conditions of the bonsai growers. Third, I investigate the reason why bonsai agriculture was able to emerge in this area and how the appearance of the bonsai garden corresponds to the formation of the industrial city. The people, the trees and the community have co-constructed a vibrant world with their lives resonating in this crevice amidst industrial facilities.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E5%AD%B8%E5%88%8A_95-1_%E5%B7%A5%E6%A5%AD%E9%9A%99%E7%B8%AB%E8%A3%A1%E7%9A%84%E7%9B%86%E6%A0%BD%E6%99%AF%E8%A7%80%EF%BC%9A%E4%BA%BA%E8%88%87%E6%A8%B9%E5%9C%A8%E5%A4%B1%E8%AA%BF%E7%92%B0%E5%A2%83%E4%B8%AD%E7%9A%84%E7%AC%A6%E6%87%89%E8%88%87%E5%85%B1%E7%94%9F.pdf,95,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
“Eagles Are Back!”: From City of Science to Organic Republic,Ya-chung Chuang,"Ontology, multiple worlds, the urban, eco-friendly farming, Hsinchu","I among many watchers spot eagles more often in the skies close to the Hsinchu metropole. My gardening teacher Abole attributes it to the emerging eco-friendly farming in the area. According to the official statistics, the lands for certified organic agriculture comprise only 1% of the farmlands nationwide. Even including those lands where self-help natural farming is practiced, the unconventional farmlands would not exceed 2% of the total farmlands. This paper investigates why under the heavy environmental pressure due to the intensive industrialization and urbanization in the area, this 2% alternative farming is able to make an enormous difference. Why have the eagles returned to the urban skies? This paper examines an alternative worlding that have helped to bring the eagles back. I call the world evolving from this worlding process “the Organic Republic.” The Hsinchu Science Metropole has been in the making since the Hsinchu Science Park was created in 1980. There has been an urban sprawl since the early 1990s when a large-scale urban expansion and renewal plan was proposed. However, we also find that many environmentalist and eco-conscious discourses, actions and networkings have come into existence. This paper contends that an ontological reflection on the concepts such as city and nature can lead us to explore diverse actors and their relations across this alternate worlding process.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E5%AD%B8%E5%88%8A_95-2_%E3%80%8C%E8%80%81%E9%B7%B9%E5%9B%9E%E4%BE%86%E4%BA%86%E3%80%8D%EF%BC%9A%E5%BE%9E%E6%96%B0%E7%AB%B9%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%B8%E5%9F%8E%E5%88%B0%E6%9C%89%E6%A9%9F%E5%85%B1%E5%92%8C%E5%9C%8B.pdf,95,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Sun-dried Salt as Best Supporting Actor: Marketing and Innovation of Taiwanese Industrial Heritage,Eric Siu-kei Cheng,"salt, industrial cultural heritage, sensory marketing, gastronomy, non-human actant","In 2002, the Taiwan Salt Works discontinued its Taiwan salt field operations. This decision represented the end of Taiwanese salt production. However, Taiwanese sun-dried salt re-entered the market thanks to heritage conservation practitioners’ efforts of salt field re-operation, heritage management, environmental education, and marketing. Adopting the analytical frameworks of the social life of things and posthumanism, this paper explores the practitioners’ recategorization of salt products and their extension of social networks. This ethnography first describes the heritagitization and wetlandization of former salt fields located along coastal southwestern Taiwan. I explain how the decline of salt industry, the rise of the Taiwanese environmental movement, and cultural heritage preservation have led to a new salt-field-wetland landscape. This formation has affected human-nature interactions. Next, I use the case study of Zhou Nan Salt Field in Budai Township, Chiayi County, to examine how its practitioners tackle different issues of salt industrial heritage conservation. I also investigate how and why they re-categorize salt. After that, this paper analyzes the experiences of the practitioners’ interactions with algae and their perception categories of salt tasting to market their salt products. I also discuss how these people explore the market and attract customers by shaping the supporting role of salt in terms of gastronomy and its associated network.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E5%AD%B8%E5%88%8A_95-3_%E6%88%90%E7%82%BA%E6%9C%80%E4%BD%B3%E9%85%8D%E8%A7%92%EF%BC%9A%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E6%97%A5%E6%99%92%E9%B9%BD%E7%9A%84%E5%95%86%E5%93%81%E5%8C%96%E3%80%81%E9%9D%9E%E4%BA%BA%E8%A1%8C%E5%8B%95%E8%80%85%E8%88%87%E7%BE%8E%E9%A3%9F%E7%B6%B2%E7%B5%A1.pdf,95,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Letting the Spirits Rest: Reconciling Indonesia’s Past through Unseen Realms,Kar-yen Leong,"History, Indonesia, Human Rights, Memory, 1965, ghosts","The presentation and historical interpretation of the events of post-Sukarno 1965 are often shrouded in fear and silence. Despite the efforts of NGOs, human rights groups and academics, attempts at reinterpretation or revising Indonesia’s past have often met with fierce opposition. Groups which are religiously- or militarilyaffiliated often brand any such attempt at revising the history of 1965 as being a conspiracy to raise the flag of communism on Indonesia’s soil. Fringe groups such as the Front Pembela Islam (Islamic Defenders Front) and the Front Anti Komunis Indonesia (Anti-Communist Front) have been at the forefront of violently disruptive actions against exhibitions, movie screenings, or even discussions about that specific period. These groups often brand revisionist retellings of 1965 as arising from an ethereal bahaya laten (latent danger) or komunisme gaya baru (new-style communism). This discourse bears an uncanny resemblance to the Orde Baru (New Order) regime’s paranoiac fears of organisasi tanpa bentuk (formless organisations) subverting the state from within. Using opaque language and taking advantage of a “ghostly lexicon” that have already existed within Indonesia, the New Order regime was able to create an atmosphere of fear and foreboding. Nonetheless, despite the overthrow of Suharto’s New Order regime, Indonesia continues to live amongst the shadows and phantasms which have yet to be exorcised even after nearly 20 years of democratic transition. This paper investigates the ghostly phenomena arising from the taboo-like nature of the events of 1965. I will specifically look at how spaces of past violence have been transformed into informal memorials testifying to Indonesia’s “silenced past.” I will also be investigating rumors and ghost stories hypothesizing that these elements represent a way in which the past expresses itself even as fringe factions and groups continue to maintain an “enforced silence” on the events of 1965. Through the investigation of these events and by presenting them as symbolic tropes, we can gain a deeper understanding of how nations and societies reconcile with their pasts in transitional contexts.",http://homepage.ntu.edu.tw/~anthro/download/journal/%E8%80%83%E5%8F%A4%E4%BA%BA%E9%A1%9E%E5%AD%B8%E5%88%8A_95-4_Letting-the-Spirits-Rest-Reconciling-Indonesias-Past-through-unseen-Realms.pdf,95,2021,Journal of Archaeology and Anthropology
Art Festivals in Folk Worlds: A Discussion Centering on the Asia Madang Arts Festival and Zhao Chuan's Grass Stage,Hsu Jen-hao Walter,"Zhao Chuan, People's Theatre, 38th Parallel Still Play, Asia Madang Arts Festival, Grass Stage","Taking Ric Knowles's discussions of contemporary arts festivals as a point of departure, this article attempts to explore the political and historical significance of the Asia Madang Arts Festival held in Gwangju, South Korea in 2005, a time of high globalization. This study seeks to theorize Grass Stage, a Chinese nongovernmental and nonprofit theatre troupe from Shanghai born out of this festival, as a continuation and transformation of its folk spirit. First, this article discusses the changing relationships between the Asia Madang Arts Festival and Asia People's Theatre Network, illuminating the aesthetic strategies they adopt to confront the historical specter of the Cold War and critically engage with pressing contemporary political issues. Then, using a focused discussion of 38th Parallel Still Play, Grass Stage's pioneering performance, this article reveals how the radical qualities of Asia Madang have determined and influenced Grass Stage's theatrics. This study further suggests that, despite the fact that Asia Madang only happened once, it has succeeded in opening up a heterotopia in globalized time-space, allowing Grass Stage to critically engage with radical political issues in contemporary Shanghai. Based on the ensuing development of Grass Stage, how can we renew our conceptualizations of left- and right-wing politics in contemporary China? How can we maintain subversive folk spirit in today's historical condition? The above-mentioned discussions suggest that it is futile to demarcate the domain of People's Theatre in today's Asia. In a world already permeated by flows of capital, how can we relocate the positioning of politicized people? Maybe the key is managing to open up a nonprofit time-space for multitudes from different parts of the world to come together, collide with each other, or even argue with each other. It is between differences and divergences that we seek to reveal the sources of oppression and their relationship with unresolved historical and political issues.

In light of postdramatic theatre, artistic activism, and the concepts of dérive and psychogeography proposed by Situationist International, this research analyzes MELLEMRUM Tainan, not as an autonomous artwork with predetermined meanings but as an immediate communications process between performers, urban space, and audience. Due to the absence of fictional narratives in MELLEMRUM Tainan, the audience could not seek its comfort zone of familiar spectatorship in dramatic theatre but had to look for new ways of perception during the performance. Deviating from the earlier genre of environmental theatre as urban spectacle predominant in City Stage Tainan Arts Festival, the performative act of implanting MELLEMRUM Tainan during the 2019 Tainan Arts Festival represents an infiltration as well as an intervention that negotiates cultural governance and politics of space under the political economy of global capitalism. As suggested by David Harvey's analysis of monopoly rent, the inherent tension in this performative act is key to creating spaces of hope where art could be an effective agent leading to deviation from the set course of global capitalism, which shows how MELLEMRUM Tainan could be both illuminating and inspiring.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-N202301120011-00003,218,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Due to the development of the professional divisions of labor in modern theatre, Traditional Taiwanese Opera is closely related to the ""national symbol."" The intellectual elite, motivated by the ideology of nationalism, has carefully crafted the original works of the opera, which makes the meaning of canonization evident. It is significantly related to the process of planning (curation), review, and evaluation mechanism of the production of works, which not only directly affects the ""canonization"" of Traditional Taiwanese Opera but also forms a group of a distinctive class of audience, so-called experts and scholars whom the cultural bureaucrats mostly put their trust in and reliance on. In the field of Traditional Taiwanese Opera in the modern theatre (cultural field), a rather exclusive nature is created due to the specific habitus and different demands from the taste of ordinary people. Such a system of cultural production may dissolve the problems or dissipate the tension that undermines artistic autonomy because of the influence of capital power. Moreover, it has grown into a supreme artistic taste so that it could possibly blur the class differences between the traditional outdoor opera troupes and those related professionals in the cultural field (modern theatre). This article attempts to study the above-mentioned art festivals and analyze the development of their evaluation system for subsidization. Furthermore, based on the review mechanism and mobilization of resources allocated by the art festivals, I will try to demonstrate the significance and substance of the so-called contemporary Traditional Taiwanese Opera and its ecological impact.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-N202301120011-00004,218,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Shifts in the Attractiveness of Jiajiang Confronting Firecrackers: A Case Study of the Chiayi Zhenyou Troupe,Liou You-cheng,"firecrackers, performers' awareness, Guogouzi Zhen'an Temple, jiajiang","Jiajiang confronting firecrackers is an event where one member of the jiajiang troupe stands near piles of firecrackers and confronts the fusillade of explosions without fear, behavior currently considered as demonstrating the mighty power of the jiajiang. This article takes the Chiayi Guogouzi Zhen'an Temple Zhenyou Troupe as a case study of this phenomenon. By recording the experiences of senior members and related historical accounts, as well as scholarly research discussing changes in the performers' consciousness during these events, the author attempts to explain how changes in external conditions may be factors shaping the development of jiajiang confronting firecrackers performances, regardless of whether these changes impact individual performers, the entire troupe, or even the audience. Before discussing actual performances, this article first summarizes the history of the Zhenyou Troupe, especially the links between jiajiang performances and the rhythm of small brass gongs played by jiajiang troupes in Chiayi City. In particular, when facing many firecrackers, performers will strive even harder to display potent images of the jiajiang. Next, through discussion of performers' awareness, this study considers how they enter into unusual states of mind as an ideal state, while also discussing the reasons why fewer performers now appear in such a condition. Based on this article's analysis, the author hopes to explain that while jiajiang confronting firecrackers performances have attracted increasing attention, people's appreciation of their meaning can feature very different tastes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-N202301120011-00006,218,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Between Warp and Woof: The Invention of Ethnic Costume of Ulay Atayal,Chiang Kuei-chen,"invented tradition, ethnic group boundary, ethnic costume, Ulay Atayal, revival","The native Atayal people of Ulay, New Taipei City, encountered Han culture at an early stage. In addition, the impact of commercial tourism caused serious loss of traditional culture. Their heritage of weaving discontinued as a result. In recent years, however, heightened ethnic awareness engenders an ethnic cultural revival, particularly in that of ethnic clothing. The Ulay Atayal people has offered courses in traditional weaving, organized visits to the Artifacts Exhibition Room in NTU Museum of Anthropology, launched ＂Ulay Weaving Workshops＂ and set up ＂Ulay Weaving Association.＂ The Ulay weavers learn how to operate a traditional loom, rediscover traditional woven patterns of the Kusshaku (Quchi) Atayal and re-present its weaving art. Furthermore, they designed and woven their exclusive ＂ethnic costume＂ to participate in the Weaving Festival of Ulay Atayal 2020. The study of costume involves various dimensions, ranging from its techniques, social structure, ideology, and identity. Clothing is both a physical representation of material culture, and also an abstract code for communication. Throughout history, people define themselves, reveal their identity, and convey collective ethnic values with the production and reproduction of clothing. However, cultural dynamics coincides with both human agency and multi-layered identities. Cultural patterns are not confined within the normal concept of ＂traditional clothing.＂ In this changing time and space, different cultures encounter, interact, negotiate, and compromise with each other. As a means to identify oneself and formulate senses of identity, elements of clothing will be changed, appropriated, and reformulated. In this paper, I analyze the production of ＂ethnic costume＂ of Ulay Atayal, its origin and motivation, how the weaver envisions and conceptualizes ＂ethnic costume,＂ the significance of ethnic costume in terms of ethnic identity, construction, fluidity and merging of ethnic boundaries. I also examine the revival of weaving arts, the discourse power of weaving women, and the symbolic meanings and collective values embodied in ethnic costume. Finally, I illustrate how the production of these contemporary ＂ethnic costume＂ is connected to the invention of Ulay Atayal clothing culture and their historical imagination.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202209-202209300010-202209300010-27-65,217,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Evolution and Personhood of Embroidered Deity's Clothing in Taiwan,Wang Ching-yi,"embroidery, personhood, deity's clothing, religious folk customs, traditional crafts","This paper investigates the evolution in the production and representation of deity's clothing in Taiwan. It is an attempt to understand the concept of personhood between human-god interactions. Religious sacrificial rites are popular in Taiwan, and the devotees' reverence is reflected in the clothing they dedicated to the deities. The process of producing deities' clothing involves both visible and intangible sympathetic interaction among gods, devotees, and craftsmen. The production of deities' clothing demonstrates the devotees' reverence, while also implying popular imagination and projection. By means of literature analysis and field investigation, I conduct interviews with four embroidery artists who are still active and well-known in the business. I analyze their production, cultural characteristics, tradition, and innovation, to describe the driving force and personhood of deities' clothing in the creation. The finished product is a result of communication between the artist and the customer. Besides market demand, the artist's folk knowledge, cultural literacy, and embroidery craftsmanship are fundamental in the heritage and development of deities' clothing. From the perspective of traditional beliefs, deity's clothing is a symbol of folk culture, whereas from the perspective of modern thinking, it retains additional psychological connotations. In the contemporary era of heightened cultural creativity and self-awareness, the trend in the cultural and creative industry has shifted from one that is focused on traditional, religious, and cultural heritage to one that is customized and market-oriented.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202209-202209300010-202209300010-67-104,217,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

It describes the production process of ramie fiber, the weaving tools, methods, and weaving patterns in an attempt to present the contemporary revival of Paiwan weaving, and to explore its contemporary significance. Fieldwork was conducted to discern the weaver's life experience and transcribe her oral knowledge to apprehend the cultural connotations of weaving. The main informant is Ms. Hsu Chun-mei (Ljumiyang in Paiwanese), a weaver from the Kuljaljau village. Hsu Chun-mei's knowledge of weaving techniques largely relies on her father's childhood memory of watching his mother and grandmother weaving. Through gradual fumbling, she re-discovers the traditional culture that Paiwan women are proud of. This paper also records the long-discontinued Piyuma weaving ritual re-enacted in 2020. It documents the ritual process and ritual language in detail, and discusses the meaning of Paiwan plain weaving pattern.

Ascending the Altar to Chant the Scriptures: The Formation and Development of Daoist Scripture Reaction Rituals,Chang Chao-jan,"ritual, Daoism, fasting and offering liturgies (zhaijiao 齋醮), scripture recitation","Scriptures-chanting is an important and major component of Daoist ritual. The essential Daoist fasting ritual (zhai 齋), is composed of two main segments at its inception, i.e., ＂enacting the Dao＂ (xing Dao 行道) and ＂chanting scriptures＂ (zhuanjing 轉經). To this day, scripture recitation is still an indispensable part of Daoist fasting and offering liturgies (zhaijiao keyi 齋醮科儀). However, scripture recitation is not part of the early Daoist practice, nor is it commonly seen across Daoist scriptures. How exactly does this rite eventually develop into an essential practice found in major scriptures? This article studies scripture recitation rites held during the fasting and offering liturgies and undertakes a preliminary investigation of their content, characteristics, and their changes and developments. The investigation focuses specifically on the following three aspects, 1) the formulation and content of Pre-Tang recitation rite, when it was first paired with the rite of ＂enacting the Dao＂; 2) the late Tang scripture recitation rite arranged and standardized by Du Guangting 杜光庭and the specific content of the Southern Song rite, ＂ritual for ascending to the altar to chant the scriptures＂ (shengtan zhuanjing yi 陞壇轉經儀), which is considered a continuation of this earlier tradition; 3) the development and changes of scripture recitation rituals after the Yuan and Ming dynasties.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202209-202209300010-202209300010-161-200,217,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

To understand the localization and characteristics of modern Xiantiandao, emphasis will be placed on the Nam Nha Temple in Cần Thơ. The main reason for the huge success of Minh Sư Đạo is that Zhang Daoxin and Wu Jinquan converted the Vietnamese Nguyễn Giác Nguyên. Nguyễn Giác Nguyên established Nam Nha Temple and Mai Kim Lan donated lands to expand the territory of Nam Nha Temple while Đinh Đạo Ninh preached from south to north of Vietnam. Their efforts helped Minh to become localized and successfully disseminate throughout Vietnam. Since the French occupation of Vietnam in 1885, Nguyễn Giác Nguyên, Đinh Văn Chương and a great number of the devotees of Minh Sư Đạo had participated in rebellions against the French to restore the Vietnamese government.

These rGyalrong noble families are all of the native official rank of tusi (native chieftain) or tushoubei (native commander). Historian Wang Mingke has proposed that northwest Sichuan went through a process of ＂Tibetanization＂ before its ＂Sinicization.＂ In this study, I intend to explore the regional historical characteristics Wang raised by comparing details of the clothing. I will also discuss how clothing is related to theory of ethnic boundary. Drawing examples from the three families, the Wasi native chieftains, the Zagunao native commanders and the Zhuokeji native chieftains, I discuss how they use their clothing to embody their cultural value, and how they employ different levels of style-changing in clothing and different style-mixing to illustrate the area's complex history.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202206-202207050009-202207050009-27-88,216,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Symbolic Metaphor and Interpretation of Costume Design in Sunlight after Snowfall,"Wang Yi-meei, Sung Tung-jung","Peking opera, semiotic analysis, costume design, Sunlight after Snowfall, digital technology","The costume style and color details on the stage are important components of visual images, as well as symbols of the codified clothing. The color image of Peking opera costume explicitly reveals a role's social status, theatrical effect, and the vertical and horizontal relationship between the roles. In 2017, GuoGuang Opera Company presented a contemporary Peking opera Sunlight after Snowfall which was inspired by Wang Xizhi's calligraphy ＂Timely Clearing After Snowfall.＂ The production combined different forms of expression, such as Peking opera, symphony orchestra and opera. It also included elements of digital technology to show the innovative energy of contemporary opera aesthetics. Clothing is a symbol of culture, while costume provides important clues for characters and storylines. Based on Roland Barthes' semiotics theory, this paper analyzes the symbolic performance and implicit meaning of Sunlight after Snowfall costume design. It also illustrates how digital costume design uses styles and colors to shape the character's personality, conveys the role's secondary meanings, such as inherent morality and conceptual value, and provides a computer-aided costume design case analysis as another perspective to understand the aesthetics of theater design.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202206-202207050009-202207050009-89-108,216,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Application and Uniqueness: Embroidered Roundels with Theatrical Figures in Late Qing Garments,Kuo Chao-yin,"Chinese opera figures, late Qing women's clothing, Chinese opera roundels","The purpose of this article is to analyze a piece of garment, ＂Blue Satin Jacket with Embroidered Roundels of Theatrical Figures,＂ held in the collection of Chinese Textiles and Clothing Culture Center. I first describe the pictorial composition of the roundels, then demonstrate how each of the ten roundels on the garment depicts a theatrical scene. The jacket features the following scenes ＂A Surprising Dream＂ from The Peony Pavilion, ＂Endowing the Tower＂ from The Pearl Tower, ＂Tossing a Spear＂ from Series of Stratagems, and other highlights from love stories in Chinese opera. Through the arrangement and combination of different scenes from Chinese opera, the wearer created a unique narrative that details the story of a woman falling in love of her own free will, marrying and having children, and taking care of her parents-in-law. I use the narrative roundels on the jacket as a basis to discuss how these Chinese opera figures are applied and depicted in Qing illustrations, ceramics, and New Year woodblock prints. Intertextual analysis is used to demonstrate the similarities and differences between various types of media, as well as how the popular opera culture has impacted the presentation of such figures on different visual mediums.

Professional Malaysian Gezaixi Troupes' Management Strategy and Genre Formulation in Times of Trouble: From Xin Kî-lîn to Sió Kî-lîn,Lin Ho-yi,"Sió Kî-lîn, Xiao Jinzhi, Xin Kî-lîn, gezaixi opera, Liu Huchen","In the 1960s, due to the rise of new entertainments in Singapore and Malaysia, commercial performances of Chinese opera suffered a rapid decline. In the 1980s, with strong economic growth and social transformation in Malaysia, many genres of theater disappeared one after another. Only gezaixi opera managed to pull through. With its highly flexible ＂scenario drama＂ mechanism and the hotbed of temple fair performances, a number of local professional troupes persevered. A few troupes employed unique management strategies under stringent circumstances and succeeded in opening up new venues of Chinese temple fair theater. Sió Kî-lîn is one of the notable exemples. It has been administered by the famous playwright/director Liu Huchen and his wife, the famous leading male role Xiao Jinzhi. Its predecessor is the Xin Kî-lîn Fujian theater troupe of Singapore, which migrated to Malaysia in the mid-1960s. The gist of Xin Kî-lîn's theatrical art, its business practices and corporation layout in its prime laid a solid foundation for its expansion in Malaysia and its distinctive performing style. In the late 1980s, Xin Kî-lîn changed its name to Sió Kî-lîn. Subsequently it returned to Singapore in 1991 and became a theatrical troupe with licenses registered in both countries. Liu Huchen and his wife excelled in repertoire innovation and performance. The key to their success lies in their adaptability to changing times and their ＂three bases, three theater trunks＂ operation mode that turns their weakness into strength. Sió Kî-lîn's tour itinerary of the late last century outlined a most representative Chinese cultural map. While they launch appealing plays with successfully management strategy, they also imbue new significance into this highly ＂inclusive＂ and ＂incidental＂ theater genre of gezaixi.

An Inquiry into the Records of Ningbo Kunqu Troupes' Performances in Shanghai Newspapers (1898-1915),Chiang Yu-chuan,"Shanghai tabloid, Ningbo Kunqu Troupes, Kunqu","The Ningbo Kunqu Troupes had made several tours to Shanghai theaters during the Guangxu reign and early Repubican years. Their influence on the tranmission of Kunqu is significant. However, regarding their performance dates, locations, repertoires and audience responses, very little is known for certain. Extant documentation mostly came from audience's accounts and interviews with senior artists. They are often inaccurate. Fortunately, articles and theater advertisements from Late Qing entertainment tabloids help supply some missing information. I have combed through the ＂Late Qing and Republican-Era Chinese Newspapers Database (1833-1911)＂ as well as Shen Bao newspaper database for relevant entries. The search yields tracks of the Ningbo Kunqu Troupes' tours to Shanghai. Apparently, there had been 8 tours from 1899 to 1915, in which individual troupes collaborated by joining their casts. Famous actors, such as Xu Yunbiao appeared in a number of these productions. The Ningbo Kunqu Troupes' performances in Shanghai concluded at Xinkaining Theater in 1915. Critical reviews of these productions did not appear in newspapers until 20 years later. The Ningbo Kunqu Troupes in contemporary Shanghai literati's reminiscence are actually Kunqu Troupes that had assimilated Yiyang style (also called Kunyi opera). For some sophisticated opera fans in Shanghai who were accustomed to genuine Suzhou dialect, the Ningbo actors' heavy accent sounded funny. Nevertheless, the audience continued to favor the performances.

The Hagiography Production of Xiang Yu's Cult in Wuxing and the Interaction between State and Local Society in the Southern Dynasties,Ho Wei-kang,"the Southern Dynasties, Xiang Yu, hagiography (miracles texts), Buddhism, Wuxing","The cult of Xiang Yu in the Wuxing area during the Southern Dynasties illustrates that Xiang Yu was both a local deity and a god of war. Its circumstances and development resemble that of the Jiang Ziwen in the Jiankang area. However, the strong ＂local＂ nature of Xiang Yu's cult strikes a stark contrast with the ＂state＂ character of Jiang Ziwen's cult. Hagiography of Xiang Yu in the Eastern Jin and Song dynasties mainly recounts certain magistrates' encounters with evil spirits or their untimely deaths. Legends of intermittent local magistrates' deaths suggest a reminiscence of the military violence which resulted from the uprisings and subsequent brutal suppressions. The hagiography of this period highlights the conflicts between intruders and the deity of Xiang Yu. After Qi and Liang dynasties, the arena between Wuxing and Jiankang shifted from military to religion. The deity Xiang Yu metamorphosed from an evil-causing spirit to one who received vegetarian offerings. Meanwhile, numerous constructions of Buddhist temples in the Wuxing area indicates that contention between local cults, the state, and Buddhism had reached a compromise. Regarding the production of hagiography, certain plots of Xiang Yu's legend are highly repetitive. The natives of Wuxing intimidated nonnative magistrates with the legend, while the state revised the plot to rein in local power. Different stance determines different impact on the development of the hagiography.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202203-202204010015-202204010015-1-42,215,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

This article first examines the term of the erxing ren, briefly reviews the relevant discourse before the Ming dynasty, discusses the interpretation and classification in Ming and Qing texts, and describes the two types: ＂being female with a man, and being male with a woman＂ and ＂half-moon is male, half-moon is female,＂ and further shows the sexual predicament brought about by their special physical state, the imagination of their sexual morality and sexual ability, as well as their adultery and sexual crimes. Finally, this article focuses on the issue of religion, the possibility and the consequences of becoming a nun, and the adultery under the guise of the identity of a nun.

Dynamically Constructing and Destroying the Perception of Sounds and Images in the Process of Departing: The Case Study of the Intermediate-State Ritual of Nona Hwatsang Center,Liou Yanfang,"localization, intermediate state, ritual sounds and images, Tibetan Buddhism, perception","After Buddhism was transmitted to Tibet, it became localized and absorbed various religious and cultural elements. Subsequently, when Tibetan Buddhism was transmitted to different countries and regions, it again became fused with local customs and beliefs, to form diverse types of Tibetan Buddhism. The object of this research is the Intermediate-state ritual regularly held for the deceased at Nona Hwatsang Center which belongs to the rNying ma lineage, which combines Chinese Buddhist doctrines with Tibetan Buddhist methods, and incorporates the form of religious activity of Han people. Past research on the Chanting-Service Ritual focuses on discussing religious thought and hospice care. This paper discusses how the perception is dynamically constructed and destroyed during the intermediate state by ＂incurving＂ the three-time sound and images in the ritual. The distinctive part of the Intermediate-state ritual is the gurus with high authority performing religious functions through playing the dead gurus' videos. The videos are used to imitate and present the sounds and images so that they might be heard and seen during the intermediate state, as instructed by the authoritative scriptures. In addition, the lay group guides the deceased's consciousness to dynamically perceive the sounds and images from the perspective of the Threefold Contemplation for self-liberating. Furthermore, in this research, Gilles Deleuze's theoretical structure of images is adopted to discuss the individual perceptions constructed dynamically through the interaction among various elements and karma during an individual's life. However, the deceased should realize the common perception of Buddha nature, which is constructed in Buddhist doctrines and has the effect of destroying the individual perceptions, and the mind's journey to the Pure Land.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202203-202204010015-202204010015-85-127,215,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Institutions such as ＂Arbeitsgemein-schaft China-Europa,＂ ＂Music Library for Chinese Youth,＂ ＂Chinese Music Center in Bonn,＂ etc., that were long forgotten, resurfaced in these archives and regained people's attention. Information yielded from these records reveals that many folk singers participated in the Chinese Folk Song Competition in 1967, with the most majority performing Hakka folksongs. In the brochure for the Competition, there are several pictures of the Hakka Folksong Competition as well as documentation of aboriginal people's music. These are from the Folksong Documentation Movement, led by Shih Wei-liang in 1967. One picture substantiates the content and date of the Competition. Furthermore, the same catalog preserves audio recordings of the Competition of that year. It recreates circumstances of the final contest ＂live＂ and the voice of Huang Chinfeng's singing. After reviewing relevant documents and my interviews with Huang Chin-feng, I attest to the authenticity of the recordings and confirm that Huang was not the champion of the year. Intensive cross-examining uncovers a close relationship between the Chinese Folksong Competition, Hakka Folksong Competition, and the Folksong Documentation Movement of 1967. Because of the on-site visit of the Documentation team, a greater proportion of Hakka singers also entered the Chinese Folksong Competition. I infer that the Chinese Folksong Competition inclined more toward promotion rather than competition, and the participants were closely related to the singers ＂uncovered＂ by the Documentation team.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202203-202204010015-202204010015-129-179,215,2022,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

However, due to a number of historical factors, most investigations have centered on Hakka villages in northern and southern Taiwan, with research on the religious cultures of central Taiwan's Hakka villages only just beginning to develop. This is especially the case for Taichung's Dongshi District, located at the confluence of Provincial Highway 3 and Provincial Highway 8, despite the fact that over 70% of its residents are Hakka. For these reasons, this article focuses on the largely overlooked phenomenon of Hakka Buddhism ( 客家釋教), namely Buddhist ritual practitioners ( 緇門香花) from the Ruide Altar ( 瑞德壇) of the Longhua Buddhist Association ( 龍華佛教會). These specialists perform a wide variety of rituals, including offering rites, mortuary rites, and salvation rites for hungry ghosts.

Religion and Ethnic Relations: The Cult of Sin Si Sze Ya in Malaysia,"Chang Han-pi, Pek Wee Chuen, Tsai Fen-fang","localization, ethnic relations, regionalization, cult of Sin Si Sze Ya, Malaysia, beliefs","During the nineteenth century, Hakka of Huizhou 惠州 descent were recruited to mine tin ore in Malaysia, with tin mining concentrated in the Negeri Sembilan and Selangor regions. Due to numerous difficulties encountered during processes of migration, including harsh physical labor as well as internal quarrels plus feuding among fellow Chinese, these Hakka migrants needed spiritual support. Such circumstances led to the growth of a cult to local heroes known as Sin Si Sze Ya 仙四師爺. One notable aspect of these beliefs is that migrants did not bring them along from China; instead, they grew out of and became embedded in Malaysia's history and social development. The current Hakka belt of tin ore in West Malaysia did not exist before British colonization, but subsequently evolved into a living space of ethnic interactions. This resulted from long-term processes of regionalization (Hakka settlement, spread of religious beliefs, economic development plus interactions among different ethnic groups, urbanization, etc.) that featured a wide range of peoples (different subgroups of Hakka plus other ethnic groups) and places (hillside areas, tin mining regions, etc.). Such regionalization led to the cult of Sin Si Sze Ya expanding in various forms of localization due to the vicissitudes of history that render cultural diversity and localization processes among Hakka migrants more visible, and enable us to better comprehend social developments and ethnic relations in Malaysia. Based on historical factors such as economic development and religious localization, this study maps the relationship between religious beliefs and ethnic interactions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202112-202201030018-202201030018-97-148,214,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
When Religion Transcends Ethnicity: A Temple Property Dispute and the Transformation of Overseas Chinese Power Structures in Kuala Lumpur,Ng Pui Bun,"trustees, Hakka immigrants, Kuala Lumpur, Sin Si Sze Ya Temple, Chinese communal power structures","The Sin Si Sze Ya Temple ( 仙四師爺宮) in Kuala Lumpur was one of the first sacred sites founded by that city's Overseas Chinese community. It was built after the end of the Selangor War (1867-1873) in 1881 under the leadership of the Chinese Kapitan Yap Ah Loy 葉亞來 (1837-1885), who represented Hakka immigrants from Huizhou 惠州. This article focuses on a dispute over the Sin Si Sze Ya Temple's property that occurred in 1907 in order to examine transformations in the power structures of Kuala Lumpur's Chinese community during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The dispute involved a lawsuit in which the plaintiffs, who were Yap Ah Loy's heirs, claimed hereditary rights to the temple and its property. By analyzing the causes of this dispute, as well as its resolution, this article reveals how the winning and losing parties represented a transition from an old power structure to a new one. This can be seen in the court's judgement to require the formation of a new management system of twelve representatives from different Chinese native places serving as temple trustees (受託人), including three representatives from Canton (廣府), three representatives from Huizhou, and one representative each from Fujian 福建, Dapu 大埔, Hainan 海南, Chaozhou 潮州, Guangxi 廣西 and Jiayingzhou 嘉應州. In addition, this article considers the significance of this new trustee system, whose members crossed both native place and dialect group boundaries, as one manifestation of changing Chinese communal power structures in Kuala Lumpur. In order to clarify the historical import of these transformations, this article will explore how Chinese elites used the English legal term ＂trustee＂ as an equivalent of Chinese term 受託人, and how this usage shaped management systems for other local temples.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202112-202201030018-202201030018-149-195,214,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

One example of this phenomenon may be found in Shicang 石倉 (located in Songyang 松陽 County, Chuzhou 處州 Prefecture), where Hakka migrants from Tingzhou 汀州 Prefecture in Western Fujian became a prominent force in local development during the early and mid-Qing eras. These migrants not only brought in much-needed manpower for the exploitation of mountain resources and the enhancement of Shicang's socioeconomic development, but also transmitted numerous cultural traditions from their ancestral homeland, especially the worship of deities and ancestors as well as other ritual activities. This article combines local historical documents such as genealogies and ritual texts with data collected during fieldwork to systematically analyze the religious traditions and ritual practices of Hakka communities in Shicang since the Qing dynasty, such as the worship of deities and ancestors. In addition, this article focuses on the interaction between migrant and indigenous religious cultures, as well as the role religion played in the social life of Shicang villagers and processes of migrant localization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202112-202201030018-202201030018-197-271,214,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Cultural Agency of the Borderlands: Transnational Cinematic Networks and Their Impacts on Rangoon Chinatown's Early Cold War,Lu Tasaw Hsin-chun,"transnational film industry, borderlands, Cold War, Chinatown in Rangoon, music and dance films","During the Cold War, there existed high dynamics of musical flows in Rangoon's Chinatown. This resulted from its unique location as a cultural crossroads linking South Asia and Southeast Asia, as well as one connected to a ＂homeland＂ perceived amongst Sino-Chinese peoples and the international world. This paper delves into such musical flows within the intricate transnational networks of the film industry at the time. On the one hand, the trades that Chinese, Indian, and the Hollywood's entrepreneurs had built prior to the Cold War continued to give a remarkable impact on the Sino-Burmese musical practices. On the other hand, the political tensions in the Cold War between the US/British-India and Russia/China led to the group's anxieties. How did the music and dance in films play a significant role in soothing and uplifting their spirit in their daily life is a key question. In conclusion, the concept of ＂borderlands＂ is suggested for the understanding of Rangoon's Chinatown as a space free of political doctrinairism which can go across the rigid borderlines of ethnicity, class, and reality.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202109-202110010018-202110010018-1-47,213,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Trans-Regional Entanglement of Sound and Technology: A Preliminary Study on the Recording Studios of Mandarin Popular Music in Taiwan,Cheng Ming,"recording studio, audio technology, popular music","The production of popular music generally occurs in recording studios. The musicians, singers, engineers, and other members of the music industry work together before the completed work is distributed through various media. The thriving music industry of post-war Taiwan has proceeded in unison with the development of recording studios. The Platinum Recording Studio (白金錄音室), founded in 1980 in northern Taiwan has been the leading studio of recording industry for decades. Numerous records of different genres, including classical music, mandarin popular music and music clips for TV commercials, have been recorded and mixed here. Although the Platinum Recording Studio occupies such a prominent position in the history of music industry, studies on musical activities and the multi-lateral relationships inside the studio has not attracted enough academic attention. In the late 1970s, the founder, Chui-ching Yeh (葉垂青), and his father, Chin-tai Yeh (葉進泰), decided to improve the overall quality of the records made in Taiwan. Hence, they invited a recording engineer from Japan, Giichi Hirata (平田義一), to design and coordinate the construction of the Platinum Recording Studio. Accompanied by the young Chui-ching Yeh, Hirata conducted several experimental recording sessions with musicians from Taiwan and Japan during and after the launching of the studio. As a recording studio where a certain sonic culture was produced, the Platinum distinguished itself from others with its cutting-edge equipments and Japanese-trained professional expertise. By unveiling details around the establishment of the Platinum Recording Studio, we can gain a clearer understanding of the entanglement between the importation of audio technology after the Second World War and the existing sonic culture in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202109-202110010018-202110010018-49-95,213,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Morality and Order: The External Tension and Inner Discrepancy of Yiguan Dao's Development in Contemporary Thailand,Lin Yu-sheng,"morality and order, Yiguan Dao, religious organization, tension, Thailand","When Yiguan Dao spreads to other countries, it also brings along its management mechanism developed in Taiwan. Meanwhile, it has to face different political-social-cultural contexts and various development stages of religious organizations. The purpose of this study is to discuss how Yiguan Dao coordinates global appropriation and local adaption to maintain a balance between the external social circumstances and its inner Yiguan Dao members in Thailand. I tackle the issue from the sociological perspective of religion to examine the tension and development of religious organizations. On the one hand, Yiguan Dao uses a state-promoted education of ＂morality＂ to reduce its conflicts with the Buddhists in Thai society-a pattern evolved from its experiences in Taiwan, China and Singapore. On the other hand, as it alleviates its tensions with Thai society, Yiguan Dao also incurs discrepancies among its members. The emergent new middle class constitutes the foundation of Yiguan Dao members in Thailand. As opposed to ＂morality＂ they place more importance on the value of symbolic ＂order.＂ With this analysis, I argue that to study the pattern of religious development and tension, one must pay close attention to global influences and individual socio-cultural contexts. Though the state mechanism of Thailand is different from that of Taiwan, China, or Singapore, the Yiguan Dao in Thailand applies a global pattern to accommodate with the Thai state, and uses it to resolve its conflicts with Thai society. In addition, the discrepancies within religious organizations that grow out of this social tension-easing process must also be identified through the cultural symbolic aspect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202109-202110010018-202110010018-97-144,213,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

This paper examines the case of the Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple's annual Chingay parade in a historical and anthropological perspective. Through these questions, I will point out that the Kapitan system has disappeared for many years, but its essence still remains and manifests in the Chinese communities in the Malay Peninsula. In the Chingay parade, the Tiong-Hua Association of Johor Bahru, which status equals the Kapitan of the past, is consider a leader of the local Chinese community. It maintains a good relation with the state government and the royal family of Johor, and is able to speak out and communicate with the government on behalf of the Johor Bahru Chinese community. On the other hand, the ruling authority also considers it a bridge of communication with the Chinese community of Johor Bahru. People engage with politics through them.

Macau paohui developed into small-scale non-government mutual aid organizations. Members in a paohui, generally ranging from about twenty to over a hundred people, might be related by location, occupation, or other backgrounds but were certainly not restricted to any one of these criteria. They form an association voluntarily, mainly for the purposes of collective worship and helping each other to make a living. And the association related itself to a local community temple through the pao. This paper presents, for the first time, the history of the paohui in Macau and reveals how the social structure of local communities changed in the process of urbanization and modernization in Macau in the twentieth century before 1966 as seen from the perspective of paohui activities. In short, the phenomena of Macau paohui represent the transition from the traditional Chinese temple-centric territory society to the modern urban society, which has detached from religious and territory bonds.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202106-202107050013-202107050013-43-107,212,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

This study intends to trace the source of her cult from local gazetteers. The ＂Story of Ni Ngou Nio＂ in Qiongtai zhi (瓊臺志) of Ming dynasty offers the earliest related account. In early Ming, the cult of Ni Ngou Nio fell into the ＂licentious cult＂ category. Local people continued to introduce favorable factors into the cult. By modifying related legends and integrating elements of Lightening God, they re-invented her image and either sent her into an imperial-decreed temple or worshipped her as an affiliated deity with other extant deities. The cult therefore enjoyed long and prosperous growth in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Its alliance with the cult of Madam Xian generated new legends that strengthened their bond, making the pair a common combination in local cults. As the prototype of Goddess of Fire and Thunder, stories of Ni Ngou Nio, had faded away. However, the cult of Goddess of Fire and Thunder is still thriving. It retains characteristics of thunder, lightning, and fire.

Cultural Heritage and National Imaginings: Time and Space in the Interpretation of Monuments from Japanese Era in Tainan,Yao Ming-li,"national identity, Japanese era, national imagining, heritage interpretation","John Urry and Jonas Larsen maintain that cultural heritage is a vehicle of national identity. When one sees the image of Buckingham Palace, Eiffel Tower, or Taj Mahal, it is the country's name that immediately comes to mind. Focusing on the interpretation of the cultural heritage, this study argues that a certain kind of heritage sites from the Japanese era is perceived as an insignia with socio-cultural significance as well as an embodiment of Taiwanese identity. The transformation of cultural policy of post-war Taiwan reflects the shift of the culture discourse, and also raises the concern how those monuments which were mostly associated with the foreign rule can incite ＂Taiwanese＂ national imagining. The key concept of historical and territorial notions which serves as the fundamental elements of ＂national pattern＂ constitutes the analytical framework of this study. I use various types of resources to explain the way in which the state of ROC built up the cultural discourse of Taiwan. Through those interpretive approaches, one single heritage site becomes a sphere which not only conjoin a myriad of affective realms, but also re-marks the boundary of Taiwanese national community.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202106-202107050013-202107050013-161-214,212,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The pudu purgatorial ritual has undergone a reproduction process, already different from the ghost worship ritual traditionally conducted in the City God Temple.

Even the annual ＂cangue-bearing＂ activity popular in recent years exhibits traces of cultural production. On August 1st, 2019, the Chiayi Intangible Cultural Heritage Review Committee passed a bill that included the City God procession as a part of the Chungyuan Festival, making the Nine Pillars (ritual organization) of the Chiayi City God Temple eligible for intangible cultural heritage application.

In 2010, Taiwan's Bureau of Cultural Heritage, Ministry of Culture also designated Hakka bayin as an Important Traditional Performing Arts. Until 2019, there are 10 Hakka bayin ensembles or individual musicians designated as preservers of this intangible cultural heritage.

How do they participate in different ways in these institutional initiatives and activities? What kind of challenges do they face respectively and how do they manage to overcome the challenges? In addition, how do scholars and government officials engage in these projects, contributing to the transmission of Hakka bayin? In response to the bottom-up research approach commonly adopted in ethnomusicology, anthropology, and folklore studies in recent years, this article explores the ways members from Hakka bayin communities, scholars, and government agencies promote the sustainability of a heritagized cultural practice in its changing ecology. First I analyze how scholars and government officials continue to shape the institutional framework for preserving Hakka bayin and other heritagized cultural practices. Secondly, I examine how musicians, scholars, and government officials adapt to the heritagization of Hakka bayin.

Dubbed as ＂lumber for the poor,＂ bamboo is a local material readily available everywhere in Taiwan, and has been put to extensive use by all ethnic groups. However, just as Laurajane Smith states in her definition of ＂cultural heritage＂ (2006), the techniques and products of bamboo craft was not considered traditional craft until after a continuously changing process. The Taiwanese perception of bamboo craft, that evolves from a craft for livelihood, industrial merchandise to traditional craft, exactly reflects the overlapping and misplaced positions of producers and consumers in the global chain of production. It also affects the tug of war between protection measures and the heritagized cultural practices. This study uses literature review, visual image analysis and field research data (mainly collected between May and November, 2019) to explore the following issues; the industrialization of bamboo craft during the Japanese colonial era, bamboo craft that went through the period of US-funded product development in the post-World War II years, and the post-industrial transformation of bamboo craft and industry that both intertwine and diverge in the heritagization process. Furthermore, this research intends to clarify the subjects, aims and impacts of ＂culture＂ that is so often taken for granted as the discursive axis of the heritagization process, particularly its relationship with practices of intangible cultural heritage protection.

The Production of Scriptures in Vietnamese Sect Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa,Chung Yun-ying,"Nguyễn Hội Chân, Wu Gong Jing, Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa, Ngô Lợi, Vietnam","This paper focuses on the emergence of Vietnamese sect Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa's scriptures. Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa's is a native Vietnamese sect founded in the early 19th century by Ngô Lợi (1831-1890) of Kì in Bửu Sơn Kì Hương. Its mission area is mainly in An Giang province. This sect deserves our attention mainly because it preserves the tradition of hand copying scriptures in Chinese characters. The scriptures in Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa falls into three categories. The first is the monographs written by Ngô Lợi and Nguyễn Hội Chân during their founding years. The second is the Buddhist scriptures introduced from China. The third is the Chinese moral books. These scriptures circulated within the sect, after countless copying and recopying, occasioned some changes in the scriptures, either done on purpose or by mistakes. Such differences serve to illustrate the faith and vitality of the sect that was dedicated to the legacy of traditional scriptures. The dominant visible image of Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa is Lord Guan. However, barely one sixth of the scriptures are related to him. In contrast, a great proportion of the scriptures are about Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy. The fact indicates that Guanyin is the nucleus of the sect, while Lord Guan is merely the outward emblem of Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa. This article describes the phenomenon in terms of its contents and images. Ngô Lợi and Nguyễn Hội Chân, who are regarded as ＂Fire tower of the three teachings＂ (Tam Giáo Hỏa Lầu三教火樓) are primary authors of the Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa. There are three aspects of their composition and alteration of the scriptures. The first is the heritage of Buddhist scriptures. The second is the transformation of the Chinese moral books. The third is the works created in the name of Wu Gong Jing (五公經). Because of its capacity of composing scripture, Tứ Ân Hiếu Nghĩa has become a Buddhism-centered folk sect that integrates Vietnamese cultural characteristics.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202103-202103290008-202103290008-167-224,211,2021,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Due to the coming of settler immigrants since the colonial era, their settlement had largely been reduced and their traditional rituals forced out of native locale. In this study, I use the ＂boat ritual＂ (palunan), an age-group initiation ritual of Lidaw Tribe, as an example to discuss the intricate relationships between ＂ritual landscape＂ and ＂cultural heritage.＂ I pose three questions in this study. First, as a kind of initiation, how does the palunan ritual link to recognizing or remembering environmental landscape and engaging a dialogue with cultural transformation? Second, different age groups respond differently to the ritual practices and training process, exhibiting an interweaving of diverse memories and historical events. How does the ritual correspond to discourse of the collective identity and legendary tales in order to generate cultural significance? Third, how do their ritual rules and family politics affect their collective memories and become latent text for cultural heritage narrative? From a perspective of ritual landscape and cultural heritage, this paper intends to show how altered ways of living and environmental shift caused by urban development brought impact on the contemporary rituals. Through the historical records and collective memories of the boat ritual in different periods of time, I reflect on the importance of ritual landscape that holds the collective memories together. Taken the village rituals as a participatory action of cultural heritage, I offer that ritual memory is an active presentation of the tribal family politics and social action.

Since April of 2015, I have been participating in the action of Bunun people of Haidun, Taidong who return to their ancestral settlements. Meanwhile I continue to conduct a project that surveys the ancestral Bunun residences and make field sketches along the Xinwulu river basin. I have uncovered a phenomenon that their narratives of the past superimpose on the historical landscape (images such as houses or overgrown fields). In addition, the ＂body＂ serves as a platform that interconnects various symbols. It revitalizes as well as reorganizes memory fragments through physical senses such as coolness of the breeze, thirst, walking, soreness, sounds, etc. On the other hand, the homecoming hikes also generate contemporary common memory. Each participant harvests respective gains in the same event while constructing a mutual-assimilating experience. On the whole, they strengthen their self-identification of ＂indigeneity,＂ their status as indigenous individuals and as members of indigenous people are further made distinct, subsequent actions are taken. The purpose of this study is to deal with the following questions. How does ＂homecoming＂ mean to contemporary indigenous people?

It aims to demonstrate how clothing can be recognized as symbols bearing historical and cultural significances in the face of globalization. In the craze of recent cultural heritage preservation, minority clothing from remote areas also get to be displayed on the stage of fashion industry. By juxtaposing tradition and creativity, one seeks to evince authenticity. This research describes the diverse and complicated aspects of ethnic clothing with four case studies. The first case, ＂Li Jin Qipao,＂ demonstrates how the cultural construction of nationalism can be presented as performance in a fashion show. The second case, ＂Yifangbu,＂ uses techniques of fashion design to deconstruct the minority clothing context and reassemble it in a creative way. The third case, ＂Gaoshanqing,＂ presents how a fashion designer adapts and appropriates elements of ethnic clothing to produce garments that caters to popular fashion aesthetic. The fourth case, ＂S'uraw,＂ emphasizes the revival of traditional cultural contexts through ethnic clothing. A first glance, the four cases mentioned above could be described as rustic, fancy, or authentic according to notions from the fashion industry or cultural heritage revival. In fact, if we take them as symbol carriers, trying to extract the historical and cultural contexts behind the production and presentation, we will have a new perspective. To sum up, the relation between fashion, clothing design and social culture cannot be reduced to terms like ＂fancy＂ or ＂rustic.＂ Behind these over-simplified terms, there is a whole set of complex and diverse meanings as well as cultural contexts. At the same time, these cases inform us how people involved in the ethnic clothing re-production industry employ ideas of fashion design and presentation to link up China, Taiwan and the global world.

Umbrella or Spear? A Case Study on the Cultural Reproduction in Kulakul (Warrior Dance) of 'Atolan Amis,Lin Fang-chen,"reproduction, kulakul, cultural heritage, recreation, 'Atolan Amis","In this study, I investigate the 'Atolan Amis' dispute of using either umbrella (linay) or spear (kutang) in their warrior dance of kulakul. The dispute serves as a basis for discussing Pierre Bourdieu's concept of hysteresis and reproduction theory. I also bring in the idea of recreation from UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage for a dialogue. Although UNESCO considers the perpetuation of intangible cultural heritage hinges on human ＂re-creation,＂ there is not yet a clear definition. 'Atolan Amis' ritual objects, umbrella and spear, are not only associated with different generations' recognition and memory but also reflect the cultural sphere Amis construct according to their habitus and cultural capital. They are indications of the hysteresis caused by the government's intervention. When the significance of current habitus and capital no longer carry weight, opinion leaders and leaders of age groups pick them up to compete in a new field, hence the cultural reproduction. The choice of using umbrella or spear in the kulakul ritual dance can provide the UNESCO a reference when defining ＂re-creation＂ for enacting a system to safeguard intangible cultural heritage.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202012-202101040017-202101040017-145-196,210,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

I examine its scores in Guandong Han music, Chaozhou music, Minnan ancient music ensemble, beiguang music and the shisanyin (＂thirteen sounds＂), analyze its intertextuality, and probe into the variations between their musical pattern and content. According to my field work, the zheng scores of Yulianhuan, which make use of the jiahua (＂embellishment＂; literally ＂adding flowers＂) technique, share a common background in the performance among local music genres in southern Fujian, eastern Guangdong, and Taiwan. Meanwhile, there also exists a significant degree of variations. The five pieces of Yulianhuan zheng scores I studied reflects that a tune often generates multiple versions. This phenomenon highlights the intricate intertextuality of cross-genre qupai relations. The three versions of Yulianhuan from southern Fujian, Hakka, and Chaozhou share a basic skeleton melody, while the two versions prevalent in the music genre system of Taiwan demonstrate more similarities to the southern Fujian rendition. The former derives from geographic and humanistic background; the latter a result of the immigration culture. The tune title Yulianhuan has not only circulated in different area and between different genres of music, it further translates into a text for zheng performance.

In terms of playwriting, there is an emphasis on highlighting characteristics of the epoch with themes on humanities. Yu Dagang's play, Wang Kuei's Betrayal of Guiying (1970) in Peking Opera, is an illustrative example. The play debuted with all-around critical acclaim. It probes into the inner world of Guiying, elaborating on her feelings. The actress Guo Xiaozhuang's interpretation of Guiying becomes her signature role on stage. The Taiwan Bangzi Opera's version of Wang Kuei's Betrayal of Guiying (1990) highlights Guiying's devotion with layers of perspectives accumulated from daily life. Wang Hailing's performance of Guiying features sophisticated singing and choreography. The plot leans towards investigation and confirmation. It not only witnesses the fully-unleashed art of Taiwan Bangzi Opera, but also highlights Guiying's subjectivity. Liao Qiongzhi's Wang Kuei's Betrayal of Guiying (1998) in kua-a opera is a script based on her experience in theatre with an editorial perspective that takes into consideration her actual practice on stage. Liao's version of script showcases creative adaption and modified image of Guiying, placing more weight on examining circumstances of events. Liao's interpretation of Guiying is one of her personal masterpieces, corresponding to her own life experience. By analyzing the textual derivation of the three plays, their interpretation, and individual performer's acting, this study demonstrates the various facets of traditional opera in contemporary time. In addition, it explicates the significance of texts and performance in the development of traditional Taiwan Opera.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202009-202010060014-202010060014-7-65,209,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Aesthetics of Canonization in Traditional Taiwanese Opera since 1990s,Fu Yu-hui,"Taiwanese Opera in modern theatre, Taiwanese nationalism, canonization, institutionalized and scripted system","This essay attempts to summarize how Taiwanese Opera (gezaixi) in modern theatre have been canonized and how some of the works have been constructed in the aesthetics of ＂canonization＂ through the ＂institutionalization of the scripted system,＂ while Taiwanese Opera itself is also responding to the national identity of Taiwanese nationalism. The most important thing is how public subsidies and the intervention of intellectual elites have transformed the tendency of ＂canonization＂ since the 1990s. The ＂canonization＂ of Taiwanese Operas in modern theatre involves many different phases of difinitions, implictions, and observations. Under the industrialized system of modern theatre, the concept of the work is constructed and finalized by the team of professionals. That is completely different from the improvisational performing system in traditional Taiwanese Opera, which is unique and has been passed down from generation to generation. It is imperative to examine the works of ＂canonization＂ and the politics in the aesthetic, along with the emerging political consciousness of nationalism and localization. My views will be illustrated by three productions of traditional Taiwanese Operas: India Coral Reblossoming by Chen Mei-yun Taiwanese Opera Troupe in 2001, A Story of Love and Feud by Holo Taiwanese Opera Troupe in 2005, and Deathless Beauty by Tang Mei-yun Taiwanese Opera Troupe in 2012.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202009-202010060014-202010060014-67-110,209,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Through the reproduction and transmission of technology, the nature of gezixi opera performance evolved with the increase of TV influence, formatting a performance aesthetics that is different from that of theatre arts. The caliber of TV gezixi music accumulated from generations of predecessors' exuberant energy also shone through. It followed the convention of inner stage and radio gezixi and developed a feature of newly composed tunes. That feature also affected its musical practice once it entered modern indoor and outdoor stage theatres. It not only inherited traditional aesthetics, concepts and techniques but also left numerous works of high artistic value to be appreciated by successors. The TV gezixi has fallen into decline in the 1990s. Since 2003, there has only been one work: The Dragon Legend, produced by Chen Yalan in 2012. As the single instance within the decade, in an age when TV gezixi nearly went extinct, what was the aspiration of this production? The purpose of this study is to explore the motivation and modified usage of newly composed tunes in TV gezixi. I first analyze the musical formula, patterns of creation, tune styles and modern implementation of new TV gezixi tunes and Karaoke. Then I concentrate on discussing the music content of TV gezixi Dragon Legend, and composer Liu Wenliang's brand new take on composing gezixi tunes.

Contemporary Cross-Genre Performance of Kun Opera and Traditional Japanese Opera in 1998-2018,Lin Ho-chun,"Noh theatre, Kyōgen, Kabuki, Noh, Kun Opera","The beginning of communication between Kun Opera and traditional Japanese Opera in modern times can be traced to Mei Lanfang's debut performance in Japan in 1919. Due to the changes of political circumstances after China and Japan established official diplomatic relations in 1972, the Kun Opera troupes in China received invitations to perform in Japan, leading to the founding of Konh-Ge-Ki Club (Japanese Kun Opera Friendship Society). It broke the boundary between national borders and ethnic groups, creating opportunities for cross-cultural and/or cross-theatrical genre collaboration, constructing a new aspect for the traditional operas to perform in modern times. In 1988, the Jiangsu Kun Opera Troupe and Izumi school of Kyōgen staged a production of Autumn River in the Japanese National Noh Theatre, with Zhang Jiqing and Nomura Mansaku as the leading performers. This precedent of cross-genre joint performance ushered in a series of trial collaborations between Kun Opera performers both in China and Taiwan and performers of Noh, Kyōgen and Kabuki in Japan. Henceforth, actors from both sides seek cooperation of various forms and degrees. It is not only a cross-national, cross-genre, and cross-cultural exchange of art forms, but also a creative strategy of the traditional operas to grow out of ＂classical vs. classical＂ mode and explore directions of contemporary opera performance, interpretation and recreation. Based on the joint production of Kun Opera and traditional Japanese Opera staged between 1998 and 2018, I will analyze their modes and techniques of performance, summarize results of pros and cons, and explain the significance of such collaborative performances.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202009-202010060014-202010060014-131-168,209,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Subsequently, the Zhejiang Kunqu Opera Troupe adapted it into a Kunqu script. The production premiered at Hong Kong Chi Lin Nunnery in 2012. This play is based on three Buddhist sutras: Ajatasatru sutra 未生怨經, Mahayana Mahaparinirvana sutra 大般涅槃經, and Amitayurdhyana sutra 觀無量壽佛經. It tells about the story of Ajase, who held enmity with his father in previous incarnation, killed his father, and imprisoned his mother in this life. But he finally repented and became one of Buddha disciples. The theme and content is closely related with the practice and notion of salvation of the Pure Land Buddhist belief.

Sanli village, Zhuoxi Township, Hualian County, is the place that is densely populated with the Duda group. In this village, there is a relatively great number of old women who are good at weaving and keep the custom of weaving the clothes as dowry for their daughters or granddaughters. While other villages enthusiastically participate in community building and cultural industry, Duda people in Sanli focus on the inheritance of weaving culture by household work and performance of annual celebration of festival in village instead of pursuing the profit from the craft market. This study aims to analyze the mechanism of inheritance of weaving culture as the practice of everyday life in Sanli, and to show how the weaving culture continuously exists while women, being of the female gender in the division of labor, are under the influence of such factors as the changing social economy in community, daily labor work, the learning network, religious beliefs and customs. At the same time, through the women's habitus and strategic choice, the change and innovation of weaving culture are made possible. Thus, in the process of dialectic of structures and habitus, weaving culture and ethnic identity are constructed through bodily practice and memory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202009-202010060014-202010060014-211-274,209,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

In contrast, cases of Confucian ritual masters presiding over the Lord's mansion are rarely seen. It is the tradition of Confucian worship to offer animal sacrifice, while the Daoists abstain from meat and wine during their jiao purgatory ritual. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, the cult of Epidemic Lords had long been considered licentious and unorthodox. How the Confucian ritual masters of local cult adapted the Daoist rituals to promote the legitimacy of the cult of Epidemic Lords and to meet the people's need to ward off calamities is a religious cultural issue worthy of investigation. Premises of the Lord's Mansion and the ritual practice there have always been off limits to outsiders. I had the rare opportunity to observe and investigate an extensive and meticulous ritual in Qing'an Temple of Xigang, Tainan, which is famous for preserving a complete ritual tradition. I also compare it with rituals in Changxing Temple, Sucuo, Tainan, and Donglong Temple of Donggang, Pingdong. My field trip to the Zhangzhou area of Fujian to examine rituals associated with the cult of Epidemic Lords was an attempt to probe into the southern Fujian origin of the cult in Taiwan. ＂When rites are missing (from the upper echelon), recover them from the peasants.＂ Taiwan has obviously better preserved the cult and rituals of Epidemic Lords.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202006-202007070017-202007070017-1-89,208,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

By the Ming-Qing era, silkworm production and silk weaving constituted a large proportion of the local economic life. In addition, due to continuous improvements in the canal system, links between Jiangnan and imperial China's political center became closer. Therefore, research on sericulture customs at Taihu Lake and its surrounding regions, especially Hangzhou, Jiaxing and Huzhou, naturally involves the study of Grand Canal culture. This paper draws on previous studies and primary source materials, including late Qing and Republican-era newspapers and magazines, local gazetteers, field survey reports and other materials, to explore a wide range of aspects related to Jiangnan sericulture (including silk flower penance ritual, squeezing silk flower temple festival, incense fairs, water fairs, etc.). The paper's structure is as follows: First of all, I introduce the Silk Flower Religious Festival as intangible cultural heritage according to the distribution of the Hang-Jia-Hu region. Secondly, religious views in two Huzhou Daoist scriptures (The Precious Penance of the Silk Flower and Silk Precious Rites) are analysed, including technical factors pertaining to their special vocabulary.

"History and Modern Transition of the Classical Tibetan Ritual Shon: An Anthropological Investigation of Guge Shon in mNga' ris Highland, Tibet",Ren Yunjuan,"performing art, intangible cultural heritage, Tibetan ritual song and dance, Guge shon, mNga'ris","This paper explores the tradition and modern transition of Tibetan old ritual art ＂shon＂ and calls for attention from both the government and the private sector to consider intangible cultural heritage as an integral whole. Shon is an ancient ritual dance that has existed in the mNga' ris highland for thousands of years as a living heritage. It is said that shon originated from ancient Zhangzhung tribal alliance. Later, it was performed during the Guge reign as a court dance before its transmission to the mNga' ris people. It is still performed there as a living heritage. It was listed as a National Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008 for its rich textual tradition and sophisticated rituals. My study on the origin, evolution and cultural connotation of Guge shon is based on historical data, field work and observance of the present performance with an anthropological perspective. Specifically, this paper aims to account for why, how, when shon was performed and by whom. I first trace the etymology of the word ＂shon＂ and analyze the structure of shon based on historical manuscripts and mural images. I then refer to various sources and give an account of the tradition and evolution of Guge shon. Finally, I explore the multiple aspects of Guge shon's oral tradition in Rong-chung, Zanda county. To sum up, this diachronic and synchronic study of the Guge shon is a response to the discovery of Yungdrung shon (the heritage of the Zhangzhung culture in India).

"The Chanhe Tune, Fuzhou Tune, and Local Tune in the Buddhist Music in Fujian, and Their Connotations and Relationships",Zhou Jingchun,"Local Tune, Fuzhou Tune, Chanhe Tune, Buddhist music","The Buddhist music in Fujian has various appellations, including Chanhe Tune, Fuzhou Tune, or Local Tune. Relations between these three are still to be explored in a systematic way. It is a conventional concept that they are used by different groups, with different content of lyrics and singing styles. Large Buddhist temples employ the Fuzhou Tune and Local Tune, while lay Buddhist Xianghua monks chant in Chanhe Tune. However, based on previous scholarship, oral history from my own survey, analysis on historical data, and music itself, I have reached a conclusion that indicates otherwise. I argue that Fuzhou Tune, Local Tune, and Chanhe Tune, in the context of Buddhist music in Fuzhou, refer to the same form of singing. Chanhe Tune is a form of singing employed by large temples in Fuzhou, such as Yongquan Temple, Xichan Temple, etc. Xianghua monks' singing are mostly picked up from these places. The Chanhe Tune, by general definition, includes Buddhist music, Daoist music, and a fusion of folk music that integrates the above. It is prevalent in Fuzhou, Southern Fujian, as well as in the temples and local societies in Taiwan. In this study, I will clarify the essential notions of Buddhist music in Fujian and their musical features so as to shed light on the research of Buddhist music in Fujian and Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202006-202007070017-202007070017-275-304,208,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Implications of the Shift of Wealth Motives in Yangliuqing Woodblock Prints,Yang Yujun,"woodblock prints, nianhua, god of wealth, lunar new year, Yangliuqing","Interpretation of woodblock prints (nianhua) is very different from that of sophisticated literati paintings. Even though there exists a shared system of pictorial vocabulary, various levels of aesthetic virtuosity renders the interpretation difficult. Even so, certain motives related to the desire for wealth demonstrate consistent characteristics, some with extraordinary enlarged size, and others with refined details. I will study the type of prints produced in the town of Yangliuqing that feature the god of wealth and make comparisons with similar prints from other areas to elucidate the nature of wealth and the material culture implied. Secondly, I will analyze the attires and accessories of the characters related to the god of wealth, to argue that their architype are people from the very bottom of the social stratum. I will further argue that the imaginative scenes depicted in the prints might have been an imitation of New Year ritual troupes masquerading as gods of wealth to bring families they visited with wealth and treasure.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202003-202003310010-202003310010-11-60,207,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
On the ＂Unknown Plot＂ of the White Snake Legend in the Woodblock Prints of Theater Scenes,Lin Chih-ying,"woodblock prints of theater scenes, the White Snake Legend, snake killing, woodblock prints","The woodblock prints of theater scenes are a vehicle introducing theatrical stories into folk life. Images of many characters are directly associated with their profile on stage that audience can recognize the story at a glance. In this study, I analyze the woodblock prints that feature the White Snake Legend, starting with the ＂snake killing＂ plot that is unknown on stage but popular in the shuochang chantefable genre. I argue that the woodblock print scenes were also inspired by the shuochang chantefable. Because shuochang is a narrative intermittent with prose and verse, there is no visual clues for the painters/carvers to refer to; they have to depend on their own creativity. At the same time, they adapt the theatrical scenes, adding or altering elements in the picture layout to suit the purpose of festivity or evil-dispelling exorcism. Secondly, I discuss a series of 24 White Snake woodblock prints. I point out that the White Snake in this series still retains her demonic nature, indicating it to be a survival from the narrative's early stage of the development of the story and deviates from the audience's expectation of human warmth. Some plots that are not found in later theater stages are very likely the creation of painters. With the narrative framework constructed by pictures and corresponding captions, the painters are allowed ample liberty to insert a new plot. In this case, though woodblock prints of theater scenes seem to draw their material from theatrical scripts or stage character profiles, they are not mere subordinates to theater, but a vehicle with individual subjectivity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202003-202003310010-202003310010-61-110,207,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Trade Network of Woodblock Prints in Northern China during the Qing Dynasty,"Lai Hui-min, Wang Chung-chi","trade, Kyakhta, woodblock prints","Russian scholar Boris Lyvovich Riftin pointed out that, thanks to the trade in Kyakhta in the 1830s and 1840s, there are about 6,000 Chinese New Year woodblock prints in Russia today. Another scholar, Aleksandr Korsak, investigated imports from China in Kyakhta - the paintings, woodblock prints, Chinese and Mongolian books - and showed that between 1847 and 1851, the annual imports of sugar, medicine, daily necessities, textiles, handicrafts and miscellaneous items totalled around 304,902 rubles, 5% of average annual trading value in Kyakhta (6,211,768 rubles). The annual trading value of paintings, books, and miscellaneous items was insignificant, accounting for only 1.4% of the annual trading value at 88,063 rubles. These studies on the trade in Kyakhta demonstrate that woodblock prints were sold in Russia. How were these Chinese New Year woodblock prints transported from their production sites to Russia? The trade season in Kyakhta started in winter, while folk prints went on sale from the ninth of September every year. Numerous resellers who had placed orders would arrive. Those from other provinces even had to use carts and boats to transport the prints. It was a magnificent scene. One of the research questions of this article is the relationship between the resellers and the merchants in Kyakhta. Furthermore, the Mongols residing between China and Russia also adored Chinese woodblock prints. Prints would be hung in yurts, and during the Chinese New Year every family would paste new year couplets on the door. What was the relationship between merchants in Mongol and the New Year woodblock print workshops in Zhuxian? Riften pointed out that the names of the manufacturing workshops can often be found in the bottom-left corner or other important spots on the prints. The print workshops Tianyide and Tianxingde were two of the important Sino-Mongolia traders. These traders had branches in Beijing, Zhangjiakou, Hohhot, Khovd, Uliastai, and Ulaanbaatar, suggesting intricate trade networks stretching to Mongolia and Russia. This research has utilised the city guide of Beijing and stele records in Kai feng, Zhuxian, Zhokou, Liaocheng, Yanmenguan, Zhangjiakou and Hohhot to investigate the trade routes of Chinese New Year woodblock prints from Yangliuqing and Zhuxian to the Mongolian and Russian borders.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-202003-202003310010-202003310010-111-172,207,2020,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Theoretically, these songbooks were printed by Huiwen Tang from Xiamen because the label ＂Printed by Xiamen Huwen Tang＂ or ＂Published by Xiamen Huiwen Tang＂ is clearly shown on the back cover.

An Analysis of the Inheritance of Zhima Craftsmanship and Conventions,Wang Kun,"inheritance, craftsmanship, zhima, intangible cultural heritage, usage","As a source of folk arts, zhima appeared very early in history. In one of the scenes depicted in Along the River during the Qingming Festival of Northern Song Dynasty, there is a Wang's zhima shop. In the Ming fiction Water Margins, Dai Zong used zhima to make haste on his trip. Zhima embodies Chinese animism. It is a medium between human and nature. It also reflects the Chinese perception of heaven, religion, and belief. That one can invoke deities with zhima perfectly illustrates the integration of universe and humanity in Chinese philosophy. This important spiritual way of life has continued to this date. In Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Hebei provinces, the ancient art of zhima engraving is still a living tradition and the core of local religious life. This study originated from afterthoughts arisen from application for the inclusion of the Chinese Woodblock Prints' in the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanities. Based on actual field investigation in zhima production locations, I analyze the inheritance of traditional folk zhima in different areas, paying special attention to the current handicraftmanship and usage. I discuss how inheritors of various background face circumstances in a time when the concept of intangible cultural heritage becomes more and more prevalent. I also look into Intangible Cultural Heritage candidates that demonstrate strong folklore nature and collectivity, i.e. those that are deeply integrated into daily spiritual and material lives of common people.

The route of his travel was as follows: Vladivostok - Harbin - Shanghai - Ningbo - Putuoshan - Fuzhou - Xiamen - Shantou - Guangzhou - Hong Kong - Saint-Petersburg.

During his earlier studies in China in 1906-1909 Alekseev acquired large collections of ethnographic materials and folk art from the northern regions of China. Therefore, in 1912 he was able to spot interesting facts of social and religious life through professional eye and purchased objects valuable for ethnographic research. This paper focuses on the regional specifics of the objects brought by Alekseev from South China, e.g. paper icons zhima, funeral objects, memorials and prayers used for soul salvation and exorcism rituals, and worship of local deities like Huagong, Huamu and Ziwei Celestial Emperor.

The Structure of God Kinship (Shenqin) and the Transformation of Local Society in Shandong since the Song Dynasty,Ren Yaxuan,"Yan Wenjiang, Song Dynasty, god kinship, local society, Shandong","This paper traces the changing structure of god kinship (shenqin) since the Song Dynasty, and discusses the changes in temple-centric religious organization, in order to outline the process of change in local society. In North China villages, people often relate to the god in kinship terms. Organizing sacrificial activities on the basis of kinship is an important way for villagers to express their rights to participate in the worship of a given god. In the Boshan area just to the east of Taishan in Shandong province, there was a filial woman named Yan Wenjiang living in the state of Qi, and the Yan Temple where she is worshiped is the most important in the area. When the Northern Song Dynasty gave her an official title as ＂Lady of Shunde,＂ the area around Yan Temple came into official view. Changes in population and economic structure in the area after the Yuan-Ming transition led to transformation of religious organization, and the idea of god kinship is one way to understand it. Based on their relationship with Yan Wenjiang, people living around Yan Temple developed two different sacrificing groups, referred to respectively as the husband's mother's family (pojia) and the wife's mother's home (niangjia). Since the revival of the ＂Wenjiang Temple Fair＂ in the 1990s, every year from the end of the fifth to the end of the sixth month there is a one-month ＂return to the wife's mother's home＂ (hui niangjia). This article will focus on how the Yan Temple became the center of a local community from the Northern Song Dynasty on, and will explain how the god kinship structure evolved from the temple as center to the village as center.

I refer to this as a ＂rotating sacrificial network.＂ Such sacrificial networks first appeared in the Song and Yuan when the Hakka were opening the mountain area for agriculture, and it was the product of the interaction of the She and the Han. Even after centuries of social change, rotating sacrificial networks of this kind, which look very much like village alliances, still exist. Especially after the mid-Ming, when lineage ideology gradually spread through village society, the sacrificial networks underwent adaptive changes, but the basic framework and traditional concepts did not change. People continued to circulate the gods from year to year according to traditional rules, and participant lineages remained relatively equal. New content related to social change was simply added to the foundational framework, making it even richer and more varied. The rotating sacrificial network is a mode of organization of the god worship of the rural Hakka of Minxi. By examining this kind of social pattern in the mountain region, we can get a sense of the internal logic of the history of local society's cultural formation by accretion.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201912-201912310009-201912310009-81-114,206,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Baojuan (Precious Scrolls) and Festivals in the Temples of Local Gods in Changshu, Jiangsu",Rostislav Berezkin,"temple festivals, folk literature, storytelling, baojuan (precious scrolls), local deities","Rural areas around Changshu city in Jiangsu preserve strong religious traditions of worship of numerous local tutelary deities which can be traced back to the imperial period. This worship takes the form of festivals at village temples, often coinciding with communal spring celebrations. Baojuan, prosimetric vernacular texts recited by the local professional performers for lay audiences, constitute a common practice of worship of local deities in Changshu. This storytelling is locally known as ＂telling scriptures＂ (jiangjing) and makes a specific cultural tradition of the Changshu area. Baojuan narrating stories of local tutelary deities are often performed at temple festivals, thus making a significant contribution to the variety of ritual and entertainment during these communal events. Though the worship of local deities in southern Jiangsu already has attracted the attention of scholars, there is still little specialized research on modern village temple festivals in Changshu and related narrative literature. This study, based on the author's fieldwork observations and local written sources (preserved in Chinese libraries), attempts to demonstrate the functions of baojuan performances during these temple festivals. They combine ritual function with didactics and entertainment. Though not easy to date, baojuan in Changshu narrate hagiographies of local deities the details of which can be traced to late imperial sources. Today baojuan texts about local tutelary deities constitute an important part of religious culture in Changshu and shed light on the transmission of popular beliefs in the modern period.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201912-201912310009-201912310009-115-175,206,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The Emergence of a Temple-Centric Society,John Lagerwey,"local and regional gods, temple, god titles, popular religion, popular Daoism","While it is now agreed that lineage China, in which villages were organized around ancestor halls, did not really become a prominent part of the landscape, even in South China, before the mid-Ming, far less attention has been paid to the fact these same villages-as well as market towns and county seats-were from the Song on increasingly organized as territory around temples of the popular religion, as opposed to earth god altars or Buddhist and Daoist monasteries. Starting in the Northern Wei, when the state first decreed the creation of such monasteries in every county, monasteries had been the prime religious institutions receiving state funds. But with the takeoff of title granting to popular local gods from the eleventh century on, while monasteries continued to enjoy state support, they increasingly could not compete with the god temples of popular religion. One result was that religious festivals, both in villages and in market towns, came to be organized around the local temples, and involve parades of the gods throughout the territory they protected and policed. Pilgrimages to selected temples, or circulation of gods among networks of villages, also came to be widespread. Another result was the rise to prominence of local gods served by spirit-mediums and of local Buddhists and Daoists who came to be worshiped pretty much like any other local god (Dingguang, Chen Jinggu). Closely linked to these changes are the increasing prominence of popular forms of Buddhism (Pu'an, Yujia, Lingshan) and Daoism (the fashi) that incorporated local gods and even found ways to work directly with spirit-mediums.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201909-201909260010-201909260010-29-102,205,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The importance of Buddhist monastic estates in this period is also emphasized, as are several different paths to the establishment of lineages and ancestral halls. While the Song was a period of extraordinary achievements in Neo-Confucian studies, there were many areas of the Putian plains where this influence was not strongly felt, and where alternative sub-cultures developed around village level shentong (神童) spirit mediums and local temples. And in areas with strong lineages the inscriptional record in the temples indicates that the literati also had important roles in their home village temples, often composing inscriptions, serving on temple management boards, and contributing to restoration campaigns. Thus the scholar literati continued to play important roles in village level worship associations in addition to their ritual activities within their own lineage halls. The article reveals the complexity of the ritual sphere in Putian in the Song, while also briefly tracing some of the subsequent transformations of society and local communal religion in later periods.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201909-201909260010-201909260010-103-159,205,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Rise of Northern Chinese Regional Temple Cults: A Case Study of the Worship of King Tang,Barend J. ter Haar,"Shang dynasty, social organization, King Tang, worship at ponds and springs, rain prayers","One of the cults that arose in the tenth century CE is that for King Tang, the mythological founder of the Shang dynasty. Although several places claimed to have his grave, the new cult did not stem from his grave or any other place that can be reliably associated with the Shang dynasty. Instead his cult was based on a pilgrimage to a pond or lake in the hills of southeastern Shanxi which never ran dry, but most likely did not belong to the historical territory of the Shang. His cult is one of a number of highly prominent northern Chinese cults that are all situated around more or less inexhaustible sources of water. The rise of such cults with a strong local social organization seems to be a substantially new phenomenon of the late tenth century and after. In this article I try to put these and other claims on a more secure footing. First I look briefly at the contemporary observations of the prominent bureaucrat Yuan Haowen 元好問 (1190-1257) on the local cults of his time and his region of provenance, as well as at another prominent northern Chinese cult, that for Lord Guan or Guan Yu.

The Invisible Eternal Mother: Xiantiandao's Changing Religious Networks in Singapore,Chi Chang-hui,"Singapore, reterritorialization, Xiantiandao, Eternal Mother, semiosis","Xiantiandao (The Great Way of Former Heaven) is a syncretic religious sect that emerged during the Qing dynasty. Members of this sectarian religion lived lives of abstinence and vegetarianism. During the Tongzhi reign (1856-1875), after facing persecution in China, Xiantiandao pursued proselytization abroad, rendering a fruitful harvest of converts in Southeast Asia. From Singapore, the Dongchu branch of Xiantiandao established transregional religious networks in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and Hong Kong. The Dongchu branch experienced deterritorialization, the disconnection between a culture and its traditional geographical boundaries, when the branch first arrived in Singapore in the late nineteenth century. Dongchu gradually reconstructed new religious networks and orders in these new areas, initiating prolonged reterritorialization, especially through the establishment of Xiantiandao vegetarian halls for proselytization or for converts' spiritual cultivation. However, since the 1990s, the vegetarian halls of the Dongchu branch has revealed a more confused picture. Some of the relationships within the religious networks were strained and began to break down due to the lack of successors. A few vegetarian halls even converted to Buddhism in the past two decades. Vegetarian halls remaining in the sect's networks maintained a certain religious homogeneity under the Xiantiandao canopy, yet there has been increasing differentiation and difference among them. Despite the fact that these vegetarian halls tried to practice routine religious rituals consistent with much of the Xiantiandao doctrine, their religious practice demonstrated different symbolical meanings. Such religious phenomena can be commonly seen in the emergence of a new dimension of religious secularization. This article deploys the Peircean notion of semiosis, in which signs give rise to new signs, to explain the symbolic processes of religious change within Xiantiandao over the past one hundred years. Over such a long stretch of time, the Eternal Mother, the core religious icon of Xiantiandao, retreated to the background. Abbots, abbesses, or non-Xiantiandao converts who were in charge of vegetarian halls strayed from strict Xiantiandao's doctrine in their preaching. Instead, especially after the 1990s, each of the halls developed its own unique interpretation of Xiantiandao as a way to survive in the rich religious market in Singapore.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201909-201909260010-201909260010-215-264,205,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

There are two versions of dubbing of this puppetry TV series: Japanese and Taiwanese. The Japanese version was dubbed by a professional voice acting crew in Japan, while in the Taiwanese version, the male character's role was solely dubbed by Huang Huifong (1979-), the son of Huang Wenze, aka ＂the eight-tone talent＂ (1956-). The Japanese version was premiered on July 8, 2016 in Japan, and simulcast by two websites, Ba-ha-mu-te donghua fong and iQIYI (Taiwan site) in Taiwan. The Taiwanese version was published and sold in Taiwan from July 13 to September 30, 2016, containing 13 episodes, 23 minutes per episode. This unprecedented crossover puppetry made together by Taiwan and Japan teams was well received by the young audience once it was released. Its high viewership rates had swept away the shadow of Pili's failed box office, The Arti: The Adventure Begins in 2015.

"Commerce, Migration and Local Beliefs in Wangjiangjing District (Northern Zhejiang) since the Song and Yuan Dynasties",Wang Jian,"Jiangnan market towns, local beliefs, Wangjiangjing, commerce, migration","The large-scale development of the Jiangnan 江南 region began during the late Tang and Five Dynasties, including in the Wangjiangjing 王江涇 District of northern Zhejiang. As migration and economic growth proceeded apace, Buddhism and Daoism became increasingly popular in Wangjiangjing, with some families operating Buddhist and Daoist temples as ancestral halls while also reducing their tax burden. At that time, many different types of Buddhist and Daoist sacred sites were scattered throughout the area. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, silk production and trade were thriving, with Wangjiangjing becoming one of Jiangnan's economic centers. As a result, temple cults tended to be concentrated in market towns with high rates of commercial growth. At the same time, however, Buddhism's and Daoism's links to local families weakened over time, yet some Buddhist temples were able to preserve their own traditions. After the Taiping War, Wangjiangjing suffered marked decline, with the western market towns in particular degenerating into countryside, changes that also impacted local beliefs. For example, the ravages of war devastated local demographic structures, which in turn disrupted the foundations of some temple cults. When viewed in this light, the rise of festivals known as Wangchuanhui 網船會 along the eastern bank of the Grand Canal seems particularly striking.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201906-201906240012-201906240012-21-49,204,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Today, the Zhenwu cult remains one of Changshu's most thriving forms of religious life, with a large number of temples dedicated to Zhenwu now flourishing, including those with lengthy histories like the Ancestral Master Temple 祖師廟 on Mount Yushan, the Yousheng Daoist Temple 佑聖道院 at Zhoujing, the Zhenwu Temple 真武廟 at Longxuan, etc. Moreover, birthday celebrations for Zhenwu centered on these temples, as well as ritual activities such as Daoist liturgies and precious scroll recitations, still constitute an important part of Changshu popular culture.

"The Religious and Living Worlds of the Jiangnan Philanthropist Pan Zengyi, with Further References to Lay Buddhism during the Mid-Qing",Shao Jiade,"Jiangnan, Pan Zengyi, Wu County Pan clan, lay Buddhism","The Dafu Pan 大阜潘 family of Wu 吳 County was one of the most prominent lineages in the Jiangnan region during the Qing dynasty, earning renown for its members' success in the civil examination system and their charitable deeds. One leading member of this lineage, Pan Zengyi 潘曾沂, made a wide range of friends and strove to enter the gentry in his early years, but, having failed to pass the jinshi 進士 exams, he ceased working as an official and returned to his hometown, where he became a well-known philanthropist and Buddhist layman. Pan and his clansmen were deeply immersed in Jiangnan's Buddhist networks, and interacted closely with important lay Buddhists of that region like Peng Shaosheng 彭紹升, who was a fellow townsman. This article takes the religious and living worlds of Pan Zengyi as a means of considering the role of Buddhism in both the personal and public lives of Jiangnan literati during the mid-Qing. In addition, based on Pan's ＂absence＂ and ＂presence＂ in these local religious networks, we can also reassess conceptual flaws in constructions of lay Buddhist history. The transformation of the term jushi 居士 into a label caused it to be used in ways that differed from its original meaning, which in turn led to the absence of Pan in some lay Buddhist genealogies. However, Pan's presence was clearly felt in local society and the memories of its inhabitants due to his active participation in Buddhist networks and public affairs. Therefore, the case of Pan Zengyi represents a good example for illustrating the vitality and influence of Buddhism in mid-Qing Jiangnan society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201906-201906240012-201906240012-99-145,204,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Boatmen and Land-based Residents: Two Popular Religious Traditions in the Eastern Lake Tai Basin,Zhu Mingchuan,"statuary, temple systems, temple reconstruction, Eastern Lake Tai Basin, small-boat fishermen","This paper focuses on two forms of religious life in the Eastern Lake Tai Basin. In this area, the practices of small-boat fishermen known as ＂boatmen＂ (chuanshangren 船上人) and land-based residents are quite different due to gaps in the living conditions between these two groups. However, in this part of the Jiangnan 江南 region today, their religious traditions have begun to connect and interact with each other. Based on the study of local temples, this paper discusses the status of fishermen's sacred sites within local temple networks in this region, and analyzes the diverse rites both fishermen and land residents perform in the same temple. Next, the paper explores the reciprocal relations of these two groups' belief systems by scrutinizing the statues and portraits enshrined in their temples, and draws the tentative conclusion that fishermen are learning configurations of statues from land residents' temples, while land residents are beginning to imitate fishermen in terms of building statues for those who die young. In addition, the paper describes how these two groups are taking part in the Eastern Lake Tai Basin's religious revival by participating in the reconstruction and management of temples. The sources used for this paper derive from long-term investigations of several typical temples in the Eastern Tai Lake Basin, combining oral histories, local gazetteers, stele inscriptions and other documents, with the data demonstrating the different roles that fishermen and land-based residents play in preserving their religious traditions while interacting with each other.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201906-201906240012-201906240012-147-195,204,2019,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Such performances occupy a valued place in local communities, and have been recognized by the state as one form of Chinese intangible cultural heritage. In addition, a book entitled Heyang Precious Scroll Collections that was published by the government in 2007 preserves works reflecting local customs and religious life such as the Precious Scroll of Incense Mountain (Xiangshan baojuan 香山寶卷), Precious Scroll on Purgatory (Diyu baojuan 地獄寶卷), and Precious Scroll of the Ten Kings (Shiwang juan 十王卷). Precious scroll recitation performances continue to flourish, with the Precious Scroll of Incense Mountain in particular attracting extensive scholarly attention and numerous findings published in academic circles. However, research about the Precious Scroll on Purgatory is relatively rare, one reason being that it is used in Buddhist mortuary rituals for delivering the deceased to the Pure Land that are held in private family settings during the late evening and midnight hours. Since the most recent field study of these performances was conducted in 1997, this paper presents a full account of one such ceremony that was held in Zhangjiagang in June 2017, and analyses the editions and contents of the precious scrolls used on that occasion.

Next, the article surveys the history of the official guidelines and highlights the significance of the 7th version implemented in 2002, which effectively promoted an expansion of traditional Japanese music practice in junior high school education. With the expectation that students should learn how to play at least one kind of traditional instrument, the guideline made teachers rethink the place of traditional music education as one of their responsibilities.

This is reflected in the development of music education policy before the lifting of martial law in Taiwan. In the 1980s, due to the rising awareness of localization, a range of traditional arts started to be considered as worthy of being preserved, learned, and promoted. Therefore, the question of ＂what is Taiwan's music?＂ has been asked by scholars.

However, the Jintang sect, rich in Taoism, Zen, and Inner Alchemy connotations, was not only the important beginning of the introduction of Inner Alchemy into Taiwan, but influenced the other two sects, Longhua and Xiantian. Jintang sect is very important for an understanding of these two other sects and the spread and development of Inner Alchemy in the popular society of the Ming and Qing dynasties. This article uses document analysis, field surveys, and in-depth interviews to discuss in detail the controversy of the name of Jintang sect and the relationship between Jintang sect and Taoist Inner Alchemy. According to the investigation of this article, ＂Jintang＂ is the original, traditional, and most appropriate name of Jintang sect. The emergence and widespread use of the name ＂Jinchuang,＂ which has been used till today, is actually due to the official intervention of the Japanese colonial government. It is necessary to re-consider the need to continue this name. In terms of practice, Jintang sect is deeply influenced by Zen Buddhism and Taoism, and Inner Alchemy. It also has its unique and new creations. Among them, Inner Alchemy has the deepest influence. Therefore, Jintang sect is a sect which practices Buddhism and Taoism teachings, and especially Inner Alchemy.

However, only very few are capable of writing up new plays using the scenario outline called tâi-sòo. Chen Meiying is a female lead specializing in tragic roles, who also doubles as a play narrator of gezixi troupes, Xinfengzhu and Sijichun in Singapore. Originally from the famous troupe Xinsaifeng in Singapore, she once served as the leading female role of the famous Malaysian troupe Qilin. Her performance credentials stride over both Singapore and Malaysia. Often, at the request of the troupe owners, she would compose new plays. Currently, the existing number of scenario outlines attributed to her amount to 19 plays. In this study, I start with the development of Ms. Chen Meiying's expertise in composing scenario outlines, her motivation, preference of subjects, and her approaches and techniques. I analyze how, just like many folk playwrights, Chen Meiying integrated her own life experience with the nourishment she assimilated from local culture to enhance the content of gezixi theatre one step at a time. I also examine how, as a female playwright and actress in Singapore, she used scenario outlines which exhibit characteristics that are different from those of the gezixi theatre in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201812-201812280009-201812280009-59-131,202,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Southern Qi and Northern Ma, a Case Study of Commercial Competition as a Strategy of Theatrical Performance in the Golden Period of Peking Opera, 1917-1938",Lee Tien-yin,"Qilintong (Zhou Xinfang), performance art, Peking Opera, Ma Lianliang","Qilintong (Zhou Xinfang) and Ma Lianliang were leading senior male roles in the golden period of Peking opera. They both specialized in characters that required virtuoso singing and performing. The repertoire and characters they mastered considerably overlapped. Many times did they appear in the same play and on the same stage. I will use play reviews, theatre houses' advertisements of the 1920s, the actors' autobiographical accounts, memories of theatregoers and research articles to reconstruct the competitive atmosphere between Peking Opera commercial theatres and the circumstance that impelled the actors to formulate their own artistic styles. The case studied in the first section of this article is their same-stage competition in Tianchan Theatre, Shanghai in 1927. I will compare their repertoire arrangement, explore the strategies they used to win over audience, and analyze how their strategies reveal the trend of Shanghai theatre. In the second section, I discuss how certain plays, stimulated by commercial theatres' competition, and polished repeatedly by Qi and Ma, became famous plays of their respective schools. There are even plays such as Four Scholars and Breeze Pavilion that are considered representative repertoire of them both. I will analyze in detail how the two actors used their different performance styles to interpret the same character, how the audience welcomed the result, and how they remained active on stage during the golden period of Peking Opera and became masters of the senior male role.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201812-201812280009-201812280009-133-179,202,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
In Search of Hometown Accent Abroad: Investigation of Hokkien Ballads and Their Local Memory in Penang,Huang Wen-chu,"local memory, ballad, hometown accent, Hokkien, Penang","The investigation and research of Southern Fujian (Hokkien) ballads is an important segment of folk literature and/or Southern Fujian culture. When we shift the research field to Singapore and Malaysia, we can, through studying the transmission and variation, conduct a comparative research on the Hokkien Ballads. Furthermore, when we take the Hokkien Ballads as a vehicle or text, then, through the migration of ballads, we can observe how folk literature or popular culture manages to pass on the tradition and localize its development in the changing process of time and space. Through the investigation and compilation of Hokkien Ballads in Penang, we find the Hokkien nursery rhymes, Baba (峇峇) Hokkien Ballads and songs from traditional Fujian opera still active there. These are ancient tunes from their native hometown Fujian. However, after the local Chinese society saw their third generation, the phenomenon of ＂anti-diaspora＂ and ＂modern diaspora＂ arose. When the Chinese communities in Penang began to integrate into local culture and language, ancient tunes also faced a ＂dialect-localization.＂ Due to displaced time and space as well as multicultural integration in Singapore and Malaysia, the Hokkien ballads and modern Hokkien songs developed a ＂Nanyang accent＂ that, while demonstrating local characteristics and elements of entertainment, is still reminiscent of ancestral cultural memories.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201812-201812280009-201812280009-181-219,202,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

I firstly review the notion of heritage and its correspondent development with the expansion of Western modernity and the global system, to reveal how heritage has been defined, debated, legitimized, institutionalized and provided with the politics of cultural identity internationally and domestically. I then review Japanese regulations of Cultural Assets to discuss how, by adopting paradigm of knowledge such as the Japanese folklore study, the nation has developed, refined and revised the system as an inscription of, and reaction to, modernization. The discussion is then followed by the example of my long-term ethnographic study of ritual and performances in Taketomi, to illustrate how regional cultural practices interact with the global discourse and national craft centering on intangible cultural heritage, while expressing themselves with unique cultural philosophy about the past. At the end, I suggest that the transformation of the premise and core value of intangible cultural heritage, as shown in the difference between the 1972 and 2003 Conventions, prove that the community, which is the ideal maintainers of cultural heritage, must negotiate and even transform the concepts and discourse, to sustain a more autonomous space for interpretation and creation, while ensuring the recognition of uniqueness of its own culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201809-201809040005-201809040005-25-63,201,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

In Hong Kong, the festival embodies functions of religion, social networking and reinforcement of ethnic identity. Besides rituals of spiritual redemption, praying for peacefulness, and ancestral worship, the festival is also an important venue for ethnic groups to integrate and at the same time establish their own social identity. In 2011, the Yulan Ghost Festival of Ethnic Chaozhou in Hong Kong was registered on the list of the Third National Intangible Cultural Heritage. The Federation of Hong Kong Chiu Chow (Chaozhou) Community Organizations, being the designated conservation organization, has been actively promoting the Yulan Cultural Festival in order to enhance ethnic identity and solidarity of local and overseas Chaozhou Chinese.

Deities Reside Within: Negotiation of the Spatial Concept in the Summon Ritual Script of the Rural Jiao in South Zhejiang,"Qu Xiaoyu, Peng Liansheng","district/settlement, True Official of This Land and District, the three heavens, spatial concept, Xiangtongguan","This article is a case study of the Xiangtongguan, a Daoist jiao ritual script prevalent in southeast Zhejiang. I discuss the dual-spatial concept between the Daoist scriptures and local pantheon and how the concept influenced the inception of ritual texts. The core feature of Xiangtongguan is its Daoist cosmology of jiao ritual. It contains on the one hand a specific geographic area, which I called ＂the local,＂ that reflects the distribution of local temples and deities; on the other hand a dual structure of ritual placement constituted by ＂the local＂ and the ＂three heavens.＂ Based on analysis of changes occurring in stages of jiao ritual placement and relations of ritual characters found in manuscripts collected from five kinds of ＂Masters,＂ I conclude that the morphological characteristics of the Xiangtongguan text was a result of the negotiation between perspectives of ＂the local＂ and ＂the three heavens.＂ Editors of the scriptures employ the ＂district/settlement＂ framework as a guideline to select and integrate the ritual content. This process of choice and integration is closely related with the concept of ＂True Official of This Land and District＂ of the Daoist tradition and temple worship of folk religion. The territorial, intermediary and space-conversional characteristics of ＂True Official of This Land and District＂ enabled the heterogeneous spatial concepts between the Daoist scriptures and folk religion practices to negotiate during the conversion and expansion of ＂order/ disorder.＂ Eventually, they propel the forming of a ritual text with dual spatial spheres. It is with this kind of ritual texts that local Daoist ritualists maintain a balance between elite religious knowledge and local ritual experience, and become crucial members of the local social-religious ecosystem.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201809-201809040005-201809040005-101-167,201,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Because he died when he was only 61 years old, his songs are much more well known than his name. But, as a musician, he devoted himself not only to pop song writing but to the collecting of Taiwanese folk songs. After his return to Taiwan from Japan in 1946, he travelled all over Taiwan to collect folk songs through his own effort. He also closely worked with a dancing group for tourists, ＂Ching-liu Garden,＂ in Wulai. With his hidden status, hardly anyone realized his superb contribution in his folk song collecting in the past few decades. His Symphonic Folk Songs of Taiwan premiered in 1964, had been arranged with traditional Taiwanese and Western music instruments. In this symphony, there are many Taiwanese folk songs melodies which are well assimilated in the whole work. It is the musical realization of Mr. Hsu's effort in this folk song collecting. In this paper, I'm focusing on the folk songs in Symphonic Folk Songs of Taiwan. Firstly, I study Mr. Hsu's point of view about folk songs and their collecting method. Secondly, thanks to Mr. Hsu's family who provided me with a great amount of Mr. Hsu's original materials, I am able to trace Mr. Hsu's periodical concerts, his publication of the related song books, and the series of recordings of his own folk song arrangements. The study of these activities in Mr. Hsu's career will lead us to the paths that Mr. Hsu had taken in collecting folk songs.

This paper further explores the multiple meanings of the image of Mother Mary for the Amis Catholics. Especially, I observe how the urban Amis form their ethnic identity and create their living spaces through the beliefs and practices of Catholicism.

"A Survey of Taimu Cult and Ritual Art in Shangfang Mountain, Suzhou",Chen Yongchao,"ritual art, Wutong, Taimu, the Shangfang mountain","The prevailing viewpoint of the origin of Wutong cult (Wuxian cult included) is that it stemmed from the Wuyuan area and then spread throughout various places in southern China. Among these places, the northern part of the Wu dialect region centering around Taihu Basin is particularly notable. While the region has absorbed this cult since the Ming dynasty, some distinct features have also been developed there. For one thing, people have created a deity, ＂Taimu, the Mother of Wutong,＂ and endowed her with a higher status and more power than Wutong; for another, the Shangfang mountain in suburban Suzhou has been regarded as a shrine of ＂Taimu＂ and ＂Wutong,＂ the radius of which covers the entire Taihu Basin.

Though tickets were extremely expensive, the box office sale went well. With a diachronic perspective, this study examines documents ranging from newspapers, periodicals, and diaries to sort out Tenkatsu Troupe's performance history and analyze its performing environments and audiences. In addition to retaining part of the traditional Japanese magic, Tenkatsu Troupe also integrated many elements from Western popular culture, such as jazz music and acrobatics, presenting an internationalized program. They also developed several magic dramas, with closely knitted magic sessions. They gave most of their performances in large or medium theatres, providing opportunities for members of many Japanese townsmen associations, companies and governmental offices to mingle and socialize. While special discount tickets were offered to students, only people with a decent income could afford to attend the show. With the growth of economy, the percentage of Taiwanese audience increased. The frequent visits of Tenkatsu Troupe demonstrate that Taiwan had become an important stop for their tour around East Asia. However, as the political situation in East Asia worsened, the first-generation Tenkatsu announced her retirement in 1934, giving her baton to the second-generation Tenkatsu.

The commercial puppet theatre of the Japanese Colonial era started in temple courtyards and/or tea plantations. Some initiated a ticketing system following the example of a theatre house while others even staged their performances inside a modern theatre. It is the purpose of this study to determine if the commercial puppet theatre in post-war Taiwan had continued with certain old mechanism and developed certain theatrical characteristics. The flourishing commercial puppet theatre of post-war Taiwan was a spontaneous cultural phenomenon, not funded by any governmental cultural offices. How does it differ from the theatre accompanying the thanksgiving ritual? How did professional puppet theatre troupes merge with theatre entrepreneurs? How did they develop a self-financing management, becoming a spotlight with a huge audience, and creating a spontaneous competition among themselves? I will assume a folk artist's perspective and consider the commercial mechanism between troupes and theatres. Using the folk knowledge of ＂pa' k-hi＂ to penetrate the meanings behind the historical data of commercial theatre, I will then employ the sociological concept of Pierre Bourdieu to investigate the symbolic capital puppet theatre generated once it entered the champ of modern theatre. Most important of all, did the troupes realize that they had to make certain distinctions in strategy when they encountered a different type of champ?

Between 1865 and 1870, three new commercial theatres were established within six years, reflecting the rapid growth of local demand of entertainment and the flourishing of Chinese/Cantonese opera industry. Such demographic and economic changes in the second half of the 19th century were brought about by two major historical events: Taiping Movement (1850-1864) in China, and the discovery of gold mines in North America and later in Australia. The arrival of new migrants, finance, business, and job opportunities to Hong Kong were the social and economic forces leading to the prosperity of the commercial theatre business. Containing three main sections, this paper narrates the social history of commercial theatres of late Qing Hong Kong in a concentric way: the socio-economic environments outside the theatres, the social origins and behaviors of audience in the commercial theatres, and the operatic performances and genres exhibited on the stage. A central issue is how the economic boom of Hong Kong in the ＂era of the Pacific＂ reshaped the operatic landscape of the Colony, bringing about the emergence of a new urban market of Chinese/Cantonese opera other than Canton in southern Guangdong.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201803-201803220010-201803220010-177-211,199,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Despite the fact that most of the population of Hong Kong are Chinese people who share a common ethnicity, the cultural and political development of Hong Kong is substantially different from that of Mainland China, and so are their Chinese opera productions. Population flow, town planning policy, diasporic consciousness, and freedom of creativity are closely associated with the creation of experimental Cantonese operas in the 1950s. This paper focuses on the impact of colonial modernity on the urban development of Hong Kong from the early 1950s, and the various cultural influences brought from the cosmopolitan Shanghai, Guangzhou, Japan, as well as the Western film and culture available under the British colonial rule. Following the modernisation of this little colony, the local Cantonese opera productions created at the time could be categorised as ＂restoring＂ old practice of the 1920s and 1930s and ＂enhancing＂ the existing repertoire and performance practice, which in turn vividly demonstrates the hybrid identity of Hong Kong.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201803-201803220010-201803220010-213-262,199,2018,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

It will modify the scholarly opinions about the famous literati Fang Chengpei's edition, and try to propose a new way of looking at the development of the white snake drama in mid-Qing. Firstly, this paper has some things new to offer: a re-examination of the adaptation by Chen Jiayan (an actor) and his daughter, the finding of a note on the performance by the new troupe from the royal court in Beijing, and the discovery of some rare manuscripts of the full play or excerpts. New materials help us to rectify the concrete time-line of the transformation and transmission of Thunder Peak Pagoda. Secondly, this paper gives a detailed analysis of six excerpts of Thunder Peak Pagoda, which explains the interaction between the literati's edition and actors' revisions. The actors' transmissions have their own inherited system, which means Fang's revision did not necessarily play a crucial role. Lastly, the ＂formulation＂ of Thunder Peak Pagoda was likely to take place in 1780, when Qianlong Emperor went southward to Yangzhou, and the salt merchants assembled dozens of mingliu (famous masters of arts and literature) to revise the play to be performed in the front of the Emperor. Therefore, the development of white snake drama could be divided into three stages: 1) 1738-1768, the transformation of its plots and characters; 2) 1770-1780, the core period which marks its gradual maturity; 3) 1780, which indicates the formulation of actors' version, causing its popularity in the theatre and court.

These Chinese people spread Chinese culture to every corner of the world by settling down in other lands and establishing centralized or dispersed communities. Taiwan, with its unique historical background, happened to be one of the most significant destinations. As the study of Chinese culture should not neglect the legacy passed down by the overseas Chinese, the study of Taiwanese folk opera (or gezaixi) should not leave out its dissemination and development abroad, especially in Fujian of Mainland China, Singapore, and Malaysia. So far, xiāng jù (a type of gezaixi which is commonly performed in Fujian) has gained much scholarly attention. Over the past few years, ＂Fujian opera＂ (also known as 'performed gezaixi'), popular with a specific audience in Singapore and Malaysia, has also come into the spotlight in academia. However, most of the research findings focus on the development of gezaixi in Singapore. Malaysia has not been given its due attention. As they do in Singapore, professional gezaixi troupes in Malaysia inherited the way of performing originating in Taiwan, namely tsò-uàh-hì (做活戲), also known as ＂extemporaneous performance.＂ This paper will start from reviewing the background of gezaixi's development in Malaysia and the current research on this topic. It will then focus on Kî-lîn (麒麟) Professional Hoklo (Min) Opera Troupe, the most important and long-existing troupe in Malaysia, to explore the recent challenges faced by local professional gezaixi troupes, their performance, and operational strategies. Thanks to an internal document of Kî-lîn, we can see how these troupes creatively enriched their ＂repertoire＂ of frequently performed works by integrating diversified cultures in Malaysia and internalizing various ways of performing. Lastly, to demonstrate the operational strategies of the Malaysia-based troupes, a collaborative performance by Ki-lin Professional Hoklo Opera Troupe and Taiwanese gezaixi artists will be taken as an example. This example will show how they benefit from and resist the popular culture and entertainment trends to compete with ＂singing-stage＂ (歌臺) performance, xiāng jù of China, and the Teochew opera troupes in Thailand. Every strategy they adopt and decision they make not only reflect the environments in which the professional gazaixi troupes struggle to survive, but also form a new ＂tradition＂ through integration of diversified cultures.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201712-201712290009-201712290009-63-126,198,2017,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Polyphonic Melodies: The Classification and Development of Beigang Amateur Musical Troupes during the Japanese Colonial Era,Li Meng-hsun,"Beigang, western music, lâm-kuán, pak-kuán, tsú-tē troupes","Beigang had been a busy port town since the seventeenth century. The popularity of the Mazu Temple and active amateur musical troupes (tsú-tē troupes) both added to the prosperity of the town. Musical troupes in Beigang include lâm-kuán, pak-kuán, sip-sam-khiang, Beijing Opera, káu-kah-á-hì, kua-á-hì, and western music. In this paper, I discuss the classification and development of amateur musical troupes in the Japanese Colonial Era. During the Japanese Colonial Era, the types and number of tsú-tē troupes both increased, integrating tradition and modernity. In the annual Mazu procession of Chaotian Temple, the tsú-tē troupes fell into ＂South,＂ ＂North,＂ and ＂West＂ groups according to their respective styles and positions in the social order.

Heritage as Spatial-Temporal Theatre: Comparative Research on the Representation of Historic Ruins in Rome and Xi'an,Hsueh Meng-chi,"representation strategy, performing cultural heritage, heritage as theatre, visitability","This research delves into the representation designs of historic ruins in Rome and Xi'an from a comparative perspective. Italian capital Rome and Chinese Xi'an are both ancient metropolises that possess more than two-thousand-year urban histories and therefore there are abundant ancient relics worthy of conservation. Historic ruins in Rome are prone to be layered vertically underground while heritage sites in Xi'an are horizontally widespread and bound to be displayed in the open fields. It has been widely accepted that ＂visitability＂ and visual legibility should be created in order to convey meanings and values of heritage sites to the public. It is especially true to those seriously ruined heritage sites which are less perceptible and intelligible by nature. Virtual reconstruction and multimedia projection techniques seem to be a feasible ways to enhance on-site heritage interpretation, contribute to the sensory representation of the archeological heritage sites, and furthermore provoke visitors' emotion. Then, how were such techniques utilized differently due to the uniqueness of heritage sites in Rome and Xi'an, namely vertically superimposed and horizontally interspersed? Based on empirical studies, this article scrutinizes their differences in mentality, motivation, and practice of employing virtually reconstructive projection designs. This article also points out the ideological shift from displaying to performing cultural heritage which represents heritage sites as spatial-temporal theatres that narrate stories. By projecting imagery on the ruined environment, the Roman design team temporarily got rid of the disturbance of the superimposed and entangled later additions to the ruins while the Xi'an design team rendered imaginative historical atmosphere or reserved the extensive emptiness deliberately. Besides considering heritage sites as tangible storytelling theatres, this article also borrows the mirror-like configuration of theatrical stage metaphorically for reflexive thinking. By looking into the backstage performance, this article analyzes how the protagonists respectively constructed, manipulated, and used the ideology of collective ownership and sponsorship regarding the archaeological discovery, conservation, and representation of the heritage sites.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201712-201712290009-201712290009-165-218,198,2017,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Commoner's Philosophy of Jieqi, the 24 Solar Terms",Yang Yujun,"festival, time perception, proverb, solar terms, solar term deities","The jieqi solar terms are determined by the relative degree of angles formed between the sun and earth during a calendar year. The measuring of each term could be somewhat challenging for commoners. Therefore, general public perceive jieqi through sayings and folklore of seasonal ecological and climate changes. Although the corresponding folklore vary according to natural phenomena of respective areas, there is an underlying philosophy that remains very similar. In this study, I browse through the agricultural sayings to deduce the characters of jieqi in general public's perception. There are fundamental differences between jieqi and festivals, although the two do overlap in terms of time and character. I contrast jieqi and festivals to show their divergence of nature and humanity. In addition, I examine the pictures of jieqi deities featured in some temples of southern Taiwan. Analysis of their images help reveal another aspect of the painter's perception of jieqi. Finally, in daily diction, jieqi not only refers to the solar terms but also a time philosophy, coordinates between farming and climate which has been well recognized by the farmers, actual expressions and sentences regarding jieqi will be used to illustrate this philosophy of ＂timing.＂",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201712-201712290009-201712290009-219-262,198,2017,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Shepherd,"household registers, variolation, vaccination, smallpox","That smallpox was a leading cause of death in China in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is widely accepted, but this has rarely been documented quantitatively. Instead the prevalence of smallpox is inferred from scattered reports of epidemics, impressionistic reports of the numbers pockmarked by the disease, and from reports of efforts to staunch the disease through variolation and vaccination. Nor has the extent of vaccination in the population of late nineteenth century China ever been assessed quantitatively.

Giving children their mothers' surnames was a custom of uxorilocal marriage. However, not all children of uxorilocal marriage took their mothers' surnames. We therefore are interested in learning how uxorilocal marriage couple surname their children, and what factors would affect the surnaming behaviors. This research will rely on ＂Taiwan Historical Household Registers Database, 1906-1945＂ to study children of 714 uxorilocal couples in 4 Hakka settlements in Xinzhu. The results show that, first, the patterns of surnaming children vary across time and space. Second, birth order and sex of children were associated with the likelihood of taking mothers' surnames. The likelihood of giving children mother's surname de creased with later birth order. A male offspring was more likely to take his mother's surname than his female counterpart. Third, giving children their mothers' surnames may be necessary to maintain the family lineage and/or to guarantee family labor force in the future. We found that the first-born boys were more likely to take mother's last name than girls. When the women of uxorilocal marriage had brothers, the likelihood of their first-born children taking their surnames was low. When the first child was a girl and the second child was a boy, the likelihood of the boy taking mother's last name was high.

However, in the Hoklo areas close to the Hakka areas, the custom of foot binding were not as popular as other Hoklo areas. Ethnic assimilation can only partially explain this phenomenon. Household registers data shows that Hoklo female with cross-ethnic family background were more likely to get rid of foot binding. However, the Hoklo women without such background in the Hoklo- Hakka frontiers were also easier to get rid of foot binding than who in other Hoklo areas. This article points out that foot binding was like the ＂arms race.＂ The more the popularity of foot binding in the surroundings, the more the likelihood the parents bind their daughters' feet, to avoid getting a disadvantage in the marriage market. Conversely, the existence of a lot people who do not pursue the lotus feet in the surroundings drastically reduced the pressure of pursuing foot binding.

But we find today they've replaced it with that of the place where they have lived if we visit the cemeteries around Taiwan. This seems to indicate the increasing localization of Taiwan society. When did the trend of ＂the localization of ancestral homeland identity＂ start, how universal it was, and what was the main factor which brought about this phenomenon? This article suggests that the phenomenon began during the Japanese occupation and have been going on since then.

Using songs and dances of 'Atolan Amis, I explore the differences between the legalization of cultural heritage and self-cognition in Taiwanese indigenous communities. The 'Atolan Amis' cultural revitalization movement started in 1995. Since then, songs and dances have become the youth's first encounter with tradition. They also play a prominent role in the age organization. Either when participating in internal community affairs (such as kiloma'an) or challenging the power of the nation (when fighting to regain sovereignty of traditional territory), the songs and dances of 'Atolan Amis adhere to their community's conception, revealing a cognition different from that in the Cultural Heritage legalization system. Songs and dances are not only a medium with which the 'Atolan Amis voices their sentiments, they also demonstrate their own culture essence and subjectivity. I have witnessed the significance and creativity of 'Atolan Amis' songs and dances both within the community and in external social public affairs. After examining them according to the logic of cultural heritage classification and criteria of by-laws in Taiwan and UNESCO, I point out the discrepancy between the legalization system of assigned and registered cultural heritage and that of actual practices among the indigenous people.

The process of the Jinmen City God Folk Festival's obtaining a government-certified status of Important Folklore allows us to reflect on the national cultural policy's goal of protection of folklore as an intangible cultural heritage, or national culture property.

Discussion and Reflection on Zhuang Staged Moedlaenz Performance in Guangxi under Policies regarding Intangible Cultural Heritage in China,Kao Ya-ning,"performance, intangible cultural heritage, Zhuang people, moedlaenz, ritual specialist","This paper discusses and reflects on the process and opportunity of staging moedlaenz performance among the Zhuang people in southwest Guangxi in the context of practicing policies regarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH). I suggest that in the early 21st century both the wider social context of these performances and their inner cultural origin direct Zhuang people to stage moedlaenz songs by mimicking ritual specialists. In the context of the widespread and enthusiastic practicing of ICH policies in China, moedlaenz singers are allowed to dress up in the clothes of ＂practitioners of superstition＂ and carry ritual instruments as stage props to perform their Zhuang culture. The staging of moedlaenz performance is a typical case of de-contextualization and re-contextualization. Between late Qing and early Republic era, local literati adopted Han Chinese stories to create moedlaenz songs and folk singers sang them while traveling from village to village. Since 1949, moedlaenz has been classified as a form of Zhuang folk art (quyi) under the People's Republic of China (PRC), and cultural troupe performers have sung moedlaenz songs praising the Chinese Communist Party's policies on stage as a form of propaganda. In the 1980's, Chinese academic circles researching folk arts and culture conducted large-scale surveys to record moedlaenz songs. In 2010, the moedlaenz was formally identified as an item on Guangxi's provincial ICH list. The head of Ande township culture station in Jingxi wrote a moed laenz song entitled ＂Baomu'en＂ (Sending Thanks to Mother) and trained local women to sing this song in 2011. A local composer who had retired from the You River Song and Dance Troupe, inspired by ritual specialist's costume and instruments, designed specific stage costumes and props to accompany the performance of this song. Since 2012, a group of local female performers, dressed in stage costumes and carrying props, have been performing the song ＂Baomu'en＂ in invented festivals in both towns and cities across southwest Guangxi. Although performances of staged moedlaenz songs utilize the costumes, instruments and settings of ritual specialist, whether or not practitioners of ICH policies treasure ritual specialist's oral ritual knowledge and their impromptu spirit is not clear. I expect that the spirit of ritual song will continue to enrich moedlaenz song performance and that local song experts, policy makers, practitioners and researchers will need to cooperate toward the goal of protection and inheritance of moedlaenz as a whole.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201706-201707270002-201707270002-147-217,196,2017,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The traditional paintings in architecture have their root in Chinese calligraphy and paintings. However, during times of changes, new visual culture also comes into play. Traditional and modern styles of paintings co-exist in a residential space, creating a novel way of artistic representation. This particular phenomenon, born out of the distinct social and historical environments not only reflects the social background and trends of fashion, but also reveals the taste of common people. In this article, I study the paintings in residential buildings during 1920 to 1930, using both field research and related documents. I analyze the theme and content of paintings of this period through the background of painting craftsmen and elements of the mainstream art development. The objectives of my research include, (1) to investigate how such modern themes and content of residential house paintings relate to the social background; (2) to document life stories and professional experiences of these painters; (3) to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the inception of modern images and the painters. I conclude that the arrival of trendy modern images indicates that politics and economic development of the society, as well as the mainstream arts style did have a significant impact on the traditional architectural paintings. Yet, individual artist's influence relates more to his own experience of apprenticeship. This study unveils new aspects of traditional architectural paintings during the Japanese Colonial Period.

"Operas, Rituals and Cultural Traditions: The Cult of the ＂Three Kings＂ in Modern Guangxi",Huang Yu,"Three Sacrifices Ceremony, operatic performances, cultural mediation, Three Kings cult, cultural traditions","This paper treats birthday rituals and operatic performances staged for gods known as the Three Kings (Sanwang 三王) in northern Guangxi villages during the late Qing and Republican periods. The paper's goal is to explore the mediating roles of these events during the interaction between imperial rituals and indigenous cultural traditions. After the Guzhou Man 古州蠻 of Wangjiang 王江 submitted to the rule of the Northern Song Dynasty, the Three Kings were granted imperial titles and became a vital symbol of the alliance between state authority and local power. The imperial state further consolidated its rule following the Huaiyuan Yao Rebellion 懷遠猺亂 of the sixteenth century and the dredging of the Duliu River 都柳江 during the eighteenth century, with education and the local economy becoming increasingly developed. This time period witnessed the appearance of a native lower gentry, which emerged in large numbers in Heli 和里 and Nanzhai 南寨. These elites worked to reconstruct ritual and dramatic traditions for the Three Kings, introducing state-sanctioned rites such as the Three Sacrifices Ceremony (Sanxianli 三獻禮) into the villages that worshipped these deities. This paper assesses the impact of such imperial ceremonies on village life, especially how they blended with local operatic performances in new ritual forms. There is also data on performances of local songs and the indigenization of outside dramatic traditions, all of which contributed to the long-term development of village culture. Finally, the paper's conclusion discusses the function of rituals and opera performances as forms of cultural mediation that helped shape the interaction between the imperial state and local communities.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201703-201704190015-201704190015-25-78,195,2017,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

From Secret Society Covenant to Oath of Office: An Aspect of Modern Chinese Oath Culture,Hu Hsueh-chen,"cult of Sun Yat-sen, secret society, revolutionary group, oath culture, oath-taking system","The development of modern Chinese oath culture can be traced from the Revive China Society (Xingzhonghui 興中會) to the Republic of China government in postwar Taiwan. This was the result of a synthesis of modern political thought and oath-taking systems as well as ritual elements of Christianity and Chinese secret societies. Following the establishment of the ROC, the religious facets of modern oath culture gradually declined due to the formation of modern political parties and the nation-state, with only residual traces of Christian and secret society practices remaining, yet the advent of the cult of Sun Yatsen allowed for the presence of some lingering religious elements. In terms of the transformation of modern Chinese oaths, it is possible to identify two specific phenomena. The first was that the beings charged with witnessing oaths changed from divine to human; the second was how such oaths were dated, a result of the introduction of a new calendar after the ROC's founding. There are two other special features of modern oath culture: the emphasis on the adverse consequences of oath-breaking and the raising of the right hand during the ritual. However, people do not always follow the rules when taking an oath, and such rites do not always exert a strong restraining force on the oath-taker. The paper concludes by stressing that the development of modern Chinese oath culture was not the result of one unilateral process but instead featured interaction between many different elements.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201703-201704190015-201704190015-207-246,195,2017,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Power, Imagination and Representation: The Impact of Photography on Modern Chinese Religious Groups",Fan Chun-wu,"Morality Studies Society, Xuyun, photography, Duan Zhengyuan, Zhao Bichen","The appearance of photography in 1839 enabled not only the duplication of the physical world but also new technological forms of recording human memories. In the case of modern China, the introduction of photographic techniques exerted a profound influence on many dimensions of social life, including religion. For many religious groups, the ability to produce large numbers of photographic images that were said to exhibit miraculous powers proved an invaluable tool for spreading their beliefs and practices. Accordingly, since the early years of the Republic of China, famous religious leaders like the Daoist Zhao Bichen 趙避塵used photos to demonstrate the transmission of their teachings. Buddhism also took full advantage of photography as a means of advertising, especially many renowned Buddhist masters. One example involves Xuyun 虛雲, famous for his Chan practice and longevity, who in 1920 dedicated considerable effort creating a photographic chronicle of his life at the Yunxi Monastey (Yunxi si 雲栖寺) in Kunming. Another instance featured Duan Zhengyuan 段正元 of the Moral Studies Society (Daode xueshe 道德學社), who utilized photography to present stages of his life, while also stipulating that believers worship photos of him on the first and fifteenth days of each lunar month or during specific rituals as a means of enhancing their self-cultivation practices.

Mu Dan Gui Min Theater Troupe's Performances in Singapore in the 1960s,Tsai Hsin-hsin,"Singapore, Taiwan traditional opera, 1960s, vinyl records, Mu Dan Gui Min Theater Troupe","After the Pacific War, the Taiwanese kua-a opera resumed its commercial performances in Southeast Asia. Mu Dan Gui Min Theater Troupe, because many of its members were famous actors and actresses, became a theater troupe that figured most prominently in the history of Taiwanese opera. It was founded in 1964 by Chen Feishan and Huang Xi. Their basic members were enlisted from the Zhonghua Xing Theater Troupe of Tainan, and additional eleven ones from the North. Upon examining the inter-personal relations between members of Mu Dan Gui, New Taiguang (1962), and Baihua (1964) Min Theater Troupes, one may detect a certain network that will help us explore the troupe-hiring mechanism and patterns of troupe members' composition in Singapore and Malaysia. In this study, I employ the ＂triple evidence＂ strategy. By integrating evidences from newspaper archives and journal articles, actual objects such as photos, vinyl records, and theater bills, field investigation, and oral history interview records, I sort out the history of the mechanism of Taiwanese kua-a opera troupes' overseas performances, composition of the troupe members, the theater environment, genres of opera, and vinyl recordings in Singapore.

Generally speaking, the repertoire of these three zheng schools overlap. In terms of their stylistic features, Minnan zheng music is mainly characterized by its clarity. Hakka zheng music is often interpreted as classic and elegant. Chaozhou zheng music is well-known for its embellishments and refined subtlety. The stylistic features of the three zheng schools are inferred from their unique performing skills as well as characteristic musical vocabularies. This article aims to investigate three versions of ＂Lotus＂ from Minnan, Hakka, and Chaozhou zheng music in an attempt to discuss the similarities and diversities based on the geo-relations and the melodic contours. The study indicates the fact that the special geo-relation of South Fujian and East Guangdong helped form distinct melodic contours in this area. The performance techniques, especially the sliding and pressing techniques of left hand fingers, is the most decisive factor in determining the stylistic features of the three zheng schools. Due to the similar geo-relational circumstances of this area and the cultural interactions between ethnic groups, there had been sufficient integration between repertoires of zheng music. On the other hand, different linguistic background and customs brought about distinct instrumental details and aesthetics. Ultimately, there exists both similarity and diversity of the melodic contours among Minnan, Hakka, and Chaozhou zheng Music.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201612-201701090006-201701090006-53-112,194,2016,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The first part focuses on the Hakka international conferences held in Taiwan in order to understand when and how the scholars in Taiwan developed interest in the Hakka communities in Southeast Asia. In the second part, the article look through literature (including the book, book chapters, journal articles, conference papers, and dissertations) on Southeast Asian Hakka studies. By examining their approaches, methodology, and most importantly, the issues of interest, the discussion aims to represent the characteristics of Southeast Asian Hakka studies in Taiwan.

Approaches to Understanding Intercultural Performances: Intersubjectivity and Multi-sited Ethnographic Research on a Taiwan's Burmese Music Performance,Tasaw Hsin-Chun Lu,"multisubjectivity, intersubjectivity, Burmese music, intercultural performance, multi-sited ethnography","Intercultural exchange of performing arts is booming today. Drawing scholarly attention to intercultural performance, ethnomusicologists have long grappled with the intricate powerful relationships occurring in the transcultural frameworks through the (de)construction and (re)shaping of the ＂diaspora＂ idea. In that, intercultural arts performance has proven to have great potential in revealing the dynamic interplays between different social agents and representing cultural ideologies. It can also provide a platform for social transformation. However, early discourses on intercultural arts performance centered more on the performance itself as referred to the texts for analysis. Oftentimes those underlying substances and values embedded within the performance remain uncovered. This article introduces and conceptualizes two approaches to the study of intercultural music performance, including intersubjectivity and multi-sited ethnography. With a focus on the performance produced by Taiwan's National Theater and Concert Hall titled ＂Sounding Diaspora: Kyaw Kyaw Naing,＂ it adopts these two approaches to the exploration of the dynamic interplays within. In the analysis, I suggest that one can expand ＂the site of research＂ from a single location to multiple ones and trace the trajectories in the creative process of the performance production. Constructing the relationality, or connectivity between these locations such as trains, threads, conjunctions, or paths, will help us understand the intricate cultural politics and ideologies deployed in music performance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201609-201610270016-201610270016-11-62,193,2016,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Kanakanavu Rituals and the Reconstruction of Ethnic Community,Yao-Tung Lin,"intangible cultural heritage, cultural heritage, local society, identity, ritual","In the second half of the 20^(th) century, several western countries had responded positively to indigenous people's claim on their subjectivity. International organizations such as the United Nations, had also paid much attention to the protection of the intangible cultural heritage. These international trends brought changes that affected Taiwan on two fronts, the government's cultural and indigenous policies and the development of indigenous communities. In the second half of the 1980s, the dominant ethnicity discourse gradually shifted from Assimilationism to Multiculturalism. Policies enacted in the past that were obviously Assimilationist were seriously challenged. In this context, both the central and local governments have set up offices that oversee aboriginal affairs. On the one hand, disadvantaged ethnic groups are encouraged to actively participate in the enactment and execution of policies. On the other hand, the offices in question offer multiple resources for indigenous communities to improve their community landscape and revitalize their intangible cultural heritage. As a result, the indigenous peoples are able to gain more access to resources that help revitalize their traditional cultures (eg. rituals, languages, material cultures, etc.). And the government could assign cases of cultural heritage under legal protection. With the heightened sense of their cultural identities, the indigenous people also questioned the legitimacy of government's long-established ethnicity classification system. This subsequently led to the reconstruction of ethnic communities. The Kanakanavu people's endeavor to revitalize their ritual tradition and establish an official identity would serve as an obvious example. Previously recognized as a subgroup of Tsou or Tsau, the Kanakanavu people have continued, for more than twenty years, to reinstate ritual traditions, rebuild assembly halls, set up associations for ethnic cultural development, and preserve oral tradition and handicraft. It was not until 2014 did they finally gain legal status as the 16th indigenous people of Taiwan. Their persistence in cultural autonomy and sense of we-group-ness keep on impacting the national ethnic classification system. Even though there are disagreements, the Kanakanavu people's success has re-shaped their own perception of - as well as that of Tsou and Hla'alua - ethnic community and change the general public's understanding of Taiwanese indigenous people. I base the present study on my ethnography research which has been accumulated from extended years of studies. I propose to integrate discourses on intangible cultural heritage, to explore and analyze how the Kanakanavu people reconstructed the ＂imagined communities (of Kanakanavu, Hla'alua, and Tsou)＂ by enacting two most important rituals - mikong and kaisisi cakulan/cakuran-in its local and social context.

Constructing Subjectivity and Authenticity of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems: Exemplified by Chishang Canal Cultivation Areas and Shoufeng Riverbed Farming,Yu-Chuan Chang,"heritage discourse, Chishang (Taitung), Shoufeng (Hualien), Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS)","Various local cultural features originate from agriculture and thus have strong connections with the land itself. The complex relationship between humans and the land has shaped unique terrains and cultural landscapes, whereas human labor and land use evolved into discrete cultural practices. Currently registered agricultural world heritage are primarily agricultural landscapes and intangible cultural heritage sites, yet there is little discourse regarding agricultural heritage systems and practices. The Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) is a dynamic heritage conservation initiative adopting a comprehensive set of cultural practices for sustainable agriculture and land development. Therefore, investigating this evolution of heritage sites fills the lack of discourse on agricultural practices. Before planning and implementing heritage practices, examining the discourse on agricultural heritage is crucial because it influences the scope and potential development of the heritage concept. Fieldwork and literature analysis were adopted in this study to investigate locations in Eastern Taiwan. In this study, the irrigation system in the Taitung cultivation area, which flows via the Chishang channel, was investigated to demonstrate the subjectivity of heritage discourse. Using the discontinued cultivation of seedless watermelons in the riverbed farms of Shoufeng, Hualien as an example, this study discussed the authenticity of heritage discourse. By investigating the construction of heritage sites and the history of local development, the subjectivity and authenticity problems associated with heritage discourse is clarified.

"Recognition, Designation, and Local Practice of ＂Folk Custom and Related Cultural Artifacts＂: An Example of ＂Yunlin Liu Fang Ma Guolu＂",Yu-Tsuen Hsu,"historicity, intangible cultural heritage, folk custom and related cultural artifacts, recognition, local practice","Intangible cultural heritage (ICH) had been a world cultural trend within the recent two decades under the promotion of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). In Taiwan, folk festivals may be officially recognized and then designated as ＂Folk Custom and Related Cultural Artifacts＂ through the deliberation under the committees of local and central governments specifically. Once a festival earns such a title, it is considered as a great honor for its conservation group. The folk festival is originally locally practiced, now is intertwined with the influence of nation-states and global institutions. This article firstly reviews the concept formation and local practice of the ICH, as well as the institution of recognition and designation of ＂Folk Custom and Related Cultural Artifacts＂ in Taiwan context. Secondly, we will introduce the topic ＂Yunlin Liu Fang Ma Guolu＂ (Annual Rotation of Six Clan-branches' Heavenly Holy Mother) and its participation in the official recognition of cultural heritage. Thirdly, we analyze the cognition and negotiation between the local society and committee members of cultural heritage through the deliberation criteria of cultural heritage, including historicity, traditional properties, and local characteristics. Finally we focus on the empowerment by the government, scholars, and experts for the conservation group-the ROC Liu Fang Ma Association-which undertakes negotiation and management of the folk customs. The folk custom ＂Yunlin Liu Fang Ma Guolu＂ is highly fluid as its worship site change every year. It meets difficulties in the accumulation of historical archives and the changing performance of martial arts troops; therefore, the cultural heritage committee underscores the historicity of deity origin and the traditional properties of martial arts troops. However, in terms of local characteristics, the core characteristics of the folk custom are the involvement and creativity of local communities.

The Challenge of Succession: Decline and Revitalization of Shamanic Traditions in Paiwan Kulalao Village,Tai-Li Hu,"succession, Paiwan, shaman, revitalization, Kulalao Village","Unlike shamans who have low social status and who suffer from illness before being initiated in many other regions in the world, female Paiwan shamans, selected by shamanic ancestors who cause sacred beads (zaqu) to appear as a sign, are highly respected in the stratified Paiwan society. This paper attempts to examine the decline and revitalization of shamanic traditions of the indigenous Paiwan people in Taiwan from the colonial to the post-colonial periods, exemplified by Kulalao Village in southwestern Taiwan. In the post-colonial era, while most Paiwan villages have been Christianized and lost their shamanic traditions, Kulalao Village stands apart in that it has preserved and revitalized magnificent five-year ceremony and shamanic traditions.

This paper examines the ritual alteration of this pilgrimage in the heritagization process and its impact on the local community. The first part of this paper introduces the pilgrimage and its ritual features that demonstrate the reasons for listing it as a part of national cultural heritage. Some changes in the ritual practices of this pilgrimage are then reviewed as the consequences of heritagization. These alterations include the devaluation of some territorialized rituals, accommodation of new influences on translocal ritual practices, and creation of innovative meanings attached to the pilgrimage. Finally, an analysis is presented of how the heritagized pilgrimage has affected the local community. The pilgrimage has markedly improved the marginal social status of the community: it brings in a large contribution to the incense money for further development and expansion projects at the temple, and also draws numerous believers and commercial opportunities to the local community. Although local residents do not involve themselves in the official heritage practice, they are encouraged to engage in local activities held by community associations with government financial support.

Embroidered Images: Women's Inheritance of Embroidery Techniques and Local Miao Communities in Guizhou Province,Zhao-Hua Ho,"Shidong, embroidered images, Miao, local community, cultural inheritance, Zhenfeng","The study of material culture faces the challenges inherent in the characteristics of materiality itself, making it tricky to use material objects to show dynamic change in local communities. However, anthropological understandings of the relationship between materiality and social interaction have made significant progress in recent years. This examination of ethnographic data on Miao material culture not only shows the processes of socialization and civilization, it further illustrates that the inheritance of material knowledge is not necessarily a consequence of technology, but also involves the participation of language. This paper is an ethnographic study of the traditional embroidered images of Shidong Miao and Zhenfeng Miao societies in Guizhou Province. I argue that these images are a means of shaping Miao cultural identity and generating social boundaries. Through examining the changes of embroidered images among Shidong and Zhenfeng Miao through time, I show that both the indigenous people of Shidong and immigrants of Zhenfeng learned how to use embroidery to negotiate Miao identities in different social and historical contexts. The study aims to answer the question of how embroidered images and embroidery techniques become the collective medium to construct relations within Miao society. Additionally, it examines how Miao people use clothes as cultural heritage to transform their cultural ideal and as a way for women to claim their own social identity. Lastly, I explore how embroidered images become a social representation to distinguish social boundaries and define social relationships. By examining three different cases, this paper reveals diverse aspects of how women faced social and historical changes through embroidered images and clothing. The first case is that of Huang Laozhao, a Han girl who was compelled to become a Shidong Miao kidnappers wife. By adopting Shidong Miao weaving and clothes-making techniques, she found a way to fuse daughters into local society. The second case is that of Shi Tsaomei who was a Shidong Miao girl who married a Han man in Rongjiang County. For political reasons, she was forced to give up her Shidong Miao dress and pretend to be Han in order to negotiate with local society in Rongjiang County. The third case explores the stories of Zhenfeng Miao people who emigrated from Taijiang and Huangping Counties in southwestern Guizhou during the late Qing dynasty, escaping war and in search of agriculture land. Among them, women from gid eb (＂people from the riverside,＂ referring to Shidong) intermarried with gid bil men (＂people from the mountain＂). The embroidered images and clothes made by these women fused the traditions of both communities. From the viewpoint of Zhenfeng, gid eb people were assimilated into gid bil society, allowing for a flow of women which provided for successful social reproduction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201606-201608100006-201608100006-97-165,192,2016,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Study of Tapang Mayasvi Ritual Music as Oral Cultural Heritage,Yu-Hsiu Lu,"Takatomo Kurosawa, polyphony, mayasvi, music of Tsou","Tsou's mayasvi ritual song is an oral tradition passed down from generation to generation with its lyrics full of elusive archaic words. As the intangible cultural heritage that belongs to ethnic group's collective memory, it has a long history and held by societies. The existing two large societies of Tsou are Tapang and Tfuya, which have differences and similarities in aspect of mayasvi ritual song. It was found in observation of two societies' historical texts of music that due to the different transcription concepts of researchers, the music scores have shown diversity and made it difficult to affirm which society mayasvi ritual songs belongs to. Therefore, this paper firstly analyzes existing texts of music, attempts to transcribe with definition and paradigm by observing the repetitious practice and actual performance of Tapang's mayasvi ritual song. According to the study, singing mayasvi ritual song is accompanied with regular body waggling or foot moving. This is inherent metre and rule of transcription of Tsou's ritual song. Furthermore, singing polyphony in ritual song can be divided into two modes that one arranges position and melody direction and the other one join in singing occasional by following individual musical sensation and singing emotion. As for the difference between Tapang and Tfuya's ritual song, researchers generally mark where ritual music grows by different recording locations. However, as a result of the cognitive difference between insider and outsider, the interpretation of historical texts should build on analysis of music itself. Finally, this paper discusses the recording of mayasvi ritual song by Takatomo Kurosawa in 1943, which is the first preserved sound archive of Tsou's mayasvi. However, because of the limits of recording singers, form, place and technology, music has lost its own authenticity. Therefore, researchers must be especially careful in application of the historical texts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201606-201608100006-201608100006-167-197,192,2016,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Today, Singapore is home to about twenty professional kua-á-hì (also known locally as Min opera, for a river in Fujian Province, or as Fujian opera) troupes.

On the Origin and Pattern of Cult of Guanyin Buddha in Taiwan: A Case Study of Monga Longshan Temple,Ling-Kuang Fang,"arhat, pattern, folk literature, Guanyin Buddha, Monga Longshan Temple","The Monga Longshan Temple is the most important temple that worships Guanyin Buddha in Taiwan. Though originating from China, the popular belief in Guanyin underwent qualitative changes and developed a new type of cult in Taiwan. The new pattern of worship gradually spread to other temples. Based on my investigation from fieldwork, pictorial materials, and folk literature, I propose the following arguments. First, influenced by works of folk literature, such as Xiangshan baojuan, Nanhai Guanyin quanzhuan, Xiyou ji, etc., Guanyin followers in Taiwan generally believe that Princess Miaoshan who had left her home in search of spiritual cultivation eventually became Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva. Because her omnipotence and status equal those of a Buddha, she subjugated the eighteen arhats and others who later became her retinue of aides, and is referred respectfully as Guanyin Buddha. Second, The Guanyin Buddha of Taiwan is not a bodhisattva or Buddha in the Buddhist sense, but an omnipotent deity, whose image is not constructed from traditional Buddhist scriptures. It is a work based on folk literature that constantly highlights her almightiness and benevolence that serve as the critical factors of the Guanyin cult. Third, Guanyin followers in Taiwan invented two new types of shrines for Guanyin Buddha and her retinues. The combination of the statue of the deity and its shrine is a new pattern for the Guanyin cult. Fourth, this new pattern is inspired by folk literature, embodying people's collective consciousness and rich in local colors. Fifth, the template shrine of Monga Longshan Temple led to the popularity of this new pattern of worship. The new pattern of cult is like a piece of history, which embodies the subtle circumstances of the Guanyin cult in Taiwan and reflects its diversity and creativity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201603-201604280053-201604280053-153-217,191,2016,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
When a Taboo Becomes Hot Issue: On the Re-birth of Kingdom of Sipsong Panna under Touristic Situation,Shih-Chung Hsieh,"Tai-Lue, Sipsong Panna, extreme tourism, petty kingdom, Lue-logy","In this paper I have described the changing processes of defining Sipsong Panna within an inventory including a native state of the Tai-Lue people or Daizu 傣族, a China-appointed local administration, or a re-found luxurious kingdom in touristic rhetoric. The terms ＂Luelogy I＂ and ＂Lue-logy II＂ may be suitable to refer to the academic interest on Sipsong Panna from the Republic period through the Socialist era to the mid of 1990's. According to Han-Chinese understanding from Chinese historic materials today's Sipsong Panna was exactly the Cheli Xuenweisi or Cheli local administrative unit under Chinese imperial court. Therefore ＂petty kingdom＂ popularly suggested by most of international scholars to define Sipsong Panna and many traditional ethnicstates in Mainland Southeast Asia had been never found in contemporary Chinese academic materials. The Tai-Lue regime was only local authority instead of an independent kingdom so to speak. To call the traditional highest leader of Sipsong Panna ＂king＂ thus became a strict taboo.

"Art, Commerce, Politics, and Documentation: On the Xiqu Opera Movies and Its Influences on the Huangmeidiao Opera Movies",An-Chi Wang,"Yue Opera, Reformation of xiqu, Huangmeidiao movies, xiqu movies, Peking Opera","There are two topics in this essay; the first is a discussion of xiqu movies and its influence on Huangmeidiao movies. The second one is a two-way observation, on the influence of xiqu movies on the Huangmeidiao movies, and reversely on Huangmeidiao movies’ influence on the xiqu circle of Taiwan. Before 1949, the xiqu movies were mainly of Peking Opera. Because of the popularity of Peking Opera at that time, the movie producers obviously had commercial interests in mind. After 1949, many more opera genres flourished. The purpose for producing xiqu movies to be released overseas was a political one, i.e., winning support for the Chinese Communist regime. The huge success of Yue Opera Liangzhu (Butterfly Lovers) and Huangmeidiao Opera Tianxianpei (Heavenly Match) in Hong Kong not only generated lucrative revenue, but also inspired Hong Kong directors to develop a genre that came to be known as Huangmeidiao movies. This new genre was very popular in Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries, bringing in high profits for the Shaw Brothers Pictures Limited. In the second part of this essay, I describe the influences of Huangmeidiao movies on the traditional xiqu (Yue Opera, Goa-a Opera, and Peking Opera). My discussion centers on the fluidity and transmission of popular culture, from which I differentiate the relation between popular culture and traditional arts. In the final section, I discuss two Peking Opera movies Roselle and Liang Hongyu produced in Taiwan during the 1950s to 1960s. My thesis is based on books and newspapers, field research, collecting and viewing considerable number of films. Through examining the development of xiqu movies, their mutual influences, as well as presenting data and conducting case studies, I demonstrate xiqu movies’ significances in multiple dimensions, including arts, commerce, politics, and its role in archiving.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201512-201601280014-201601280014-1-66,190,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The four characters Buu Son Ki Huong stand for the sect’s lineage. The identity of Buu is still uncertain. ＂Son＂ refers to Doan Minh Huyen, who established the Buu Son Ki Huong sect. ＂Ki＂ is the founding leader of Tu An Hieu Nghia, Ngo Loi. Huong is unanimously considered to be Ta Ponl. Although Phat Giao Hoa Hao founded by Huynh Phu So is not identified here, the followers claimed themselves to belong to the same lineage. Their claim is rejected by the Tu An Hieu Nghia followers. However, when we examine them according to their Buddhist notions, we find the doctrines of Phat Giao Hoa Hao closely resemble that of Doan Minh Huyen’s Buu Son Ki Huong. Within the Tu An Hieu Nghia sect, the followers have kept several morality books written in mandarin Chinese. This deserves scholars’ attention, especially because the sect worships Lord Guan as their major deity. Their practice of filial piety is different from that of Chinese patrilineal society. In the followers’ houses, sacrifices are offered to both patrilineal and matrilineal ancestor tablets. This is a feature of the Tu An Hieu Nghia sect. Linh Son Hoi Thuong Kinh is the primary scripture of Tu An Hieu Nghia. Its content integrates the cult of Guanyin, the incantation of Esoteric Buddhism, and Vietnamese folk religion. It shows that Buddhism is the very substance of Tu An Hieu Nghia. Because its doctrines and rituals are full of traces of syncretism, its religious concept is more complicated than that of Buu Son Ki Huong when it was first founded by Doan Minh Huyen.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201512-201601280014-201601280014-67-127,190,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Gu Jiegang, who was in charge of the matter, had paid close attention to the Minnan (southern Fujian) Gezi (folk songs) booklets since he was teaching in Xiamen University previously. He purchased Gezi booklets from Quanzhou for the Folklore Artifacts Exhibition Room in Xiamen University. When he came to Guangzhou, he did the same for the Folklore Artifacts Exhibition Room in Sun Yat-sen University. After he arranged and sorted them, Gu Jiegang published the list in Folklore Weekly, October, 1928.

These Gezi booklets witnessed the Folklore Movement of last century. They are the first Gezi booklets to be archived by public organizations. Its unique historical significance cannot be overvalued.

Textual Interpretation and Cultural Translation: Yuan Drama ＂Lao Sheng Er＂ and Its Transmission to England,Shih-Pe Wang,"cross-cultural, John Francis Davis, English sinology, Yuan drama","Yuan zaju ＂Lao Sheng Er＂ is a family play, exhibiting ＂the joy and sorrow, the separation and reunion＂ of the common life during 13^(th) and 14^(th) century. This play depicting the lack of a son as a breach of filial piety in Chinese culture, gives shape to the concepts of the lineage, the patriarchy, and the ancestor worship in the ancient society. Due to its seemingly conservative theme, very little scholarly attention has been paid to it. However, it is noteworthy that ＂Lao Sheng Er＂ is the first Yuan play which was translated into English directly from the Chinese text, by John Francis Davis (1795-1890) of Britain in 1817. Davis also wrote a long introduction discussing Chinese drama and its theatrical tradition. Then, why did Davis choose this play as his first introductory work of Chinese drama to England? In what ways did his selection, translation and treatment of cultural differences respond to the problems of cross-cultural transmission? The first part of this paper will begin with textual interpretation of ＂Lao Sheng Er＂ and try to explore how the different editions influence the dramatis personae, the plot, and its subject matter.

"＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂: Translation, Adaptation, and Reception of a Chinese Comedy in France",Shih-Lung Lo,"Zheng Dehui, zaju, France, translation","In 1838, the French Sinologist Antoine Bazin translated and published an anthology entitled Le Théâtre chinois (The Chinese Theatre), in which Zheng Dehui's ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂ (or ＂Zhou Mei Xiang＂, literally ＂The Smart Housemaid Meï-hiang＂) was classified as a ＂comedy.＂ Bazin argued that the Chinese theatre, especially the comedy, reflected Chinese social manners and customs. To the contemporary French critics, the charm of this romantic love story came from its elegant dramatic language and well-constructed plot. They compared it to Marivaux's comedy and praised its delicate ＂Marivaudage＂ writing style. Little did they know that Chinese critics considered ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂ nothing but a plagiary of Wang Shifu's ＂Xi Xiang Ji＂ (＂The Story of the Western Wing＂). The French critics' misinformed judgment resulted from the much-delayed translation of ＂Xi Xiang Ji＂, by Stanislas Julien, published posthumously between 1872-1880. In his French work, Le Théâtre des Chinois: étude de moeurs comparées (＂The Theatre of Chinese People: A Comparative Study of Manners,＂ 1886) the Chinese diplomat Tcheng Ki-tong quoted Bazin's translation of ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂ to describe the function of the songs in the play, and the image and purpose of the role of maids. On the other hand, adaptions of ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂ also appeared in the late 19^(th) century. The most notable among them is Judith Gautier's short story, and the play script based on it. In 1900, a new translation of ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂ was put on the stage of the World Exposition as a representative Chinese play. Up until mid-20^(th) century, most anthologies of Chinese plays published in France had included Bazin's ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂, either in versions revised, re-translated, or translated-in-part. In this study, I will examine all these translations and adaptations of ＂Tchao-meï-hiang＂, and use them to analyze the reception of one of the most appreciated Chinese comedies in France.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201509-201511030003-201511030003-63-117,189,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Li Yu and Edo Literature: With a Focus on Ryutei Senka's ＂Seidan Tokiwa No Iroka＂ and ＂Mimeyori Zoshi＂,Han-Chen Shiau,"Ryutei Senka, Naihetian, Li Yu","The late Ming writer Li Yu's works had an extensive influence on Edo literature. In this article, I will discuss Ryutei Senka's ＂Seidan tokiwa no iroka＂, and ＂Mimeyori zoshi＂. Parts of their plots are adapted from Li Yu's drama ＂Naihetian＂. I will explore the relations between the three works, their characteristics and value in order to examine a facet of Li Yu's influence on the Edo literature. ＂Seidan tokiwa no iroka＂, was published in 1831. It depicts common people's romances and interpersonal relationships of the Edo era. Also known as ＂Honcho Naikaten＂ (＂Naihetian of our country＂), the author's intention to emulate Li Yu had been quite obvious. Senka adapted ＂Seidan tokiwa no iroka＂ into ＂Mimeyori zoshi＂  between 1842 and 1847. In the prefaces of the first and second volume, he had mentioned that his plots derived from ＂Naihetian＂. In the epilogue, Senka also describes the protagonist's bizarre incident of going through physical transformation in the original play. More than simply borrowing content from Li Yu's plays, in ＂Seidan tokiwa no iroka＂ and ＂Mimeyori zoshi＂, Senka also wove in cultural elements from traditional Japanese and Chinese literature, giving the two works an exotic style that is at once fresh and yet familiar. In particular, the anecdote of Ono no Komachi and the legend of Yang Guifei add a sense of reality and local elements to the fictional ＂Mimeyori zoshi＂. Furthermore, ＂Mimeyori zosh＂ contains several advertisements for the face powder label Biensennyo-ko, indicating influences from commercial publishing houses Through these two works, we not only perceive the ways Senka adapted Li Yu's drama, but also gain a view of the cultural interchange between China and Japan in the late Edo period.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201509-201511030003-201511030003-119-140%2b152-155,189,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Decline and Re-interpretation of Performer-Oriented Theater: Remarks on the Contemporaneity of Theater from Wei Haimin's Art of Performance,Yue-Lin Wu,"Wei Haimin, GuoGuang Opera Company, Contemporary Legend Theater, Contemporary Beijing Opera, performer-oriented theater","The performer-oriented theater is an artistic feature of Chinese traditional theater, in which actors' art of performance constitutes the gist of the play and the focal point of viewers' attention. The thesis of this study derived from my query into the seemingly fixed relationship between performer-oriented theater and traditional theater. At the same time, I would like to investigate whether performer-oriented theater, after the introduction of western theatrical concepts, is disintegrating, or are there possibilities of contemporary reinterpretation. Subsequently, this study proceeds in two directions. I first examine the art history and definition of performer-oriented theater to describe its inception and decline. On this basis, I analyze the artistic nature of Wei Haimin's boundary-crossing performances in order to elucidate meanings of contemporary theater and the re-interpretation and construction of the performer-oriented theater. Finally, the purpose of this study is to give an account of the disintegration process of the performer-oriented theater and the reinterpretation of modern theater. The modern day ＂performer-oriented theater,＂ in my opinion, no longer serves to highlight individual performers; instead, it collaborates with playwrights and directors to bring out the very substance of theater. While promoting performance and literariness, the performer-oriented theater coexists with the performers, attaining a balanced relation that enables the continuation of traditional theater and its contemporaneity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201509-201511030003-201511030003-157-215,189,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Spirit Mediums in Western Hunan: An Ethnographic Report,Shih-Yu Kang,"Miao, training by deceased masters, Western Hunan, female and male spirit mediums, ritual specialists, training by living masters","This paper describes ritual specialists in Western Hunan's Miao areas, namely female and male spirit mediums referred to as ＂zimei＂ 子妹(tsi^(53)mei^(35) in Miao). Most specialists are women (usually labeled ＂xianniang 仙娘＂), although some men become mediums as well (＂xianshi 仙師＂). Based on fieldwork among both female and male spirit mediums, this paper provides data on their lives and careers, while also addressing the following questions: How important are such specialists in people's lives? How are mediums trained, and what types of rites do they perform? What taboos are they bound to observe? How do their rituals differ in different areas? In what ways are their ritual traditions linked to Miao ideas of family and lineage? The data collected to-date reveals that female and male mediums learn their trade in two different ways: training by living masters (yangchuan 陽傳) and training by deceased masters (yinchuan 陰傳), with the latter form of transmission being as prevalent (or even more common) than the former. Spirit mediums remain active throughout Western Hunan (including both rural and urban areas), in large part due to their skill in treating a wide range of illnesses and life crises. While in trance, they can cure disease, communicate with the dead, comfort frightened children, and provide other forms of spiritual guidance. Studying Western Hunan's spirit mediums can help us better understand key aspects of Miao religious culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201509-201511030003-201511030003-217-312,189,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Burning Paper Clothes Rites and Transmission Patterns of Zhuang Ritual Specialists in Southwest Guangxi,Ya-Ning Kao,"spirit soldiers, Guangxi, Zhuang religion, ritual specialists, burning spirit clothes","Each year on the fourteenth day of the seventh lunar month, Zhuang 壯 households in the counties of Debao 德保, Jingxi 靖西 and Napo 那坡 in southwest Guangxi stage rites featuring the burning of paper clothes for the spirits of people who died normal deaths. Meanwhile, local Zhuang ritual specialists known as memoed 末婆 (female) and gemoed 末公 (male), who are the agents or mediums of deities, ancestors, and ghosts, conduct similar rites of burning paper clothes for their patriarchs and spirit soldiers. The extant literature on Zhuang ritual specialists tends to focus on initiation rites, ritual performances and analyses of ritual texts. Only a few studies pay attention to the Zhuang spirit system, and no studies exist on how Zhuang ritual specialists maintain and enhance their ritual powers, or the interactions between ritual specialists and people who participate in these rites. This paper examines rites for burning paper clothes at the household altars of ritual specialists on behalf of spirit soldiers who suffered abnormal deaths and might harm local families or entire villages. I consider how such rites on the one hand connect the living and the dead, and on the other hand ensure the continuity of local Zhuang ritual specialists and their supporters' groups. This paper also attempts to transcend C. K. Yang's dichotomy of ＂institutional religion＂ and ＂diffused religion＂ for studying Chinese religious life. Instead, I suggest that researchers may gain a better understanding of the continuity and expansion of local Zhuang religion through further investigations of the interactions between ritual actors, including the dead, the living and ritual specialists.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201506-201508030001-201508030001-55-108,188,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Ritual Specialists and History in Shidong Miao Society, Guizhou Province",Zhao-Hua Ho,"Shidong, religion, gender, ritual, ritual specialists","This paper presents an ethnographic study of the relationship between ritual specialists and local history in Miao 苗 communities located in Shidong 施洞 Town (southeastern Guizhou Province). It describes how three different types of ritual specialists complement each other in their practices as they help people cope with life's struggles. When facing a problem, Shidong Miao will invite a female spirit medium (wuk zangs dliangb; shenpo 神婆 in Chinese) to perform a divination ritual known as ＂asking the road＂ (wenlu 問路) in order to discover the source of the problem. If the cause is discovered to be a ghost, ancestor, or dragon, they will ask a male spirit medium (ghet xangs dliangb; guishi 鬼師) to perform an exorcism. However, if the cause stems from an imbalance of yin 陰 and yang 陽, events taking place on an inauspicious date, or improper geomancy (fengshui 風水), people will invite a ritual specialist known as a ＂ghet xangs did lix＂ (dili shifu 地理師傅, literally ＂master of earthly principles＂) to solve the problem. The first type of ritual specialists are considered to embody the characteristics of yin (raw, cold, darkness), and are able to transform themselves into vessels capable of containing ghosts. In contrast, the second type take on the characteristics of yang (cooked, hot, brightness), and are able to use ghostly forces to control other ghosts. Finally the third type of ritual specialist utilizes characteristics of civilization, sacredness, and masculinity to act as interpreters who carry out the principle of ＂dao 道＂ according to ideas of yin-yang and the Five Elements (wuxing 五行). The reflexive expressions of these three kinds of ritual performances demonstrate the complexity of local history, particularly the Shidong Miao people's memory of resistance and isolation. At the same time, they also reveal ideas of assimilation or submission to imperial power.During her rituals, the female spirit medium expresses the power of resistance by embodying the spirit of the powerful ghost known as Ghet liangl 勾兩, a mythical figure who could sprint and fly, inspiring terror in the Chinese emperor, who ordered him put to death. However, while this may be necessary for the sake of the ritual, allowing both the medium and the ghost possessing her into the village is considered dangerous, so villagers also worship an earth god (tudi pusa 土地菩薩) for protection. In contrast, due to his ability to use ghosts to control ghosts, the male medium displays his administrative status in Miao society. In contrast to female mediums, who are possessed by mythical ghosts, male mediums deal with the communal dead, who are divided into three categories: those who die peacefully and become ancestors; those who die outside the community and become ghosts; those who inhabit tombs and become transformed into dragons, spirits possessing great magical power yet also reflecting ＂otherness＂. The male medium's rituals isolate and drive away ghosts, while also incorporating more positive spiritual forces, for example by pulling a dragon into a villager's house in order to bring fortune and fertility. Finally, by using yin and yang, the Five Elements, and fengshui, the dili shifu are able to create good fortune and change one's destiny. The phenomena described above reveal the diversity and complexity of religious life in Shidong Miao society, while also providing a window to understand processes of historization, thereby allowing us to trace how the Shidong Miao have negotiated different conceptualizations of power through ritual performances and in daily life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201506-201508030001-201508030001-109-176,188,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The data collected strongly suggests that the practices and documents employed during these ceremonies are integral for grasping the essence of Yao ritual knowledge. My research aims at clarifying the overarching theme underlining the ＂Huanjiayuan＂ initiation, through which a person's ordination name would be written down in the household genealogy (jiaxiandan 家先單), allowing him/her to be worshipped as an ancestor after departing this world. The first part of the paper lays out the entire ritual program that involves the recitation of Pan Wang songs, with the discussion centering on how the Pan Wang legend has shaped these rites. In particular, the ritual singing which commences in Q & A form exemplifies why the ritual needs to be held. The paper's second section confirms that the myth of ＂Crossing the Ocean＂ (in which the Pan Wang saved the Yao after they made vows to offer sacrifices to him) is indeed a recurring theme in the ritual. Accordingly, the ritual not only honors the vow that the Yao made to Pan Wang, but also re-affirms the relationship the Yao have with their ancestors. The final portion of the paper reveals that the performance of the first half of the ＂Huanjiayuan＂ initiation may vary according to individual vows different surname groups made with Pan Wang, but the performance of the second half invariably represents the myth of ＂Crossing the Ocean＂. Last but not least, the overarching theme of ＂honoring the vow to Pan Wang＂ as represented by the ＂Huanjiay-uan＂ initiation is positively intertwined with other Yao ritual performances.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201506-201508030001-201508030001-177-249,188,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

This fact helps to enhance systematic understanding of local social structure and regional cultural traditions. The Taiping Rebellion of late Qing caused the cults of Wang Hua and Zhang Bo to decline rapidly. This is an important reason that accounted for the ineffectiveness of modern day field investigation.

During the Ming dynasty, local spirits of various origins became worshipped as guardian deities of the Buddhist religion and subsequently incorporated into the state cult. By analyzing four such cults located in the southern area of the Dali plain (a water spirit, the Blue Dragon Goddess, the ancient hero Duan Chicheng 段赤城, and the Tang general Lee Mi 李宓), this paper considers the historical processes by which they were converted into Dragon Kings (＂nagas＂) by Buddhist monks as well as state cult deities. At the same time, however, this paper also examines how different groups of Dali people (including indigenous ritual clans, native soldiers, Han military forces, and local officials) competed to have their spirits recognized as a means of legitimizing their status and influence in local society. By highlighting the processes of agency through which ritual orthodoxy could be defined, this paper demonstrates that the historical development of these four cults can help shed new light on local strategies of negotiation and social mobility, all of which contributed to the development of Dali's vibrant religious life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201503-201505040010-201505040010-105-154,187,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Religion as a Civilizing Process? Rethinking Yao Religious Culture and Ritual Manuscripts,Mei-Wen Chen,"Chinese imperial state, ordination, ritual manuscripts, religion, Yao","This article suggests that the Yao religious domain should be considered as an interface where the Chinese imperial state attempted to assert its ＂civilizing＂ power by incorporating local society into official governance, yet also where the Yao not only assimilated but also transformed imperial influences in the light of their own cultural values. It explores these issues by describing the patrilineal ideology of Yao ordination and its impact on the transmission of ritual manuscripts. Another key issue centres on the ways in which the ideological basis of filial piety, an important Confucian value at the core of ancestor worship, has been re-employed to sustain the practice of Yao ordination as well as their manuscript culture. Yao ritual manuscripts have generally been regarded as literary manifestations of the success of the imperial ＂civilizing project＂ among non-Han peoples, with previous scholarship considering Yao ritual manuscripts in terms of their contents and treating them as mere ＂textual artefacts＂. In contrast, this essay argues in favor of conceptualizing Yao ritual manuscripts as ＂objects of value＂, and shows how the Yao have projected their diverse perceptions of the state's ＂civilizing＂ power as part of the cultural value attached to writing, as well as the object-hood embodied in ritual manuscripts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201503-201505040010-201505040010-155-209,187,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

In this article, I will investigate local perception in Puli on the jiao process from the perspective of ＂rite of passage＂ and ＂ritualization.＂ I will explicate the local cognition on ＂jiao as pudu＂ and ＂the presentation of jiao.＂ To say that ＂jiao as pudu＂ is to connect ritual performance with local religious community's context of publicness, particularly the influences from the Flying Phoenix Halls and the Vegetarian Halls. Actors (partakers) from different coalitions perceive and enact the jiao in their own ways and demonstrate the ritualization process of constructing local communitas. They compete, cooperate, and negotiate in this contention for power. At the same time, through execution of jiao preparation in multiple ritual space, they embody a state of communitas and carry out the rite of passage in each own communal context. The case study illustrates complicated dialectical relations between Daoist ritual performance and local society. The program of the Daoist ritual scheme (科儀表 keyibiao) is the axis of the entire jiao procedure. Its factual content and style, on the other hand, has to conform to local tradition. Although it is the Daoist(s) who set up the altar and perform the offering, forces from different contexts-including changes in local power structure, business competition between Daoist troupes and regional ritual conventions-all affect the ways a jiao is presented. In this study, I suggest that an analysis of the ritual experts' performance is not enough to explain how the jiao transforms local society. It is also mandatory that we examine and elucidate conventions of the local religion and characteristics of ritual performance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201503-201505040010-201505040010-211-296,187,2015,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"The Context, Memory, and Interpretation of Cultural Heritage: A Case Study of Wansan Stone Carvings",Mei-Ching Wang,"Wansan Stone Carvings, cultural asset, cultural heritage, old Wansan settlement, Shia-san-she Rukai","Anthropologists place much emphasis on an interwoven relationship between memories and cultural contexts. Although memories exist in everyone's mind, a society has mechanisms to bolster an individual's collective memory, and to consolidate the group members' consensus and shape their identities. Memories can be selective; each narrative about the heritage competes against the other. Although memories are conditioned by culture, individuals can negotiate and enforce identities by manipulating memories. Through the practice of narration, the agents can super-scribe new meanings on the experiences, and continue to offer interpretations according to the individuals' purposes and needs. This essay will discuss the Wansan people's intent to conserve their cultural heritages. On the one hand, it is to boost local tourism. On the other hand, the heritage site becomes a venue on which the people construct their cultural identities and re-present traditional culture. This essay plans to explore how the Wansan people employ narratives to give new meanings to the cultural heritage, Wansan Stone Carvings, and how they construct individual and collective memories and representation through constant interpretations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201412-201501280035-201501280035-11-57,186,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Belief, Memory, and Construction: On the ＂Guolu＂ Ritual of Liufangma",Han-Wei Huang,"legend, tacit knowledge, cultural heritage, collective memory","The cult of Liufangma (Mother from the sixth branch) spreads within Yunlin and Jiayi counties, its major rotating sacrifice covering Dounan, Tuku, Wujiancuo, Dabeishi, and Guoxi areas. There are several versions of the origins of the cult in spirit-writing. Nearly all of them point to a Lin family who brought this deity to Taiwan from their hometown in China. Originally worshipped within the Lin clan, till this day, followers from these areas still call this goddess ＂grandaunt＂ or ＂grandaunt from the sixth branch,＂ indicating a shared collective memory. However, some followers' interpretation and textual research of the legend challenged previous spirit-writing versions. In recent years, the government and non-governmental sectors have placed much attention on the cultural heritage, while the locals responded with their own constructed history. Together they revealed to the changeable nature of popular religion. From the perspective of intangible cultural heritage, popular religion and ritual activities carry a feature of learning by participation. This kind of learning is rooted in life experiences and forms a focus of collective identity. In the Liufangma ＂guolu＂ (＂handing over the incense burner＂) ritual, all members acquire knowledge of different categories and levels. During the process, they manifest the latent wisdom of this cult and the features of learning embedded in ritual practice. Collective memory of the five shares influences modern followers in their view of this ritual festivity. Consequently, some followers trace the origin of the legend and re-examine versions in the spirit-writing from the past. The upholding of this rotating worship system, the preservation and activation of cultural heritage all hinge on the collective memory. More than simply passing on the belief itself, local knowledge also relies on this collective memory to perpetuate. The purpose of this study is to investigate current circumstances of the Liufangma cult, to observe religious belief as a cultural heritage, a vehicle to which the follower's collective memory is attached. Through the practice of ritual activities and construction of local history, I present the process of how a cult serves to shape a local society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201412-201501280035-201501280035-59-101,186,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Qing Imperial Plaques Kept in the Mazu Temples in Taiwan: The Collective Memory and Political Myths,Chian-Wei Lee,"imperial plaque, political myths, Mazu temples, collective memory","Many Mazu temples in Taiwan boast an imperial plaque bearing an emperor's royal signet. It carries such phrase as ＂Shen Zhao Hai Biao＂ (The light of goddess shines on the surface of the sea), or ＂Hai Guo An Lan＂ (May the goddess bring peace the realm of sea), or Yu Tian Tong Gong (The goddess' merit equals that of Heaven), with the last being most frequently found. The ＂Qing Veritable Records＂ notes that in the year 1881, the Guangxu Emperor bestowed the Yu Tian Tong Gong plaques to all the Mazu temples under the jurisdiction of Taiwan prefect. Based on documents and my field investigation, there are twenty ＂Yu Tian Tong Gong＂ plaques in total. These plaques can be categorized into the following types according to the carver's craftsmanship, style of calligraphy, format of the signet, and history of the temples. First, plaques with unequivocal Qing imperial features. Second, plaques with Qing features, but not imperial plaques. Third, plaques with similar calligraphic style, or plaques that had been re-carved at a later date. Fourth, plaques that are neither imperially bestowed, nor dating from the Qing dynasty. Temples continued to duplicate the imperial plaques with the assumption that the presence of the emperor's plaque and his signet would imply an officially recognized status. In addition, Ming Qing calligraphers and artists incessantly copied paintings and scrolls of calligraphy by Song and Yuan artists. This tradition of imitating old masters caused the scripts on the plaques to be copied, re-copied, and circulated, forming a unique calligraphy tradition. In this study, I point out that mass reproduction of the late Qing imperial plaques is a re-mythologizing process on the users' part. When the emperor bestowed a plaque on a certain temple, he meant to have Mazu's benevolence and merits. However, because plaque is a strong political orthodoxy symbol, an officially recognized status is implied. This is a new political symbol enforced in a new context. Likewise, for many late Qing Mazu temples, owning an imperial plaque not only elevates the temple's prestige, brings a sense of pride but also consolidates followers' identity. It becomes a concrete material symbol, centering on the temple, that integrates a community's collective memories.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201412-201501280035-201501280035-103-179,186,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Study on the Organization and Review System of the Xiahai City God's Temple Festival during the Japanese Colonial Era,Chen-Hung Kao,"Dadaocheng, temple festival culture, festival palanquin, Xiahai City God","In this study, I make use of reports from the ＂Taiwan Daily News＂, supplemented by my field investigation, to construct the circumstances of the Xiahai City God's temple festival during the Japanese colonial era. I approach the issue from two perspectives, the festivity organization and the review system. In the first section, I compare and analyze documents to disentangle the complicated relations between Xiahai City God Temple, the Hainei coalition, and Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Jin Tong Shun. It was the Chen family of Hainei coalition that brought the Xiahai City God to Taiwan. However, the temple construction and funds for festivities were either promoted or handled by Jin Tong Shun which wielded local power. The profits from selling paper cangues during the temple festivals were so huge that many representatives of the festival organization embezzled this money to line their own pockets. Jin Tong Shun had failed to suggest effective management solutions. As a result, severe clashes occurred between the Hainei coalition and Jin Tong Shun in 1918. Although a festival committee was organized afterwards, Jin Tong Shun still controlled the actual management. The only change was members of ＂Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Jin Tong Shun＂ had expanded from the original retail sellers to include local gentry merchants of Dadaocheng. Yet, both sides have still held a grudge against each other up to today. The second section describes the Xiahai City God's temple festival through the review system. The Japanese colonial era was a time when advertisements prevailed. Advertisements were considered an indicator of modernization. Under such circumstances, traditional festival palanquins were required to carry advertisements as well. In 1920, the Qianyuan Company took the initiative and invite officials, gentlemen, and news reporters to rate and give awards to the ＂yige＂ festival palanquins and musical troupes. Festival palanquins that featured a combination of traditional stories with modern advertisements won the higher scores. Whereas, judges for musical troupes showed a preference for banners and artifacts that best embodied the troupe's sophistication. The competition represented a taste of the gentry class that gave priority to tradition, with an integration of modern innovation. This observation serves to reverse the existent prejudice that temple festivals tended to be vulgar in taste. The City God Temple festival of Japanese colonial era, led by the gentry stratum of the society, demonstrated a composite outlook that was at once traditional and modern, sophisticated and popular. The Xiahai City God and the Beigang Mazu are the two paragons of temple festivities in Taiwan. In addition, the City God Temple festival also drew population from other areas to Taipei. The relations and alliances between temples and musical troupes, on the other hand, dispersed the population of Taipei to other areas. Community interaction formed within the island of Taiwan had encouraged connections and developments of economy and people between different areas.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201412-201501280035-201501280035-181-229,186,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Lost Art of Martial Troupe: Daojiang Xiahai Bajiang Troupe,Shiu-Chun Chung,"temple festivals, Daojiang Xiahai Bajiang Troupe, Dadaocheng, Xiahai City God, performance troupes","As the old saying goes, ＂On the thirteenth of the fifth month, people watch people.＂ It describes the spectacular event of Xiahai City God's fest ival in Dadaocheng, Taipei. The economic boom in Dadaocheng, born out of a particular historical background, propelled the festival's scale and popularity to its pinnacle. With a strong judicial character, the Xiahai City God's festival was among the most important temple festivals in Taiwan. One significant part of the culture of the performance troupes in Taiwan is for people to dress up as guardian generals of deities. This is even more obvious in judicial deities' temple festivals. The Daojiang Bajiang Troupe, organized by the Xiahai City God Festival Committee, was a troupe composed of followers who would redeem their vow to the City God by serving as his guardian generals. It later developed into a troupe chosen to escort the City God's palanquin. Unlike other martial performance troupes in Tainan or Xinzhuang, the growth and creativity of Daojiang Xiahai Bajiang's characters, choreography, and paraphernalia were unique in the performance troupe culture and a pride of local people. The Bajiang Troupe, organized and funded by local powers, had been active for more than twenty years. It was disbanded in the 1990s abruptly, leaving many questions behind. Why did such an important escort troupe of guardian generals suddenly disappear from the Xiahai City God's festival stage? The Dadaocheng Temple Festival Exhibition in 2012 displayed several guardian general troupes like ＂guanjiangshou＂ and ＂shijiajiang＂, ＂bajiang＂, etc. However, there was no trace of the once-famous local troupe. The weird absence aroused my curiosity. In this study, I did field investigation to describe in details the troupe's origin and development, intention, and the process of its breakup. I investigate this troupe, its significance in the Xiahai City God festival, as well as local stories born out of decades of its vicissitude.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201412-201501280035-201501280035-231-302,186,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Jongmyo Jeryeak and Its Preservation Today,Patricia Huang,"intangible cultural property, w□nhy□ng, Pak Yon, Jongmyo Jeryeak","Jongmyo, Seoul, the oldest Confucian imperial shrine preserved, is dedicated to the forefathers of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910). Ritual ceremonies called Jongmyo Jerye were held five times a year here to pay tributes to the royal ancestors, and were deemed one of the most important rites for a state to perform. The accompanying Jongmyo Jeryeak music/dance performance was therefore understandably solemn and elaborate. During the Sejong's reign (r. 1419-1450), official Pak Yon attempted to reconstruct the ancient Chinese form of Jongmyo Jeryeak, but later on, Sejo (r. 1469-1494) decided to adopt two suites of music/dance, ＂Botaepyeong＂ and ＂Jeongdaeeop,＂ as the new Jongmyo Jeryeak, and the practice lasted through all the succeeding generations. In 1962, Jongmyo Jeryeak became the first designated Important Intangible Cultural Property in the Republic of Korea, and since the 70s, the ceremony has been reinstated and held on the first Sunday of May, an open event that sees thousands of spectators lining the streets and the quiet sanctuary to celebrate. Internationally, Jongymo and the Annuals of Joseon were designated as World Heritage in 1995 and World Memory in 1997 respectively. In 2001, Jongmyo Jerye and Jongmyo Jeryeak were jointly proclaimed as Masterpiece of Human Oral and Intangible Heritage. Intangible cultural heritage refers to the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge and skills that people recognize as part of their cultural heritage. Its safeguarding requires taking community of practitioners and documentation into careful consideration. Thanks to the preservation of Jongmyo and the Annals, the original place and documentation, Jongmyo Jeryeak today can still be performed according to its ＂original form.＂ The tangible context not only helps the intangible music/dance to be remembered, but to be ＂remembered correctly.＂ However, we must also point out that, even with the physical framework relatively intact, the meaning of Jongmyo Jeryeak inevitably changes as newer shareholders come into the picture. Will the tangible context ＂fossilize＂ the intangible cultural heritage and confine it to the ＂original form＂ or ＂authenticity＂? Or will tangible context act as the detailed archive that allows intangible cultural heritage to constantly be recreated without forgetting its earlier form? The aim of this paper is to examine the case of Jongmyo Jeryeak and discuss the role that tangible context plays in the fluidity of culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201409-201410310011-201410310011-11-49,185,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
When ＂Making Motifs＂ Becomes ＂Making a Person＂: Continuity and Change of Shidong Miao Intangible Cultural Heritage,Zhao-Hua Ho,"Shidong, Miao, memories, making motifs, transmitters, intangible cultural heritage","This paper presents an ethnographic study on intangible cultural heritage of Shidong Miao society in Southeastern Guizhou Province. It aims to describe how Miao women and silversmiths transform themselves from local elites into transmitters of intangible cultural heritage. It also explores how these individuals construct cultural capital through making and promoting embroidery and silver accessories in Shidong Miao society. This paper explores the making of embroidery and silver accessory motifs which are the core traditional handicrafts of Shidong Miao and how, as a means to protect social status and achieve a higher social position, Shidong Miao people are strengthening their publicity and turning the production of intangible cultural heritage into businesses. Making money and training younger generation are two different duties for transmitters. In the production of embroidery, transmitters focus on both making money and transforming the system of transmittance from mother to daughter into a company network. Among silversmiths, transmitters pay more attention to passing techniques to the next generation via a father-son system and make efforts to contain these skills within a single household. This paper will present four aspects of intangible cultural heritage from Shidong. First, I will briefly recount the history of techniques for ＂making motifs＂ and decorative expression in embroidery and on silver accessories in the Shidong Miao tradition. Second, I will examine and analyze a number of embroidery and silver accessory images and explore the changes to motifs to provide an understanding of how classical images have been represented through different periods. Third, I will explore how transmitters portray their social and cultural capital through performance and in social relationships. Lastly, by situating Shidong Miao society within its historical context, I will provide an interpretation of the impact intangible cultural heritage transmitters have on Miao society through their political and economic advantages.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201409-201410310011-201410310011-51-114,185,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Memories from Meige, the Epic Poem of Creation: Traditional Songs of Chuxiong Yi and Their Re-presentations",Chi-Ping Huang,"Meige, cultural memory, intangible cultural heritage, Mayou village, Chuxiong Yi","Cultural memory is accumulated from experience. Experience is closely intertwined with living environments. However, when environmental changes caused experiences to alter accordingly, the cultural memory had to be held up with represented interpretation. The case studied in this article is the ＂Meige Revival＂ of Chuxiong Yi people in southwest China. The ＂Meige＂ are ballads of Lipo and Lolopo, two branches of Yi. Their epic poem of Creation has won much attention. During the Cultural Revolution, Meige had been banned and nearly died out. After the Cultural Revolution, Meige had again regained significant status. To save and preserve Meige, the State Council of China listed Meige in its second batch of intangible cultural heritage in 2008. Meige, before and after the revival, carries two different kinds of memories. Traditionally, Meige was a type of melody that accompanies the customs of Lipo and Lolopo. On the occasions of life rituals, Meige was recited during the rituals, or sung as a duet in everyday life. There were also Meige gathering, where people sang in celebration joyously. This is the traditional memory of Meige. With the passing of time, the native language and traditional society of Lipo and Lolopo gradually disappeared. Currently, the only thing that can summon Lipo's and Lolopo's memory is a Meige compilation published in mandarin in 1959. Although a significant publication in Yi folk literature, this reconstructed version is not a rigorous verbatim documentation. On the contrary, it was a new creation, published in mandarin. Meige, reconstructed this way, can neither be recited nor sung in duets. However, the reconstructed Meige has become a performance act on stage. To promote tourism, the public sector recreates a Meige culture atmosphere. This is the new memory of reconstructed Meige. For Lipo and Lolopo, whose native language environments had changed, the re-presented and re-constructed Meige culture serves the public sector's purpose to control their memory. Meige plays an important role in building a collective identity. In this article, I study the process of Meige revival in Chuxiong Yi to explore the different aspects of memory construction in different time and cultural backgrounds.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201409-201410310011-201410310011-115-166,185,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Witchcraft Accusations against Sax Biinv: Stigmatizing Neighbours as Social Drama,Fang-Tzu Yen,"marriage, Kam (Dong), sax biinv, social drama, witchcraft","Sax biinv emerged in the mountainous areas of southern Guizhou during the Ming and Qing periods, at a time when serious conflict broke out between the government and local society. The Ming opened a major postal road to Yunnan through southeastern Guizhou, and the Qing continued to advance their armies through the untamed Miao lands in the mountain areas of southeastern Guizhou, opening up a trade route between Guizhou and the provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. To counteract this, the minority peoples of southeastern Guizhou put up one rebellion after another, until finally in the 18th century the Qing government was able to subdue the area. In the course of this intense conflict, new symbols and new legends made their appearance in local society, along with new customary laws and social structures. These were meant to help stabilise local Kam (Dong) society, which was becoming unstable. The fieldwork site for the present study-Bian village, is located in a remote mountain area between the northern part of Congjiang county and the border with Liping county in Guizhou. This is one of the areas in which sax biinv appeared. As far as Bian village is concerned, the sax biinv are not just the stuff of rumour or legends, but are a fact of life in local society, and the subject matter of a social drama in which all residents take part. This article will first explain the social origins of witchcraft accusations against sax biinv. Then, using Turner's theory of social drama, and making use of materials drawn from ethnographic research, it will explain how witchcraft accusations against sax biinv, conveyed through rumour and legendary stories, were used in order to mobilise local society, and enact a series of social dramas in which their neighbours' reputations were blackened. The third part will examine in detail how this social mechanism affects marriage patterns in society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201409-201410310011-201410310011-167-217,185,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Textual Medium of Ritual Transmission: Analysis of Jiedu Scripts of Zhuang Shigong in Shanglin County, Guangxi Province",Yan-Jia Qin,"textual medium, ritual heritage, script, Zhuang shigong","The jiedu initiation rite is a pivotal path for ritual experts to carry on their tradition. It is also an important basis for us to differentiate between traditions of ritual experts. In the past, when studying local ritual tradition, the researchers used to pay more attention to the ritual structure, religious pantheon, ritual context of the village and interactions between different ritual experts. Rarely did they bring the ritual experts' internal practices of ritual transmission into discussion. Use of texts is one of the core content of ritual practice. We need to conduct indepth analysis of the ritual texts within ritual context. The shigong of the Zhuang people in the central region of Guangxi use many scripts during the jiedu initiation rites. They summarize the process of initiation and give reasons why a disciple becomes a shigong. The shigong uses a script in the jiedu initiation ritual to indoctrinate his disciples. Narration of the scripts and ritual process demonstrate shigong's conceptual interpretation of the Shijiao subjectivity. Through analysis of scripts used in the jiedu initiation ritual, we can determine that this core textual media is an important written criterion the shigong used to construct their own ritual tradition. It is also an important symbol that separates them from other local ritual experts like Daoist and Buddhist masters. The script consolidates their master-disciple relationship through ritual performance and embodies the intent behind the ritual. With the completion of ritual, the initiated undergoes the indoctrination process of the shigong ritual heritage. The shigong who presides over the ritual also re recognizes and confirms the script content. This helps the shigong tradition to remain relative consistent within certain regions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201409-201410310011-201410310011-219-295,185,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

In addition to preface and conclusion, this article consists of three sections. I first analyze earlier rituals of the ＂pacification of plagues＂ and compare several manuscripts with a perspective on the public-ness and private-ness of the organizers of the plague offering rituals. I further explore the relations between Daoist manuscripts of the ＂pacification of plagues＂ in Taiwan, the Divine Empyrean plague exorcism rituals recorded in A Corpus of Daoist Rituals, and the Rituals and Liturgies of Sending Royal Boat of Ming-Qing southern Fujian. By investigating the significance of the manuscripts, we can identify the origins and lineages of these Daoist rituals. In the second section, I discuss the boat burning ritual scenario as well as the various roles and duties of the participants recorded in Taiwan's Qing manuscripts, and the symbolic meanings of the place names to which the plague commissioners were supposed to report after the mission was completed. I also analyze the historical significance of a Daoist document of Five-day Offering Rituals dated 1821 from Xinyuan of Pingdong. Finally, I examine four significant Daoist rituals and liturgies- Divine Lamp of Five Thunders Lightning; Celestial Immortals Feasting and Offering; Pacification of Plagues and Fiends Quelling; and Disaster Dispelling and Plague Offering and identify similarities and differences between Tainan Daoist school and Fengshan Daoist school, as well as characteristics of ritual practitioners' body techniques.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201406-201408040010-201408040010-9-57,184,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The period covered is from the Song dynasty to the present time. There is documentary evidence of Meishan aboriginal groups active in the region from the Tang and the Five dynasties. During the northern Song, the Meishan area was developed by the imperial government. Meishan served hereafter not only as a geographical label but was also generally identified with the indigenous people and local spirits. From the late Yuan to the early Ming, newcomers used fashu (＂spiritual power＂) which co-operated with Lushan Daoist traditions to sanctify their landownership. Applying fashu became a predominant approach to open up primitive land. This is a significant period when the Meishan tradition and the Lushan Daoist tradition mixed together. In the mid-Ming, when the order was restored by the imperial government after the rebellion; the City God, a symbol of the imperial government, was incorporated into the belief system of local society, with the spread of the Zhengyi sect (Orthodox Oneness Sect).

A Research on the Form and Character of Zheng Folk Tunes in Hakka and Chaozhou Music,Li-Chiung Chang,"zheng music, waijiang, Chaozhou, folk tunes, Hakka, chuandiao","There are numerous folk tunes circulating in Chinese society. These are pieces of musical art incorporated in the diverse processes of folk music tradition. The performance of traditional zheng absorbs folk tunes from different sources and re-presents them in multiple forms that belong to different schools of zheng music. In this study, I examine the folk tunes of the Hakka and Chaozhou schools of zheng music, compare repertoires of the two schools, and highlight the common context where they originated. I also investigate the current state of their forms and characters, including musical forms, tunes, musical patterns, performing techniques and performing manners. In addition to exploring the characters of folk tunes of zheng music, I also probe into the musical texts and their circulation through analyzing the relations between different local musical genres. My study discovers that both the Hakka and Chaozhou zheng music were influenced by waijiang (other provinces) music and acquired folk tunes from diverse origins. From their separate ethnic musical background and aesthetic taste, individual features took shape. Based on my analysis, I conclude that, first; inclination of folk musicians to improvise on a set tune had caused musical forms and tunes to vary. Second, the differences in geographical, cultural and economical developmental background had conditioned the dissemination and preservation of zheng folk tunes in Hakka and Chaozhou music. Third, the inherence of musical genre and origins of these folk tunes are the most important factors that determined the zheng music's vocabulary and style. Fourth, cultural communication between Hakka and Chaozhou people are criti cal factors that contributed to their zheng music's shared tonal system. The above-mentioned historical and geographical factors and social influences resulted in the different forms and characters of zheng folk tunes of the Hakka and Chaozhou schools of music.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201406-201408040010-201408040010-155-227,184,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

However, parts of their repertoires do overlap. There are some Kunqu plays that are kept in the Peking Opera repertoires, mainly martial arts plays. The subject of this study highlights ＂song cycles＂ instead of Kunqu, because martial arts plays of Peking Opera feature both original Kunqu plays and new plays composed by Peking opera troupes. The term ＂song cycles＂ stresses the musical characteristics of the martial arts plays and explains why Kunqu performers, schooled by Peking Opera masters, were able to stage these plays and push ahead the eventual independence of martial arts roles sheng and dan. Although martial arts plays are not the most representative type of either Peking Opera or Kunqu, their history of performance and variety illustrate their vitality. I focus on the song cycles of martial arts plays to show their employment in Peking Opera and Kunqu, to shed lights on the development of cross-genre opera dissemination, and the significance of Kunqu martial arts plays. The discussions are in two parts. In the first part, I discuss the employment of song cycles, the origin, formula and structural layout of martial arts plays in Peking Opera. In the second part, I explain the succession of martial arts plays in Kunqu, their development and transformation from Peking Opera to Kunqu, to demonstrate that martial arts plays in contemporary Kunqu neither confine themselves to the Kunqu tradition nor follow precisely the Peking Opera model, but exhibits a specific sophistication and innovation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201406-201408040010-201408040010-229-278,184,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Religious Life of Contemporary Female Disciples of the Phoenix: A Case Study of Yuhua Tang in Puli,Ping-Ying Huang,"Puli, Yuhua tang, spiritwriting, phoenix halls, women's studies","There have been quite a few studies of phoenix halls in Taiwan. Yet rarely did they concentrate on the female disciples of the phoenix or their participation in the phoenix hall's matters. Phoenix halls constitute a majority of the sectarian religion in Puli. In these phoenix halls, the number of female disciples largely exceeds that of the males. Obviously, we need an in-depth investigation on the female disciples of phoenix to render a more comprehensive picture of the phoenix hall system. In this study, I investigate senior female disciples of phoenix in the Yuhua tang in Puli, Nantou to depict their religious life, hoping to contribute to our understanding of the phoenix halls and women's religious lives. I start with a general introduction of the Yuhua tang, describe the age and gender distribution of the disciples of the phoenix, their motivation to become such disciples, and their time of initiation. Secondly, I give an account of the induction of these senior phoenix hall disciples, their hardship of apprenticeship and moral cultivation, their joy of religious life. Through participatory observation of the Yuhua tang's regular activities, such as birthdays of general deities (for example, God of City and Moat), birthday of the main deity (Emperor Guan), and the 7th day of every lunar month (ritual day of the spirit-writing), I portray the circumstances of the disciples' participation, both male and female, and the gender differences in their religious practices. Finally, I comment on the ＂invisibility＂ of the female disciples of phoenix. One of their principle religious practices is reciting scripture. It is also the familiar stereo type the society as a whole regards senior woman. Perhaps just because of that, people ignore or disregard the importance of such practice. While the male disciples of phoenix almost never recite scripture, the diligent scripture-reciting of their counterparts is an important factor that complements their efforts in upholding the cult of the Enzhu (Benevolent Lord). To sum up, these senior women are able to reverse their disadvantaged societal status with their religious practices.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201406-201408040010-201408040010-279-334,184,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Practice of Incorporation in Society: A Case Study of a Spirit Medium's Life History,Hui-Yu Mei,"embodiment, social memory, tangki, Anping Tainan, incorporating practice","This article explores local Anping sociality with a systematic perspective as well as from an agent's point-of-view. I provide a thick description of the Anping phenomenon with scholarly discourse on social memory and concept of bodily practice. I offer a new attempt to inset Taiwanese society by exploring a spirit medium's (tangki) life history inset between personal experience and social tradition.I have followed the case as a participant observer for more than twenty years. The spirit medium, Phang-íng's impressive career, his posthumous apotheosis, and the rich ritual repertoire of the community embody Anping people's practice of the incorporation of the local tradition. The substance of the Anping local tradition is constituted by collective memory or recollection. Phang-íng's case of apotheosis is interpreted within the constructed context of social memory. His performance as a spirit medium is a result of the interaction between daily practice and local tradition. That places Phang-íng's personal narrative in a part of an interconnected narrative embedded in the group's collective identity memory. The case of Phang-íng illustrates how an individual and his group are interwoven, and how they represent the local tradition of a larger society.Due to individual variations, the local tradition does not remain unchanged. On the other hand, it is sustained because of the nature of the individual's community. The two sides maintain a dialectical inter-subjectivity. The Anping society is not a static one, but a constantly changing, evolving, and inter-determining entity, where the local people's past and collectivity are represented and constructed through incorporating practice.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201403-201404250011-201404250011-7-69,183,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

I induce from the devotees' pleas to the deities and responses from the spirit-writing, the role and function of characters in the village's supernatural world. The dialectic of the mutually defined relationship found between their function and religious activities offers a glimpse into the structural layout of Kinmen's folk religion built upon domestic daily worship and temple sacrifices. The structure usually remains well hidden under average people's daily worships and ritual customs, executed unknowingly, following the example of a public cult. This rarely mentioned or explained structure only manifests when a person pleads to the altar after some unusual occurrences. Through the spirit-writing, the yin/yang principle of the occurrence and the relations of the gods and ghosts involved are illuminated in context.Spirit mediums guide their bewildered visitors of the altar to visit temples or participate in rituals that pacify wandering souls. The visitors are instructed or led to comprehend the character and function of the ones worshipped. With the initiation of his or her religious cognition, the individual turns from a lay man into a believer.

I begin by discussing the distinction between the way and the technique as seen in scriptures written during the Song and Yuan dynasties. By focusing on how writers used these two terms, we arrive at a new understanding of the religious function of the way and the technique. I also incorporate fieldwork conducted in the Tainan region, especially the Heyitang Altar.Heyitang employs the black-head rituals belonging to Pu'an school. They are also affiliated with Lian Jicheng. Wang Yanshan established the Heyitang and there is now extensive cooperation between Wang Yanshan's Heyitang and other temples in Tainan. Chen Rongsheng and Wu Xigeng established new ritual model of daotan (Daoist altar) and fatan (technique altar) in order to foster deeper cooperation. In this process, the way and the technique are again fused together. The same practice has been carried out by Wang's successor, Wang Zhengyu.

"Transcription and Translation of Hmub Antique Songs: A Song Master's Manuscript, Knowledge, Space and Landscape",Mei-Ling Chien,"Southeast Guizhou, space and landscape, transcription, folklore, translation, Hmub","Following the legacy of Boas and Malinowski, ethnographic studies and writings are closely related to cross cultural construction of knowledge and cultural translation. Cultural translation is also embedded in the methodology of ethnography. Besides translation, there is also the task of transcription of the fieldwork. According to linguistic anthropologists, various versions of translation and transcription can be created or constructed from the sounds and voices. In line with such theoretical point of view this paper will explore the constitution of knowledge and the cultural space and landscape through the study of the manuscripts by an antique song master of the Hmub from Southeast Guizhou, and his transcription and translation works. Sangt Jingb, an educated song master of the Hmub, had experienced the Cultural Revolution in China and can write the Hmub language. I was learning Hmub antique songs from him for several months during my ethnographic fieldwork in Southeast Guizhou from 1999 to 2000. Sangt Jingb spent more than a decade to compile the Hmub antique songs that were circulated in Taijiang area of Southeast Guizhou. According to the topics of these songs he wrote twelve manuscripts. Travel Over Land and Water (Nangx Eb Jit Bil) was the third one. The two-hundred-page manuscript included paintings, cover page, summary, preface and one hundred and forty one folk songs. The nearly 2,000 lines of lyric of the antique songs were transcribed according to actual oral performance depicting the an cestors' migration from the north to Guizhou. On the left page of the manuscript was the Hmub language and on the right the meaning in Chinese. Although Sangt Jingb tried to achieve an accurate, clear and elegant translation, there were inconsistencies, which is intriguing, in some of his transcription and translation. The variations of the translation demonstrated the consciousness and the visibility of the translator. The lyrics of the antique songs and the life history of the song master are the two axes that form the analytic discussion base of this paper. It will discuss how the transcription and translation of the manuscript created the hybridity of the antique Hmub songs in the modern knowledge and cultural space, and the emergence of one single person who is a translator, a writer, an editor and also a song master.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201403-201404250011-201404250011-191-252,183,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Localization of Orphan Ghosts: The Youyinggong Temples and Changes in Geo-Consciousness of Taiwan Society,Wei-Hua Chen,"Youyinggong temple, orphan ghosts worship, localization, religious changes, geo-consciousness","The Youyinggong temples in Taiwan underwent two transformations from Qing dynasty to contemporary Taiwan, namely the localization and the deification of orphan ghosts. Both reflect significant social changes in society that are worthy of investigation. Based on historical documents and field investigation, I will define the first transformation from the perspective of ritual symbolism, hence confirm its existence. The characteristics of orphan ghost worship in Qing dynasty lies in its nature to ”sympathize with/pacify” the orphan ghosts, while during the Japanese Colonial rule, the worship highlights the ”yin responsive/wish-granting” aspect. A critical point of this transformation is that the image of the orphan ghosts in Qing dynasty demonstrates a strong intent to ”go home.” That image, however, is absent in the image of orphan ghosts in Youyinggong temples built after the Japanese Colonial years. This is what I called ”the localization of orphan ghosts.” I apply ritual symbolism to this phenomenon to offer a meaningful interpretation. I argue that the entire social atmosphere in the Japanese Colonial era had altered so that people no longer considered that the ”others” in society still longed for returning to mainland China. This change in social and communal relationships indicates a significant transformation in geo-consciousness in Taiwan. There are also orphan ghosts worship elsewhere in other ethnic-Han immigrant societies. Their differences possibly reflect changes in particular social structure or psychology that merit comparative studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201403-201404250011-201404250011-253-338,183,2014,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Sounding Taiwanese: A Preliminary Study on the Production Strategy of Taiwanese Records by Nippon Phonograph Company,Ying-Fen Wang,"Taiwanese Opera, Taiwan Columbia Records, Nippon Phonograph Company, pop songs, colonial Taiwan","Nippon Phonograph Company (Nitchiku) was the first among Japanese record company to import record industry into colonial Taiwan. From 1914 to 1943, it issued more than 2000 sides of Taiwanese records. Even though the metal discs of these records have been well preserved at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka, while the released records and their catalogues in the hands of record collectors, there remain very few documents about their production and release. Consequently past research on these records mostly focused on the products rather than the process.This paper uses three newly uncovered archival documents of Nitchiku to reconstruct the dates and locales of its recordings of Taiwanese music and to speculate on the strategy behind their production. These three documents include the recording ledgers, the recording log reports kept by the recording engineers, and the release orders. They are supplemented by information gained from the metal discs of the recordings, sound files, newspaper reports, photos, record labels, music scores, etc.Analysis of these diverse sources reveals that the recordings did not take place in Japan only but actually went through several stages, including Taipei (1926-1927), Taipei/Tokyo (1929-1931), Tokyo/Osaka (1932.3-1933.7), Tokyo (1933.8-9), Tokyo (1934.9-12), Taipei (1936, 1938), Tokyo (1939.5). The recordings in Taiwan and Japan exhibit obvious differences. The recordings in Taipei mostly featured traditional genres and musicians and hence were more diverse in their contents and involved a larger number of performers; moreover, the performance level of Western music was lower and the sound quality poorer. In contrast, those made in Tokyo/Osaka mostly featured pop songs and Taiwanese Opera sung by a core group of singers, with a higher level of performance of Western music and better sound quality.These findings suggest that the selection of the locales depended on the contents and desired sound quality of the recordings. When the recordings involved more Western music or required better sound quality, the recordings had to be done in Japan because of Taiwan's lack of musicians and arrangers of Western music and its poorer recording facilities and techniques. In order to reduce budget, the recordings were usually done in large batches (with the hundreds of pop songs recorded in three batches, namely August-September 1933, September to November 1934, and May 1939) and then released gradually in bits and pieces without following the original sequence of recordings. Moreover, in order to economize the manpower, each of the core group of performers had to be versatile enough to perform both pop and traditional genres, and, in doing so, the same singer was given different artistic names according to the genres and labels. This practice was unique to the recordings of Taiwanese music, as a way to adapt to the limited musical and technical resources of the record industry in colonial Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201312-201402070019-201402070019-7-58,182,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Through these notifications, among which precious official documents of internal circulation are also included, we know that Taiwan Columbia Record Company negotiated with its parent company, the Nippon Phonograph Co., over the standards of music selection.Although these ”notifications of music selection” were mainly sent by the Taiwan Columbia Selling Co. to Nippon Phonograph Co. for confirmation, we can read from the negotiations for more information over division of work, the demand for record quality and so on.This paper thus attempts to analyze these notifications and finds the following results: (1) the roles of Taiwan Columbia Selling Co. and the Nippon Phonograph Co. in the initiation of marketing plan of music records release, (2) the procedures of Taiwanese local music's production and release, (3) the influences of the contemporary situation upon album release, especially the official need for war-time propaganda.

Beards and Whiskers: On the Gender and Ritual of Ainu People in Hokkaido,Shih-Chung Hsieh,"persistent identity, symbol of beards, ancestral worship, Ainu People, population reproduction","The Ainu people are an indigenous people of Hokkaido, Japan. Despite an environment disadvantaged by long-term discriminations and assimilation policies, there remains in their society a mechanism that upholds Ainu identity. The mechanism, solid and yet slightly mysterious, hinges on the circumstances surrounding their ancestral offering rituals. Ancestral worship, limited interruption for nearly 150 years, is the well-maintained living Ainu culture during the era marked by political oppressions. Nowadays, even though several popular Ainu festivities are evidently tourism-oriented, they still conclude with a grand ancestral offering rite to proclaim their heritage. The ancestral offering rites, pregnant with meanings of continuity and regeneration, demonstrate religious objects and actions that are symbol of powerful reproduction. The entire family and patri-lineal kindred care for and nurture them, ensuring the perpetuation of their traditional worldview.The important religious symbol of curly bark strings called inau on a stick reflects the Ainu men's tradition to wear long beards. Women's tattoo around their mouths represents enlargement of the birth canal. Though not publicly represented in any corresponding rituals, the women's meticulous care of the soundness of inau sticks is self-evident. When people use supposedly home-made liquor to irrigate the long ancestral inau sticks and the shorter inau sticks of living males, the reproduction and prosperity of their entire population of a particular patrilineal group is guaranteed. In the rituals, potency and artistry of men's beard attest to the intimate relationship between the two sexes of the Ainu people.The continuity of Ainu ethnicity depends on the cultural tradition maintained over uncountable years, definitely instead of the sporadic ethnic campaigns or social movements. Although the Ainu people were prohibited from worshipping their deities since the day when Japanese began to colonize Hokkaido, they continued to worship their ancestors. It is the very foundation that confirms their persistence of ethnic identity. With attentive care, such a northern people with unclear origin help to preserve the fountain of life for an everlasting ethnic lifeline in bitterly cold territory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201312-201402070019-201402070019-99-148,182,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Cultural Contending: Kangxi Painted Enamelware as Global Competitor,Ching-Fei Shih,"painted enamel, Qing court, imperial household workshops, overglaze-enamel, Kangxi","The importation of painted enameling from Europe spurred the development of painted enamels at the Qing court during the late Kangxi era. The Enameling Atelier of the Office of Imperial Manufactories applied the new art form to at least four distinct media (bronze, glass, porcelain, and Yixing stoneware). Guided personally by the emperor, the atelier diligently experimented with new raw materials and technologies to create the distinctive category of imperial painted enamel. By reexamining the Western-style elements and documentary evidence of painted enameling at the Qing court, this paper argues that use of painted enameling by the imperial ateliers did not merely stem from what previous studies have interpreted as the imperial fascination with a new art form, but was in fact a serious attempt on the part of Emperor Kangxi to surpass the painted enamels of Europe and the traditional overglaze-enameled porcelains developed in the Ming dynasty.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201312-201402070019-201402070019-149-219,182,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Japanese Imperial Universities with Baroque-Style Campus Landscape, from Tokyo to Taipei",Lan-Shiang Huang,"colonial university, modern university, Japanese colonization, Baroque spatial campus, modern architecture","Commentaries on the campus landscape and architecture of Taiwan University have long disagreed on two diametric fronts, one that criticizes it for being the intellectual base camp for Japanese militarists' south-bound invasion; another considers it the humanism symbol of Taiwan University today. Faculty and students of Taiwan University are caught in the paradox for nearly seventy years. So far there has not been a positive attempt to negotiate a consensus. I have gone through archives and documentations before WWII that record the process of imperial university chartering and landscape designing, hoping to clarify the issue.I will argue that, either Tokyo Imperial University in the suzerain or the Taipei Imperial University in the colony followed the same path to establish a modern university by annexing extant technology colleges that featured a curriculum based on western civilization. In addition, both imperial universities applied the western Baroque style to their campus landscaping.With its dominant sovereignty, the Japanese government introduced the concept of a contemporary university and the model of a Baroque-style campus landscape to Taiwan. Their political hegemony not only made the new type of university even more feasible in Taiwan, but also extended the spatial order that had been limited to a smaller scale in Japan to one that was both enormously authoritative and superhuman.At the conclusion of my investigation, I have found that the post-War Taiwan University lengthened the original east-west axis of the Imperial Taipei University without a prior integral plan. It was possibly that there was an attempt to reorganize the disjointed campus space by emphasizing the medial status of the axis. This indicates that although post-War Taiwanese condemned the colonial rule, they were not opposed to a campus with classic Baroque spatial features. This case of the Baroque campus space illustrates how an artistic paradigm takes shape, is disseminated and transformed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201312-201402070019-201402070019-221-301,182,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Interpretation and Misinterpretation of Folk Pictures: A Case Study of the Zhong Kui Pictures Held in Russian Museums,Yu-Jun Yang,"five demons, Duanwu, woodblock prints, Zhong Kui, lubok","During the decades that bridged the 19th and 20th century, individual Russians acquired a considerable number of Chinese woodblock prints, for reasons which remain largely unexplored. It is the purpose of this essay to re-trace the history of these acquisitions. I will begin by giving an account of the historical development of Russian woodblock prints. I will then describe how the late 19th century Russian nationalism helped to arouse the interest of intellectuals in Russian folk woodblock prints. Given this background, Russian travelers to China began to purchase Chinese folk woodblock prints. Two notable Russian sinologists who were involved in woodblock print collection and research are Vasily M. Alexeyev and Boris L. Riftin.Despite their enthusiasm, the intellectuals who collected folk prints did not always comprehend their meanings. In the process of deciphering folk imagery one often observes a tendency toward capricious speculation on the part of intellectuals that has little to do with the context of folk culture. Two sets of ”Demons Frolicking with Zhong Kui” purchased by Alexeyev, currently held in the State Museum of History of Religion, serve as an illuminating example. After this acquisition, Alexeyev asked his Chinese teachers to write down the meanings of the pictures and had the notes attached to the back of the pictures. These notes frequently misinterpret the significance and betrays the Chinese intellectuals' poor understanding of and demeaning attitude toward folk culture. Drawing on comparisons with the Russian lubki, I will investigate such misinterpretations, point out the dilemma of folk picture interpretation, and propose one way of reading and deciphering folk pictures.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201309-201311010025-201311010025-223-264,181,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Improvisation in Taiwan's Puppet Theater,Long-Ting Chen,"puppet theater, improvised performance, character, oral tradition, scenario","Generally speaking, there is no specific ”script” (according to the western concept) in Taiwanese Puppet Theater. In that case, how the creation process of Puppet Theater is carried out poses one curious question. When the Puppet Theater follows its own ”improvised performance” tradition, there obviously exists a certain formula. In this study, I start with the notion of improvised performance and based on my past research I offer to elucidate the source of creativity in Taiwanese folk theater. I shall attempt to reconstruct a different aesthetic perspective for the folk theater, and endow it with a certain value.Each of the improvised performances all over the world derives from different historical backgrounds. The commedia delľarte of 16th century Italy is considered by most people to be a paradigm. The improvisational drama includes a basic scenario that allows plot expansion or reduction when circumstances arise, an actor/actress-centered performance, a fixed cast for characters, and a play composed of limited types of characters.I will center my discussion on factors of the improvised performance, such as actor/actresses, scenario, and characters. Drawing cases from Taiwanese Puppet Theater for analysis, I intend to sort out features of such improvised performances. I will first review extensively the plot guidelines of Taiwanese Puppet Theater, point out the significance of leaving gaps in performance arts, and explicate the elements of improvised performance with character semantics. Finally, I will focus on the personality and thespian talents of the leading puppeteers and their influence on improvised performances. This study is inspired by theories of Ferdinand de Saussure, father of modern linguistics. I propose notions of character semantics, with the hope to further illuminate the subtlety of improvised performance of Taiwanese Puppet Theater.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201309-201311010025-201311010025-5-48,181,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"A Study on the Improvisational Performance in Taiwanese Luantan (Beiguan) Theater of ""Tuan-a-hi""",Hsiu-Jen Jian,"performer, Taiwan luantan theater, improvisational performance, repertory","Judging from extant studies and the oral information given by the performers of the Taiwanese luantan (beiguan) theater, it has been held that the improvisational performance used to exist in Taiwanese luantan theater. This type of performance is frequently known as ”tuān-á-hì,” which was based on a scenario chart and was opposed to ”tsiànn-pún-hi,” performed in accordance with an oral-derived text. In the paper, I review extant scholarship and collect more performers' opinions to redefine the term ”tuān-á-hì.” At the same time, I try to discuss the relation between the actor's training background and their performance on stage. I also analyze how the actors cooperate with the orchestra and handle the techniques of the improvisational acting.The differences of the audiences' tastes, the venues for the performances, the actors' training background all influenced the performances of ”tuān-á-hì.”Before the 1970s, in the west part of Taiwan, the troupes of luantan theater played in indoor theaters or temples for more than 10 days each time, so they frequently connected some episodes from both ”tuān-á-hì” and ”tsiànn-pún-hi” to compose a long play which was performed in series. However, in the region of Yilan, the troupes didn't link the two types of drama because the duration of a performance was generally less than three days and the performances accompanied the celebrations held at temples.Having analyzed the matinee's repertory of the Hanyang Beiguan Troupe in Yilan since 1974, we find that the chance to perform ”tuān-á-hì” increases after the 1970s. The traditional troupes playing in Yilan used to ”perform the beiguan theater for matinee,” but, at that time, few actors were trained by luantan troupes. As a result, most of the actors had to come from other theatrical troupes, and sometimes these actors even added new types of drama to enrich the repertory of ”Hanyang.” In this case, the ”beiguan theater” probably contained the music of siping theater, Peking opera and beiguan theater in one play.From the development of the ”tuān-á-hì” of beiguan theater, we can find how the Taiwanese luantan theater made efforts to survive in a changing world.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201309-201311010025-201311010025-49-96,181,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"On the Foundation of Improvisation in Taiwanese Koa-á Opera: ""Genuine Koa-á,"" Shanbo and Yintai",Hsin-Hsin Tsai,"""genuine koa-á"", Shanbo and Yintai, improvisation, cham thâu (performance routines), chhah khek (episodic aria)","When senior performers of Taiwanese Koa-á Opera recalled their early years of apprenticeship, they often mentioned a manuscript of ”genuine koa-á,” which was passed down in their troupes from generation to generation. The genuine koa-á had to be memorized by heart and practiced constantly. It was regarded as the essential training for theatrical competence (such as reciting, rhyming, singing, and acting) that nourished a performer's virtuosity and artistry to improvise. The ”genuine koa-á” originated from ”koa-á chheh” (a booklet of koa-á verses used for acting and singing), with the traditional narrative form of ”sì-kù-liân” (the ”four verse stanza” for singing and reciting). It was integrated with the performers' artistry and expertise and gradually became texts with fixed plots, accompanying music and lyrics. Among these texts, the ”kóo lōo” repertoire (historical drama and stories of heroes) and the ”bûn” repertoire (lyrical drama) are the more important ones. With the keen competition within the ”indoor stage” Taiwanese Folk Opera after WWII, the troupes further developed a new type of ”genuine koa-á” that featured eight-verse stanzas, composed by the performers themselves or professional playwrights.This study analyzes several episodic arias (chhah khek) from the ”genuine koa-á” Shanbo and Yintai. The performers make use of these episodic arias when circumstances call for refined acting or humorous effect. Alternatively, the episodic arias serve to complement certain scenario or specific type-scene. Either lyrical or narrative, they become components of performance formulas (cham thâu). When a performer masters the content of cham thâu and has them imprinted mentally, he or she can apply them onto related or similar drama plots.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201309-201311010025-201311010025-97-166,181,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Innovations in telling scriptures discussed in this article encompass three aspects: (1) the changes in organization, length, and elements of assemblies; (2) the composition of new texts and revision of old texts; (3) the growing entertaining aspect of performances. I distinguish between the historical changes that occurred in telling scriptures in general after its revival in the 1980s-1990s and the self-conscious innovations introduced by Yu Dingjun since the year 2000.

"A Mountain Love Song between Cross Cultural Couples: A Study of the Origin and Imagined Identity of ""The Maiden of Malan""",Chun-Yen Sun,"Zhuang Qisheng, Shen Zhi, ""The Love of Malan"", ""The Maiden of Malan"", Lu Jingzi","”The Maiden of Malan,” possibly the best-known modern Amis popular song, tells about the romance of an Amis maiden. A famous rendering of this song is recorded by an Amis singer Lu Jingzi, from Malan, Taidong. Ethnomusicologists have since collected several very similar tunes. Considering the prevalence of the album and the folk singers' tendency to improvise, they were taken to be derivations from Lu Jingzi's recording. However, field investigation and studies of the rhythm and lyrics indicate otherwise. Lu Jingzi's interpretation might not be original, nor did the song come from Malan. ”The Maiden of Malan” has been adapted into mandarin and Taiwanese versions, used as theme songs for TV series, film and fiction that feature a romance between an aboriginal maiden and a Han young man. Because of the popularity of this song, there are several cover versions. The current Amis version of ”The Maiden of Malan” was possibly influenced by the mandarin version; its rhythm and lyrics are different from those of the earlier one. In addition to its pleasant tune, creative adaptation by Han musicians, lyric writers, and dramatists all contribute to the success of ”The Maiden of Malan.” They constructed an imagined world of the aboriginal people that in turn influenced the aboriginal people's self-identity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201309-201311010025-201311010025-265-319,181,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Musical Time and Cultural Heterogeneity: Recordings of ""Xuemei Si Jun"" during and around the 1930s",Yuh-Wen Wang,"musical modernity, linear, cultural universalism, early Taiwanese popular songs, circular, cyclical","Recent decades have seen important debates in musical time. Many scholars have argued for linearity as characteristic of Western art music (WAM), and non-linearity as characteristic of other musics. This position is recently attacked seriously for making dichotomous division among all cultures of music. Discussion of musical time in terms of cultural heterogeneity is thus discouraged. This study agrees, on the one hand, the problem in making dichotomous distinction of ”linear time associated with WAM” and ”non-linear time associated with non-WAM.” On the other hand, it argues that refined comparison in time processes not only brings insights into musical universality but also to heterogeneity. Through analyzing different recordings of a tune widely popular in Taiwan during and around the 1930s, ”Xuemei Si Jun” (Xuemei Longs for Her Beloved), I demonstrate how various degrees of circularity and linearity occur in relation to the relatively traditional or westernized overall styles respectively. Musical time is thus significant not only in terms of cultural universality but also heterogeneity. The latter may even bring insights to musical modernity, as the last section of this essay illustrates.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201306-201307220035-201307220035-1-43,180,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Lost Historiography of Xi'an: Investigating the Imaginative Spatial Construction of the Historic Daming Palace (National Heritage Park),Meng-Chi Hsueh,"Daming Palace of the Tang dynasty, conservation of urban heritage site, urban history of Xi'an, historiography, Tang royal city renaissance scheme","The historiography about Chang'an (in present-day Xi'an, Shaanxi) has been mainly about the city's imperial past of the Tang dynasty or earlier stages (before the end of the 9th century AD). Not being the capital anymore, Chang'an after the Tang dynasty was out of the literati's and scholars' attention. In the writing of Xi'an's urban history, time seems to halt as we see recalling or imagining the remote past while disregarding immediate transformation. The way history has been compiled and narrated significantly influences the practice of heritage conservation today. In the year of 2005, the municipality of Xi'an initiated the ”Tang royal city renaissance scheme” aiming at revitalizing the stigmatized ”stagnant and sleepy” city of Xi'an by remodeling it after the flourishing yet distant empire. More than a span of one millennium in-between was intentionally skipped. The remodeling of Daming Palace, one of grand Tang's political cores, is an obvious example of this revitalization movement. Within three years, the former palace has been transformed into a gigantic Tang-themed urban heritage park from sites of slums, urban villages, factories, and dumping grounds. With the execution of the heritage site conservation and heritage park construction, ironically, the history of the Mongolians, the Muslins, refugees from He'nan province and other disadvantaged minorities was carefully wiped out. The official wording of ”conservation” in this case implies the action of selecting favorable memories. This article analyzes the reasons why certain ethnic groups and specific periods of history were deliberately excluded, and demonstrates the necessity to reveal the undesirable past. Instead of regarding Xi'an as being inactive and still, this article emphasizes the perspective of motion and dynamics for better elaborating on the long-term spatial transformation. From observing the direction, velocity and capacity of people and materials moving in and out of the site, this article finds that Daming palace represents the epitome of the changing strategic position of Xi'an city within the whole country.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201306-201307220035-201307220035-45-81,180,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"A Comparative Study of ""She Guan"" in Jiaoling, Guangdong and Meinong, Taiwan",Hsin-Lan Hung,"Li She Zhen Guan, Gong Wang, Bogong (earth god), Jiaoling, Meinong","Extant studies on ”She Guan” in Chinese society mainly depict it as a type of sheji (earth and grains) fertility cult in ancient history. Compared to the common worship of earth god (Fude Zhengshen), one important feature of ”She Guan” is the joint worship by civilians and officials above the township level. There has been no consensus in contemporary folk researches on the transformation of ”She Guan” after people emigrated from the Lingnan region to Taiwan. According to the field data from Meinong, Taiwan, in the 1730s early Hakka settlers came to the foothill plains to farm wet rice paddies. Until today, there are still three (and only three) ”Li She Zhen Guan Tan” that house ”She Guan” in Taiwan. However, due to the lack of comparative studies between Meinong and their Hakka hometown in Jiaoling and Meisian in Guangdong, local historians tend to view ”She Guan” as a type of Fude Zhengshen (Tudi Bogong). This study conducts field research in Jiaoling County in Guangdong, one of the native places of the Hakka in Meinong, Kaohsiung. Two points of discussion are, first, aspects of continuity in the cult of ”She Guan” both in the native place and overseas; second, individual localized features. ”She Guan” in Jiaoling seems to have been affected by characteristics of the local Gong Wang cult. As a hybrid between Gong Wang and She Guan, it presides over both water ghosts (bodies of water) and officialdom in the yang/living world, whose altars were often erected close to water. This culturally syncretic cult was brought to Meinong, Taiwan, early in the Qing dynasty, and then accepted into the Tudi Bogong cult in the settlers' society. The cult then incorporated Bogong sacrificial rites, gradually forming a merger of ”Gong Wang/She Guan.” This is an exploration of ”rediscovering” local history in a retroactive research. For Meinong, the tradition of ”She Guan” originated from its native place is an interesting issue. It also demonstrates a cultural encounter phenomenon with the popular Tudi Bogong cult in Hakka areas in Taiwan. In addition, this study also uses the topographical waterfront feature of ”She Guan” altars to track down the ecological history of the settlements' geographic evolution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201306-201307220035-201307220035-83-130,180,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

One wonders why the ritual sphere excluded three other such village alliances, the 13 village alliances of Zhongli to the north, the Toufen Yimin sphere to the south, and the Hakka villages in Miaoli. In this study, I use data from the 1926 ”Survey of Ethnic-Han Taiwanese's Ancestral Registry” conducted by the Japanese government to investigate why the Fangliao ritual sphere was limited to the 14 village alliances. I will argue that reasons for the limitation lie in the different immigrant groups' ancestral domiciles and their respective Hakka dialects. While Chaozhou (speaking in Raoping or Dapu dialects) and Huizhou Hakka (Hailu dialect) people dominated the Fangliao 14 village alliances, the Jiaying Hakka descents remained a minority within. The three village alliances not included in the Fangliao Yimin Temple's ritual sphere are mainly of Jiaying descents.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201306-201307220035-201307220035-131-164,180,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

During the Qianlong reign, ethnic-Han settlements dominated downtown Tamsui. With the development of markets and streets, immigrant groups from different regions established their separate temples. The Fuyou Temple became the largest and most important cult center. Circumstances changed after the Sino-French War. During the war, French troops took the economically and strategically important Tamsui as the major battleground. In this local society, which had rarely been attacked by large-scale military force before, the new ways of battle-fighting and the French marine's siege of Taiwan Strait affected the residents' daily lives and economic activities. To cope with these circumstances, residents found their solace in popular belief. The locals constructed oral legends mixed with historical facts that attribute success of battles to the help of certain deities. A particularly notable example is the elevated status of Master Clear Water (Qingshui Zushi). Legends that feature deities who helped with military actions since early Qing dynasty indicate the regime's intention to defend its legitimacy. The imperial plaque bestowed by Emperor Guangxu, in particular, enhanced the marvelous aspect of local legends. In this study, I analyze the narratives regarding Master Clear Water's dropping his nose and his help with various battles, and investigate the development of Master Clear Water's cult, as well as the factors contributing to the re-construction of cult in late Qing Tamsui local society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201306-201307220035-201307220035-165-215,180,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
A Tentative Interpretation of a Pingpu Custom,Ming-Hung Chien,"smallpox, Christianity, Pingpu, baptism, custom","When the Qing dynasty officials traveled to Taiwan, the exotic cultural phenomena of the aboriginal people became a favorite theme in their writings. Customs of the Pingpu ”tamed aboriginals,” in particular, were cited repeatedly in essays or anecdotal anthologies. Remarks of natives in Taiwan bathing after childbirth were offered in the Ming Wanli era. This Pingpu custom that goes against the Han practice had been documented throughout the Qing dynasty. Many of the writers emphasized that the Pingpu people believed that bathing in streams drove away evil spirits and diseases, and that it had become part of their culture. Though the Pingpu traditional culture and belief could have adapted to the actual changes of living environments, private anecdotes and correspondences indicate that belief in the efficacy of bathing might have been influenced by Christianity introduced during the Dutch era. I have since combed through the Spanish and Dutch archives between 1624 and 1662, and learned that the background of this custom appears to be related to the epidemic of smallpox, and that the traditional Pingpu cognition of diseases have integrated the Christianity concepts of disease. Due to various reasons, the correct Christianity notion (of baptism) failed to instill into the Pingpu cognitive thinking. After the Spanish and Dutch left Taiwan, the Pingpu people turned this altered cognition of diseases into their collective memory and daily custom. I argue that the Pingpu people confuse Christian ritual of baptism with the folklore of water's purifying power. They developed an imitative practice accordingly. It has become one distinguishing feature of writings about aboriginal customs since the Qing dynasty.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201306-201307220035-201307220035-217-274,180,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Their painting works are highly skilled and have a delicate and elegant style. Although none of Kuo clan's descendants currently continues to take up painting work, the Kuo clan's contributions to Taiwan's traditional house paintings are still extraordinary.This article is to study the human figures in the house painting works by the Kuo clan from 1866 to 1958. We have undertaken a field study and literature comparison to investigate into the human figures' themes, contents, and sources. Three dimensions are included: (1) to investigate into Kuo clan's house works from 1866 to 1958, the founders' backgrounds, and the themes of the human figures in the paintings; (2) to conclude the contents of the human figures; (3) to investigate the sources and applications of the model paintings or drawings for the human figures.By investigating the above three dimensions, we believe that not many of the Kuo's human figure works have specific themes that emblem the house owners' backgrounds or the purposes of the paintings. Although the works have adopted traditional model paintings, the works have their own personal styles but are not literal imitations. These works require valuable art skills that can establish characteristics of a Taiwan's house painting school and form a foundation of architectural esthetics.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201303-201305030021-201305030021-1-74,179,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Image, Representation, and Commodity: Contemporary Manifestations of Flying Fish Culture among the Tao in Orchid Island",Cheng-Hsien Yang,"commodity, image, representation, Orchid Island, flying fish","The Kuroshio, passing by Orchid Island, has rendered the island rich in marine resources, including migratory fishes such as ”flying fish” (Cheilopogon) and ”dolphin fish” (Coryphaena hippurus). Flying fish are not only an important marine resource and cultural food, but also commonly used for gift exchange in local society. From the Kuroshio fishery, the Tao people developed such ocean cultural tradition as a seafood diet, fish-based social exchange, and a unique ”people-fish network”. Historically, the Tao of Orchid Island place much importance on the flying fish and the related festivities. They even perceive the ocean and distinguish between seasons from the perspective of flying fish. In this paper, I will introduce the historical context of traditional ”people-fish network” among the Tao. By examining the cultural mechanisms of deification, personification, and commodification of the flying fish, I intend to analyze the varied implications of flying fish as symbols (divinity), representations (ethnicity), and commodities (commerce). The following aspects of flying fish culture will be investigated: first, the cultural image of origin myth about the fish and the Tao; second, the ethnic artistic representation of the fish portrayed in public or modern arts; third, the functional diversion of the fish into monetary economy and market mechanism. Eventually, this article attempts to further illuminate the contemporary significance and cultural landscape of flying fish on Orchid Island.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201303-201305030021-201305030021-75-121,179,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"""Spontaneous Performance"" in Taiwanese Opera in the Context of Improvisational Theater: Artistic Position, Research Perspective, and Dramatic Practice",Ho-Yi Lin,"Taiwanese Opera, improvisational theater, mu-biao-xi, commedia dell'arte, spontaneous performance","Among the many Oriental dramatic forms, Taiwanese Opera is the one that actually practices spontaneous performance with its ”mu-biao-xi”(scenario-based performances). In fact, many local dramatic forms used to adopt ”mu-biao-xi” for scripts and stage performances. In 1951, to reinforce political propaganda by means of drama, China promoted ”dramatic innovation” with policies that discouraged performances of ”mu-biao-xi” through negative commentary, which hastened the disappearance of such performance art in China. In Taiwan, to uplift the artistic level of Taiwanese Opera, those who work in the field insist on the refinement of Taiwanese Opera techniques and have long had a suspicious regard for ”mu-biao-xi” which is performed outdoors at temple festivals. As a matter of fact, the writing, creation, and performance of ”mu-biao-xi” serves both to present and cultivate actors’ skills. This dramatic mechanism of writing and creating developed among thepeople is a precious resource of Taiwanese drama that calls for preservation and more consideration.This study evaluates ”mu-biao-xi” by exploring the possible origin of ”mu-biao-zhi” (mechanism of the scenario-based performances) in Taiwanese Opera, tracing the beginnings and evolution of ”mu-biao-xi” in drama, and examining the history of and recent developments in improvisational theater in the West with references from Western academia and drama studies concerning their attitude and research on improvisational theater. At this point, I explore the significance of ”mu-biao-xi” as an artistic form in Taiwanese Opera, the research dimensions of its performance, and the possibilities of its dramatic practice.This study first presents the history of improvisational theater in both Chinese and Western drama and the origin of ”mu-biao-xi.” Then it analyzes the three developments of contemporary improvisational theater and points out the position of ”mu-biao-xi” of Taiwanese Opera in the improvisational theater of both Eastern and Western drama and its contemporary development. Next, within the scope of ”mu-biao-xi,” contrasting Italian ”commedia dell'arte,” a most distinctive form of Western ”mu-biao-xi,” and Taiwanese Opera clearly reveals the artistic characteristics of form of Western ”mu-biao-xi,” and Taiwanese Opera clearly reveals the artistic characteristics of the ”mu-biao-xi” of Taiwanese Opera. Finally, the study examines related works and views on the ”mu-biao-xi” of Taiwanese Opera by applying Western academic and theater research and practice on ”mu-biao-xi” and other forms of improvisational theater, and explores the possibility of combining such performances with contemporary stage performances.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201303-201305030021-201305030021-123-184,179,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Never Go to Nanyang? The Historical Memories and Exhortation in the Keh-huan-gua from Southern Fujian,Jung-San Ke,"Min-nan culture, Nanyang, loh-huan, overseas Chinese, keh-huan-gua","Keh-huan (migration overseas) is the common memories of overseas Chinese from coastal provinces. Many of their forefathers migrated to Southeast Asia (Nanyang) in search of a living. In their native hometowns as well as their destination countries, there circulated many keh-huan-gua (songs of migration overseas) that narrate these emigrants' bitterness of a life torn away from one's homeland. Min-nan (Southern Fujian) has been one such renowned homeland for many overseas Chinese. Naturally keh-huan-gua abound. Some of the huan-kheh (emigrants) labored under harsh conditions, yet still fell short of making ends meet. In their despondence, they eventually returned home and lamented, ”Never go to Nanyang,” ”It's not true that livelihood is easy overseas.” In historical records, however, the facts appear to be in sharp contrast to such pleas. In this essay, I investigate and analyze the historical memories and messages of exhortation in the keh-huan-gua. The hardships and challenges such emigrants had to encounter also hit their families in hometown hard and shattered many emigrants' dreams. In the keh-huan-gua, also known as Coolie Songs of the Chinese Laborers, the emigrant narrator exhorts his fellow countrymen never ever go to Nanyang. However, when we look into the lyrics closely, we come to realize one critical fact, i.e., ”If you have no relatives to help you, don't ever go to Nanyang.” In other words, supposing one has relatives or friends in Nanyang, support from this chain-migration network would make his expedition, instead of bitter, rather promising.Therefore, the more convincing exhortation in these keh-huan-gua lies in a wife's caution to her husband travelling abroad, ”Let me advise you three things, abstain from alcohol, women and gambling,” and in contrast, the prodigal son's remorse over his debaucheries.In such light, the keh-huan-gua offer constructive advice and admonishments for the hopeful emigrants. It also indicates a weakening of the traditional notion that urges one to stay put instead of venturing afar.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201303-201305030021-201305030021-185-222,179,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"On the ""Seven-star Board""",Ming-Liang Hsieh,"""Yanshi jiaxun"", ""seven-star board"", cult of the Northern Dipper","Yan Zhitui (A.D. 531–589) of the Northern Qi dynasty had instructed in his will that the ”seven-star board” be used in his mortuary rites. The ”seven-star board” was placed at the bottom of the coffin, upon which the body was laid. With the aid of literary sources and latest archaeological discoveries, this article aims at sorting out the history of ”seven-star board” as well as other seven-star images decorated on the inner coffin. The preliminary results indicate that earliest instance of images of the Dipper on the coffin boards appeared in the Western Han tombs. However, extant cases of the ”seven-star board” used underneath the body can only be found at a later date. The reason is probably due to the incidental nature of archeological finds. The seven-star image used in burials is related to the cult of the Northern Dipper. It is believed that the Northern Dipper is in charge of death and capable of expelling evil spirits. Meanwhile, the Dipper is also a pointer used to determine time, season and directions. Therefore, round holes lined in the contour of the Dipper are sometimes drilled into the sailboat keels and inlaid with copper or iron coins.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201303-201305030021-201305030021-223-243,179,2013,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Pan Rongzhi's Nanguan Crossovers in the 1930s in Colonial Taiwan,Ying-Fen Wang,"record, fusion, Pan Rongzhi, nanguan, radio","The 1930s was the golden age of music industry in colonial Taiwan. It saw the boom of records and radio as well as of Taiwanese opera and pop songs. How did traditional musicians in Taiwan respond to these changes and negotiate between the old and the new? To answer this question, I will use Pan Rongzhi (1905-1947), one of the leading nanguan musicians at the time, as an example to examine how he crossed musical boundaries through his involvement with radio and record industry.On radio, besides playing traditional nanguan pieces, Pan also jammed with beiguan musicians to perform beiguan pieces and to accompany Taiwanese drama. He also conducted an ensemble featuring modified Chinese instruments to play Han Chinese music and pop songs. One of the radio programs even featured a nanguan-style pop song, Zhengyuenao (Festive January), that Pan created both as the lyricist and the composer.As an arranger for records, Pan not only produced records of traditional nanguan songs but he also created new nanguan songs to be included on records of Taiwanese operas and of spoken drama. He also blended nanguan instruments with other Han Chinese and western ones to accompany a song he adapted from Taiwanese opera. Most importantly, he composed a pop song that cleverly incorporated nanguan elements with Tango-like dance rhythm, thus resulting in an interesting mixture of nanguan and Jazz.Despite his innovative experiments to fuse nanguan with other genres, however, Pan adhered to the principle of playing nanguan with nanguan instruments only, albeit sometimes changing its instrumentation. Similarly, he also followed the traditional way of composing new nanguan songs by setting new text to existing nanguan tunes. In other words, Pan was bold to infiltrate nanguan into other genres but kept other genres from invading nanguan.Thus, Pan's choice between change and non-change provides us with a good example of how traditional musicians in colonial Taiwan crossed musical boundaries and adapted to the challenges as well as opportunities brought by sound technology.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201212-201302050006-201302050006-25-73,178,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"""The Road to Formosan Primo Bass Singer"": Stages of Hong Yi-feng's Singing Style",Wan-Ting Chiu,"singing style, Primo Bass Singer, historical recording, Taiwanese pop songs, Hong Yi-feng","From the 1950's to the 1970's, Hong Yi-feng and Wen Hsia were the two representative male singers of Taiwanese pop songs and were hailed as the ”Primo Bass Singer” and the ”Primo Tenor Singer” respectively. However, my analysis of Hong's historical recordings shows that his bass timbre had undergone a process of evolution and that his singing styles went through four stages of development. In the first stage (1957-1964), Hong's singing covered high, middle and low registers without stressing the bass in particular, and some of his repertoires overlapped with those of Wen Hsia; this implies that Hong was still swaying between the audiences' preferences for tenor timbre and his characteristic bass timbre during this period. Hong changed his timbre at the second stage (1964-1969) and began selecting songs which could feature his bass singing. In the third stage (1969-1973), Hong's timbre showed a greater unity and emphasized his bass timbre. As for the fourth stage (1973-1978), he developed a new singing style which not only combined the former singing styles but also added some new features. Correspondingly I found that the titles with which the media referred to Hong also went through stages, first as ”Bass Singer,” then as ”Primo Bass Singer,” and finally as ”Formosan Primo Bass Singer,” a change that more or less reflects the gradual shifting of the audience's taste from preferring tenor quality to accepting Hong's bass timbre.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201212-201302050006-201302050006-75-162,178,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Deemed to be the source of power and liveliness in the aboriginal culture, it encapsulates the dynamics of active participation, multicultural fusion, and the mass sharing of content; it overcomes social stratification and pervades the daily life of all members. Its production reflects the symbolic power at work in the Taiwanese society, embodying the complex multiethnic history of politics, economy, and culture. In other words, aboriginal ”mountain music” mutates in response to the evolving economic and political climate, hence developing very diverse aesthetic characters, and a chronological account of this music simultaneously reflects the history of contemporary aboriginal life. For this reason, studying the social history of this music is one of the more efficacious ways of acquiring genuine appreciation of aboriginal societies and their historical developments. However, to date, there have been few such studies. Using the aboriginal ”mountain songs” issued on records from the 1960s to the 1970s as the basis, this paper compares the record production and competition among three major labels, namely ”Ling-ling,” ”Chun-hsing” and ”Hsin-hsin,” and addresses the interactions among audience's taste, profit-seekers' music production, and musical identity. It describes the marketing mechanism of aboriginal ”mountain songs” from the 1960s to the 1970s and the re-emergence of aesthetic symbols. It also discusses how the changes of the auditory habits and the social environment among generations of aboriginal people feed back on music production and identity making.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201212-201302050006-201302050006-163-205,178,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

For example, Kurosawa Takatomo's LP set of Taiwanese Aboriginal music (published in 1974) based on the results of his 1943 survey was reissued on CDs in 2008, along with the book Listening to the Colony: Kurosawa Takatomo and the Wartime Survey of Formosan Music (1943) by Wang Ying-fen. The recordings of Amis music made at Hualien in the Folksong Collection Movement in 1967 were reissued on a two-CD set, accompanying a book edited by Wu Rong-shun et al. and published by Taiwan Music Center in 2010. This book is titled ”Return to Tribal Villages/Representation of Sounds: Professor Hsu Tsang-houei's Classic Historical Recordings Collection 1: On Music of the Amis in Hualien County” (hereafter ”Return to Tribal Villages”). These CD sets allow us to examine the results of studies on Taiwanese Aboriginal music conducted by pioneer scholars. Wang Ying-fen calls this kind of examination ”restudy.” In her book Listening to the Colony, she deals with reflexivity issues in Taiwan's musicology based on a restudy of the results of Kurosawa's research. In contrast, as the accompaniment of the 1967 field recordings, the book ”Return to Tribal Villages” does not concern relevant theories and methodology; rather, authors of this book pay attention to gather and sort out materials related to the recordings. In this paper, I would like to restudy ”Return to Tribal Villages”, and, furthermore, to rethink folksong studies in Taiwan, based on this restudy. I will begin with musical examples in the book as well as the accompanying CDs, and compare the recordings of the 1967 Folksong Collection with commercial recordings issued in the 1960s. By so doing, I discuss relationships between ”folksong” and ”popular song,” examine the construction of scholarly tradition of folksong studies, and consider the possible development of this tradition in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201212-201302050006-201302050006-207-271,178,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Ritual Character and Dance System: A Study on the Types of Falangaw New Year Ritual Dances,Chun-Yen Sun,"song and dance, gender distinction, daily life, Amis, ritual","Amis dances are usually classified into two categories: the ritual dance malikuda, and malakacaw/misalokiaw, commonly performed in festivity occasions for recreational purposes. The two kinds of dances were once considered to be male and female dance repertoires respectively, evincing a gender antithetical perspective. However, there are also researches which suggest a mix of ritual and recreational dances in daily life. Based on my observation of the New Year's rituals from 2000 to 2011, I will study the Amis dances of the Falangaw area according to their ritual structure and character then attempt to interpret their meanings. This article argues that, although malikuda and malakacaw both occur during the New Year's rituals, they are not staged arbitrarily. In fact, malikuda are performed during religious rituals, whereas malakacaw appear in social activities. Nevertheless, malikuda could serve a social function and malakacaw a ritual one. As for the gender distinction, an activity called pawsa shows that kinship organization and the male age status interact frequently in the Amis society could not be studied separately. Regardless of one's gender, though with various degree of involvement, everyone participates in the performance of malikuda and malakacaw, resulting in a union of the songs and dances.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201209-201211010038-201211010038-1-55,177,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

By observing the manifold ways of local temples' inviting and interacting with the ancestor temple, we can realize the function for hierarchy of deities in Chinese folk religion. Several important concepts: ”the complex of ancestor-branch temple,” ”mediating transformer between ancestor temple and branch temples,” ”self-differentiation within lineage complex,” ”publicity embodying in geographical layout,” all are heuristic tools for us to understand the dynamic of Han folk religion. Besides the rather stable structural relations among temples of different levels, nowadays, due to some new elements elicited by cross-islands relation and urban ecology of temple development, there are much more dynamic performances linking to the hierarchical relationship between ancestor temple and its branches.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201209-201211010038-201211010038-57-116,177,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

It aims to describe how Miao women demonstrate self-reflective thinking and construct self-identity through theatrical and female figures on paper stencils images. This paper outlines cultural and gender identification as it is present in the paper stencil images. These paper stencils, on the one hand, illustrate cultural history and social memory. On the other hand, from the perspective of political and economic boundaries, the images reveal the shifting and fluid boundary between Shidong Miao and Han Chinese.This paper will present four aspects of paper stencil images from Shidong. First, I will briefly recount the history of stencil techniques and decorative expression on paper stencils and embroidery in the Shidong Miao tradition. Second, I will examine and analyze a number of Shidong Miao myths and stories, such as the Butterfly Lovers, Snail Girl, the Tang Priest's Journey West and Wud Maox Xid, to provide an understanding of the Miao female images represented through paper stencils.

This paper discusses the differences in spatial constructions of ”Kaijokazari” 會所飾 and ”Byobumatzuri” 屏風祭 in Yoiyama, and the differences of their reactions against modernization. We also see in this case study, as Gion Festival had been selected as a Cultural Property, that maintenance of the form of the space, the pattern of performance and some objects used in Yoiyama, are considered essentials to the inheritance of the festival, for their role as agents to maintain the the identity of the core community, and as symbols of the continuation of tradition.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201206-201208030023-201208030023-67-113,176,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Spatial Transition of Peikang Matsu Temple during the Japanese Governed Period in Taiwan,"Yu-Hua Tsai, Min-Fu Hsu","religion policy, Buddhism, Matsu belief, cultural heritage, Confucianism","Although scholars have studied the historical transition of the Peikang Matsu Temple, a national historic building of Taiwan, the literature on its spatial change during the Japanese colonial period is still very limited. As a result, scholars are unable to pin down the exact time of the completion of each spatial structure of the temple. In addition, the academic discussion is not able to uncover what caused the spatial changes. This study tries to reconstruct the process of such changes of the Peikang Matsu Temple during the Japanese colonial period, explaining its spatial change in terms of the Japanese understanding of Matsu cult in Taiwan.This study finds that Matsu cult in Taiwan during the Japanese colonial period was characterized as Confucianism and animism, which was considered as something similar to Shinto worship in Japan. Due to this similarity, the religion assimilation policy before 1935 and other policies aiming at preserving Taiwanese historical sites in order to develop local consciousness and economy resulted in the expansion of the Peikang Matsu Temple from 1907 to 1929. Moreover, in 1919, a financial facility, a bank, was established in the newly expanded space of the temple.However, this study also finds that while the temple was expanding, the living space of monks was shrinking. This study argues that this transition originated from the changing religious environment caused by the regime change. Because the transplant of the Japanese Buddhism to Taiwan, and the exclusion of Matsu worship from Buddhism, there were fewer devotees becoming monks in Peikang Matsu Temple.Moreover, the introduction of secularism by modern education made the managers of the temple change their mind, setting up a clinic which provided free medical service to poor people in the temple in 1936, replacing the original religious healing with modern medical system, and participating in social welfare which was seen as one of the duties of religion organizations.Somehow, the radical Naturalization movement from 1938 to 1940, so affected the Peikang Matsu Temple that its activities were reduced. Only the cults of Matsu and Lord Wenchang (God of Literature) were preserved as they were considered as deities of Confucianism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201206-201208030023-201208030023-115-192,176,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Heritage as Space Identification: Heritage Discourse of Fengtian Community, Hualien",Yu-Chuan Chang,"space identification, heritage discourse, Fengtian Community, heritage, Hualien","Promotion of World Heritage by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has gradually extended the concept of universal value towards a new perspective on local heritage. As the concept of heritage was imported into Taiwan, it was generally translated to cultural property, which failed to project the overall meaning of the spatiality and practicality of heritage. In heritage discourse, the relationship between heritage and space is the medium best suited to connect locality and globality as well as historical memory and local identity. In this relationship, the interaction of nature and humanities is merged in a cultural landscape, which has been a popular topic in recent years with regards to heritage and space. This study attempts to view heritage as a type of space identification and presents the multiple possibilities of heritage discourse through case analysis of a cultural landscape. This study starts by analyzing the overall space of Fengtian Community in Hualien. Using the space identification of the Japanese immigrant village within the community, different angles of observation and identification for the cultural landscapes are investigated in the context of Taiwanese history.

"""Activating the Sediq Culture"": A Study of Cultural Industry in a Sediq Community","Mei-Hsia Wang, Iwan Pelin","image, weaving, the Sediq, cultural industry, ritual","Cultural industry demonstrates different forms of combining economy and culture. On the one hand, due to the speedy mobility of capital, information, and population, the local community is confronted with a very competitive challenge coming from international forces. On the other hand, the emphasis on ”cultural capital,” such as local knowledge and historical heritage, provides the local people a chance to subjectively interpret their cultures. As ”economy” is presented in the ”cultural form” during cultural industry development, culture is reconstructed, standardized, and objectified as ritual, festival, sport, garment, food, etc. In this process, culture is deconstructed, reconstructed, and represented in a new form. The local people redefine their cultures for fulfilling outer needs and making an inner transformation. This aspect is further associated with colonial government and national construction. Hence, cultural recognition is a dynamic process and a field of power display which includes the possibility of negotiation, competition, and re-creation.Regarding the research of ”culture industry” in Taiwan, many studies have discussed this issue from the aspects of policy promotion, economic development, community empowerment, and tourism. This article tries to discuss culture industry from an anthropological viewpoint, and explores how social or cultural features are operated, transferred, and re-created in the developmental process of cultural industry. This paper, firstly, describes how cultural industry is shaped by different power sources. Capitalism, power from Western churches, and different national departments affect the development of cultural industry. Interaction between the local and the global also plays an important role. Moreover, I will take several weaving workshops as examples to show the hosts' interaction experience with the outside world before establishing their workshops. Social networks based on the individual demonstrate how the Sediq social characteristics operate in a contemporary context.In addition, this article analyzes various interpretations regarding weaving patterns as part of the process of cultural reinvention. As entangled objects, weaving cloth embodies multiple images that combine with different meanings in different contexts. Furthermore, this paper discusses relationships between people and cloth, and highlights the locals' agency. The weavers' psychological journey gives us insight into the process of inter-construction between the subjectivity of human agents and the objectification of objects. In other words, a weaver constructs her identity through the sublation of an object's characteristics. The relationships between humans and objects are, therefore, dialectical. Moreover, learning and teaching weaving provides chances of constructing social networks and sociality. As community members construct social relations through sharing characteristics, a person's identity is an epitome of social relations and the process of reconstruction. More importantly, weaving is a field in which women can practice waya (literally, norms) and communicate with utux (literally, spirits). It could be viewed as a female ritual. Thus women participate in the regeneration of cosmic order through weaving.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201206-201208030023-201208030023-233-286,176,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Usually occupying a minor, secondary status in a temple, Marshal Tiandu is however notable for his exorcist power. Most professional traditional opera theater and amateur folk music troupes worship Marshal Tiandu as their patron god. In addition, the military troupes like Song Jiang militia or Lion dance troupe in southern rural Taiwan also worship Marshal Tiandu (alternatively called Marshal Tianfu, Lord Song Jiang) as their protective deity. The cult of Marshal Tiandu originated from Fujian (especially Zhangzhou and Quanzhou area). The unique background of Taiwan's immigration society fostered a prosperous martial arts practice. Many organized Song Jiang militia to guard their villages. The frequent floods and epidemic diseases further reinforced the Song Jiang militias' religious function of expelling evil spirits and eliminating epidemic diseases. Up until now, in the southern Taiwan temple fairs, the performances of Song Jiang militia and Lion dance troupe are not only entertaining activities, their patron god, Marshal Tiandu is also an important exorcist deity.

Using the Han Gao Ancient Notation by Ho Yuzhai as my primary data for analysis, I argue that chuandiao originated from various sources, including ditties from Ming and Qing dynasties, folk songs from eastern Guangdong province, and some Buddhist tunes, thus reflecting the southward migration history of central plains' music. These instrumental pieces of various length and format first circulated in the hanyue music system popular in the eastern Guangdong province and were later absorbed into hanju operatic music to function as intermezzo, referred to as chuandiao.

The meaning of qiancao has broadened with its raw material changing from Artemisia to rat whiskers and Gramineae. By analyzing tickling methods under ethological framework, we have found that ancient Chinese increased crickets' aggressiveness by tickling their jumping legs to induce leg spring, which conforms to the principle of displacement activity in ethology. The ticklers are used in the following four stages, regular training, pre-fight stirring, guiding and after fight stirring.

Improvisational Performance and Creative Involvement in Taiwanese Gezixi Opera,Ho-Yi Lin,"lyrics, lines, improvisational performance, character, play-writing, gezixi","Taiwanese gezixi Opera is the most representative of scenariobased performances. For a long time, actors of professional Taiwanese opera performed in a predominantly improvisational way. In examining the overall creative process of improvisational performance, it is easy to see that its essence lies in the creative involvement of actors in the play-writing process. Their performing skills are in fact akin to writing skills. For actors who improvise, completing a performance is like completing a round of creative play-writing. They are adept at telling spontaneous stories on stage in front of the audience. When they conclude a performance, a new play is essentially completed at the same time. This article examines the improvisational performance skills of actors in Taiwanese gezixi Opera. From the aspect of the ”creative involvement of play-writing,” I will first explore the skills of individual actors. Emphasis is placed on how they improvise spoken lines and lyrics sung on the stage. It is important for actors to be certain of the appropriateness and feasibility of such lines. They also need to know which particular tune to use for a given performance. The efficiency of the improvisational skills relies on the actors' total understanding of a given character's position, personality, and situation. Moreover, actors must know how to improvise lines and lyrics by way of interacting with each other. The skills commonly used in such improvisation are to cover, to save, to abandon, and to cut, while those for improvising lyrics are to rhyme, to get in tune, to add words, to similize, and to exaggerate. The article then shifts its focus to group collaboration in improvisational performance by addressing the issue of how an improvisational theater constructs powerful dramatic scenes through the characters in a play. As the actor is the absolute center of improvisational performance, the characters in a play are intimately bound up with a play's dramatic scenes. Actors have to bring their individual talent and acting skills into full play to construct convincing characters in performance. Ultimately, group cooperation is necessary for all dramatic characters and scenes to be woven together into a complete story.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201203-201204280002-201204280002-109-177,175,2012,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Such approaches, however, are rarely adopted by scholars dealing with Taiwan's musical past. This may be due to the fact that valuable historical collections are little known to scholars in Taiwan, or perhaps due to a more general preference for the written text as the main historical source. Drawing upon the attention paid to historical instruments and museum collections by musicologists and anthropologists, this paper focuses on 26 examples of Taiwanese aboriginal musical instruments that are either displayed or held by the Pitt Rivers Museum at the University of Oxford, exploring their historical backgrounds and further contextual information. The paper demonstrates how a museum's instrument collection can be used to contribute to historical research along with written sources.

The Tranquility Festivals and the Five Sectors Organization ofHuizhou since the Ming Dynasty,Zhen-Zhong Wang,"Big Meikou Village, Tranquility Festival, Huizhou, ""five sectors"" (wuyu), Shexian","The Tranquility Festival (Bao'an shanhui) is an exorcist festival prevalent in southern Anhui, also known as Wenzhou (pestilence boat) Tranquility Festival or Danian (great annual) Festival, Bao'an Festival, or in short, Well-being Festival (shanhui). The Tranquility Festival has existed, within the jurisdiction of Huizhou, in Shexian, Jixi and Xiuning. In this article, I employ various documents to reconstruct details of the Tranquility Festival in Big Meikou, Shexian. I will also describe different forms of wuyu (”five sectors”), their distribution in both urban and rural areas and their very flexible scopes. The ”five sectors” is a conventional geographical division and a network for temple fairs. It evolved into a fundamental local unit that handled public affairs beyond that of a single clan. In certain places, its functions were very similar to those of the literati association wenhui. However, the ”five sectors” organization differs from the wenhui, mostly in their levels of literacy. In general, wenhui was organized by degree-holding (or at least educated) intellectuals. The ”five sectors,” on the other hand, was composed of people who were sensible and capable of pursuing interests for their locality. Therefore, in poorly educated areas, the ”five sectors” networkalso functioned like wenhui and served as the most important council institution. According to the usual evolution stages of local network, in order to handle public community affairs, the ”five sectors” network most likely appeared first. Later, when literacy and education reached a certain level, the wenhui started to appear and gradually replaced ”five sectors” to become the most important council institution. Other than lineages and wenhui, the ”five sectors” represented an original form of local fundamental network. This is an issue which previous studies on Huizhou have never touched on.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201112-201203030050-201203030050-18-103,174,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Spirit-writing Halls and theDevelopment of Local Communities: A Case Study of Puli (Nantou County),Paul R. Katz,"Puli, phoenix halls, communal temples, spirit-writing,  disciples of the phoenix","In recent years, a growing number of scholars have begun to undertake path-breaking research projects on the development of communal religious traditions. However, such scholarship has tended to center on temple cults, largely ignoring the question of how modern Chinese social history was also shaped by voluntary religious associations that practiced spirit-writing. The goal of this paper is to highlight the social aspects of spirit-writing groups, particularly ”phoenix halls” located in the town of Puli (Nantou County, central Taiwan). In Puli, as well as many other parts of Taiwan, phoenix halls are home to highly diverse communities of men and women committed to the pursuit of self-cultivation, moral edification, and social activism. Their initiated members (literally ”disciples of the phoenix”) tend to sub-divide into many different groups, and people belonging to one group may not necessarily play an active role in another group's activities. In general, about a dozen or even fewer male initiates are in charge of a hall's spirit-writing rituals. However, dozens of other initiates devote themselves to performing rites for worshipping a hall's deities, while others manage the hall's finances and communal activities, including philanthropy, pilgrimages, and participation in local festivals. The historical and ethnographic data obtained during our research indicates that the rapid growth of Puli's phoenix halls has in large part resulted from the efforts of local elites, including those who manage these sacred sites and those who perform as wielders during their rites. In addition, it is clear that phoenix halls can only thrive by utilizing extensive networks of connections with other sacred sites, including both local temples and other phoenix halls. Phoenix halls continue to impact Puli's religious traditions today, both through their rituals and their engagement with local networks of power, while their educational and philanthropic activities have also made an impact on communal life. One might even be so bold as to say that some halls have developed according to patterns similar to those of major public temples.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201112-201203030050-201203030050-104-185,174,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Hybrid Modernity: A Study of Cultural Imagination and Practiceof the Overseas Chinese in Modern Kinmen,Chiang Bo-wei,"mimicry, cultural hybridism, social history, modern imagination, the overseas Chinese","Kinmen (Quemoy) is an island close to Quanzhou (Zaitun) and Xiamen (Amoy). Some residents emigrated to Southeast Asia before the mid-seventeenth century. Xiamen was designated a foreign trade port in 1842 and the Qing government legalized emigration abroad in 1860. As a result of these events, many young men from Kinmen emigrated overseas in search of a better living. With the eventual accumulation of their wealth, the transnational ”overseas Chinese” brought their capital back to Kinmen to participate in local affairs, such as renovating ancestral halls, establishing schools, as well as attending to the local politics, public security, and public hygiene. In this process, the ”overseas Chinese” merchant-gentry consciously followed the ”colonial modernity” model of British colonial Singapore and Amoy concession and developed a ”hybrid modernity” discourse and practice based on material culture. This paper will make use of Shining, an overseas Chinese newsletter, and materials collected from field work in Kinmen to explore how the overseas Chinese merchant-gentry reconstructed their social network in their lineage communities and developed a collective modern cultural imagination that manifested in education, political improvements, enterprise development, public hygiene and environmental landscape, etc. At the same time, they introduced an architectural style that combined traditional Chinese architectural elements and western colonial fashion, turning it into a cultural capital and power. On the one hand, the new architectural style established social prestige; on the other hand it represented an image of modern progress.

"Behind the Application for the Status of Intangible Cultural Heritage: A Study of the Female Deity Caozhu Niangniang (Lady of Lord Cao) in Yingde, Northern Guangdong",Wai-Lun Tam,"Yingde,  goddess,  Caozhu niangniang (Lady ofLord Cao), local deity, Intangible Cultural Heritage","Caozhu niangniang (Lady of Lord Cao) is an important local female deity in Yingde, northern Guangdong. An application for her cult as a national intangible cultural heritage was recently submitted by the Yingde County government, in which Caozhu niangniang was presented as a water deity of the North River that flows through Yingde. This application, apparently, takes other female water deities such as Tianhou (the Empress of Heaven) and Longmu (the Dragon Mother) as a model. Caozhu niangniang as a water deity, however, does not agree with the image which we got from our fieldwork. There are comparatively few temples in Yingde that worship Caozhu niangniang alone. She is more often worshipped with a dozen other local deities. Moreover, the miracle stories of Caozhu niangniang we collected have more to do with local defense against robbers than with transportation on the North River. Besides, the events in most stories happened in the mountains rather than along the river. Caozhu niangniang as a water deity appears to have been re-invented after the model of Tianhou, which now has become a national intangible cultural heritage. The number of miracle stories about local gods, especially about Caozhu niangniang's supporting local defense against bandits and the large number of accounts of bandits in Yingde recorded by various versions of the gazetteers lead us to believe that Yingde was integrated into the nation only in name, and not until the late imperial period. In reality, local military forces called bandits periodically occupied county government buildings, collected taxes and robbed villages. To defend against them, villagers organizes themselves under the banner of Caozhu niangniang. Caozhu niangniang alone, perhaps, was not quite strong enough in the matter of local defense. She was, therefore, worshipped in conjunction with a dozen other local deities, forming an alliance of supernatural defense. Among the alliance gods, it is intriguing to find Panggu, the main deity of the Yao, aminority tribe. The Yao are said to have been driven to the mountains by the Han Chinese long ago. In this paper, we try to interpret the worship of Caozhu niangniang in the context of the local history of Yingde.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201112-201203030050-201203030050-259-304,174,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Village Religion in Huizhou: A Preliminary Assessment,John Lagerwey,"geomancy, local gods, ancestor hall, Huizhou, village religion","If any late imperial Chinese local society can be thought of as representing the transformation of society in accord with the neo-Confucian principles, Huizhou would be it. It therefore represents a particularly interesting test case of how deeply these principles actually reached into the inner workings of that society: to what extent were other religious forms marginalized? The author relies on fieldwork to try to answer this question. While it would appear that Buddhist and Daoist specialists did frequently have a lower social status than in other parts of China, reliance on their rituals would seem to have been just as widespread as elsewhere, and the society as a whole continued to be structured around local temples, even if magnificent lineage halls came to play a dominant role in village architecture. Also, the place of the shuikou in structuring village space was just as important as in other parts of South China.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201112-201203030050-201203030050-305-357,174,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Irrigation and Territorial Construction: Sacrifice to the Deities of the Three Realms in Shezi Stream Basin,Bao-yu Fu," Deities of Three Realms, Sanqi Dam, Shezi Stream Basin, Taoyuan terrace, sacrificialactivities","The Taoyuan terrace was a very dry region before the building of the Taoyuan Great Dam, but the sacrificial activities related to irrigation were relatively rare. The only sacrificial ritual to the dam founders was in Shezi Stream Basin as in babenbu Opera, a kind of Peace Opera popular in Taoyuan. Its close relation with irrigation reveals local people's collective historical memory of the irrigation, and their interactive relationships derived from water control in early days. This essay shows that the interactive networks and the babenbu sacrificial activities arising from the Sanqi Dam construction and management extended beyond the south dam and villages south to the river, to include both south and north villages on both sides of the river. However those in the northwest and southwest not included in the babenbu sacrifice formed another sacrificial circle. It shows that the irrigation facility as a social space has its own nature and experiences. Meanwhile it is influenced by other social factors such as cultivation, ethnicity, and state power. Therefore, only when the irrigation space is viewed in an integral social-historical context, can we grasp the territoriality of an irrigation society and the hydraulic spatiality of a territorial society. This essay investigates, by the case of a traditional water dam in Taoyuan terrace, the multi-layered social relationships through the lens of irrigation in the context of village development. This essay attempts to point out that the social groups (ethnic groups) in Taoyuan constantly define the ethnic relations and territorial boundaries through the representation of dam construction and related rituals.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201112-201203030050-201203030050-358-415,174,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"The Ideas and Practices of the Xiantiandao's Lingnan Branch: The Case of the Feixia Dong (Qingyuan County, Guangdong)",Ichiko Shiga,"redemptive societies, Xiantiandao, Feixia dong Qingyuan County, Guangdong, Lingnan branch","This article intends to examine the ideas and practices of the Lingnan branch of the Xiantiandao (Great Way of Former Heaven) in modern Guangdong by focusing on the Feixia dong (Cave of Flying Clouds), its largest-scale vegetarian hall. One of the famous redemptive societies, the Xiantiandao was the successor to a popular religious sect called Wuwei jindandao (another name for the Qinglianjiao) founded in Jiangxi during the reign of the Yongzheng emperor (1722-1736); its origins can be traced to the Luojiao, which arose during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). The Lingnan branch spread rapidly all over Guangdong within just a few decades after a member of Xiantiandao from Hunan preached its ideas in Qingyuan County during the mid-nineteenth century, with construction of the Feixia dong beginning on a Daoist sacred mountain Yuxia in 1912. Its founder Mai Changtian was a wealthy merchant who ventured his entire fortune on this construction project. During its heyday from the 1920s to 1930s, hundreds of male and female members practiced a vegetarian diet and self-cultivation, withdrawing from the secular world. By examining various documents from the Feixia dong, the paper not only focuses attention on its members, activities and businesses, but also treats its ideas about life and death as seen in its scriptures and rituals. I also examine the ideas of a series of spirit-written oracles entitled Tianren milu, which was edited by He Tingzhang, a prominent leader of Lingnan branch. After 1949, the Feixia dong was persecuted by the Communist Party, becoming a target of the campaign to eradicate ”reactionary sects and secret societies” that arose in 1953.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201109-201110310003-201110310003-23-58,173,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Worshipping Confucius and Promoting the Dao: The Origin and Development of the Fuqing Tang and Shanqing Dong of the Xiantiandao's Hong Kong Ethics Society,"Chi-On Yau, Ting-Ming Ngai","Fuqing tang, Shanqing dong, Xiantiandao, spirit-writing, Confucian movements","Numerous Daoist halls (daotang) were founded in Hong Kong between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Chunyang xianyuan, Congshan tang, Wanfo tang, Cangxia jingshe, and Wong Tai Sin Temple, with most of these belonging to the Xiantiandao. The Fuqing tang of the Hong Kong Ethics Society, for instance, originated from the Zidong shanqing tang in Nanhai, and was established in Hong Kong in 1924 during the heyday of the Xiantiandao. An organization that worshipped both the Xiantiandao and Confucianism, the Hong Kong Ethics Society might not sound unique given the Confucian movements of the early Republican era. However, as the Guangdong Ethics Society and Macau Ethics Society became defunct, the Hong Kong Ethics Society became all the more important. Similarly, the Shanqing branch of the Xiantiandao also used to flourish, but as its Shanqing associations in Guangzhou, Foshan and Macau declined one after the other, the Fuqing tang and its branch, the Shanqing dong, still managed to operate in Hong Kong. This paper is divided into four parts. The first part explores how the Xiantiandao penetrated into and flourished in Guangdong. The second chooses Foshan as an example of the development of Xiantiandao in an urban context, and points out that ”spirit-writing” was one of the main features of Shanqing branch. The third discusses the unique conditions of Hong Kong that the Xiantiandao could exploit in its favor. The fourth uses the Fuqing tang of the Hong Kong Ethics Society as a case to explore the changes in the organization and administration of a Daoist association vis-à-vis the dynamics of modernity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201109-201110310003-201110310003-59-99,173,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Anchoring Guanyin: Appropriative Strategies in a New Phoenix Hall Scripture,Philip Clart,"syncretism, Guanyin, popular scriptures, superscription, spirit-writing","The fact that scriptures play such a significant role in the supposedly mainly oral culture of Chinese popular religion raises a number of questions: Who writes them? How are they used? What religious ideas do they manifest? How do they appropriate and affect the cult of their protagonist deities? The present article seeks to address these questions using the case of Guanyin's Lotus Sutra of the Marvellous Dao (Guanyin miaodao lianhua jing), a text revealed between 1998 and 2000 by means of spirit-writing at a Taichung city phoenix hall, the Xuyuan tang. The analysis of the scripture's structure and rhetoric reveals that the Guanyin sutra represents a mode of popular and sectarian engagement with the Buddhist tradition that differs from and enriches the picture provided for us by Chün-fang Yü's studies of Guanyin and by Prasenjit Duara's notion of ”superscription.” While we are definitely looking at a layering of meanings, as Duara did by regarding the Guandi myth as ”a palimpsest of layered meanings,” the image of ”superscription” does not accurately describe the way the Guanyin sutra does not so much overwrite but underlay Buddhist devotionalism with phoenix hall notions of Dao cultivation. In effect, the Guanyin sutra provides an inclusivist re-anchoring of Guanyin-related devotional practices in a core set of sectarian notions of personal cultivation, thus allowing us to differentiate a distinct mode of the syncretic construction of religious doctrine in a popular sectarian context.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201109-201110310003-201110310003-101-128,173,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The ritual music can be divided into two categories: one is the music used in the Expulsion of Calamity ritual, which has as its main functions calling back the soul of the dead and expelling the evil spirits of calamity; this music has direct ritual functions and accompanies the chanting of ritual texts by the yinyang. The other is the music provided by the yuegong of a ceremonial nature, with musical instruments including the shawm (suona), flute, small drum, and cymbals.

Although the Daoist altars of Tamsui and those of Southern Taiwan all originated from the Lingbao school, because of separate lineages and the dominant influences from Zhengyi and Shijiao altars of Northern Taiwan, the former preserve, or rather, gradually develop specific characteristics that set themselves apart from the Daoist altars of Southern Taiwan. This article, through fieldwork, in-depth interviews, content analysis, and comparative study, analyzes the characteristics of gongde rituals of Tamsui Lingbao altars. In the first half of this article, I attempt to outline the origin, transmission, and current situation of the Lingbao altars in Tamsui. In the second half, I compare their rituals with those of the Southern Lingbao altars, paying special attention to the content, procedure, and characteristics of the Hunxuan Altar liturgies. The Tamsui Lingbao gongde rituals are unique in the following aspects. First of all, the gongde rituals are rich in significance. Second, the content of certain ritual is particularly different from that of the Southern Lingbao altars. Third, the Tamsui gongde rituals lay much emphasis on filial piety and ancestral worship. Fourth, the Tamsui Lingbao gongde rituals have obviously been influenced by the Shijiao tradition.

I begin with a review of past scholarship on Republican era salvationist movements and their contemporary communities, comparing their treatment in three bodies of scholarly literature dealing with the history and scriptures of ”popular sects” in the late imperial era, the history of ”secret societies” of the Republican period, and the ethnography of ”popular religion” in the contemporary Chinese world. I then assess Prasenjit Duara's formulation of ”redemptive societies” as a label for a constellation of religious groups active in the republican period, and, after comparing the characteristics of the main groups in question (such as the Tongshanshe, Daoyuan, Yiguandao and others), argue that an analytical distinction needs to be made between ”salvationist movements” as a sociological category, which have appeared throughout Chinese history and until today, and redemptive societies as one historical instance of a wave of salvationist movements, which appeared in the Republican period and bear the imprint of the socio-cultural conditions and concerns of that period.

In response to the lack of effective government services, Daoyuan formed the World Red Swastika charitable society the following year. The World Red Swastika Society, which enjoyed the political support of many well-connected individuals, soon began organizing relief activities on a large scale, but would eventually come into conflict with the newly founded Nanjing government. At the same time, elements within the group were moving in creasingly close to Japan, forming an ideological alliance with a new Japanese religion called the Teaching of the Great Source (Ōmotokyō), and eventually becoming a breakaway organization under the Japanese client state of Manchukuo. Like Nanjing, the government of Manchukuo remained wary of offering institutional support, and began laying the foundation for its own charitable sector under direct state control.

Owing to the efforts of He Jing'an (f l.1920), Lei Yingting (f l.1920), and others, it spread over all of China within a few years, becoming an important religious movement of the Republican period.

The Religious Development of Confucianism in Early Republican China: A Case Study of Duan Zhengyuan and the Daode Xueshe,Chun-Wu Fan,"Daode xueshe, redemptive societies, Confucianism, Duan Zhengyuan, new religions","The turbulent political and social setting at the end of Qing dynasty and the beginning of the Republican era provided religion an opportunity for further development. Early Republican China can be viewed as another peak for religious development, in which the most prominent phenomenon is the extreme prosperity of redemptive societies. Whether in terms of the number of groups, the social power that each group had, or the effects they exerted on the society, the importance of these religious movements was unprecedented in Chinese religious history. However, this aspect has long been neglected by historians, with today's historiography too often overemphasizing new cultural history, history of mentalities, etc., with the study of popular religions remaining a minor stream within the vast flow of historical and social studies. This demands further exploration.Sakai Tadao has noted the intimate relation between the flourishing religious movements at the beginning of Republican China and the backlash of moralism, especially the promotion of the traditional moral codes. This study shows how Duan Zhengyuan (1864-1940), a moral reformist from Wenyuan County (Sichuan), founded the Renlun daodehui (Society of Ethics and Morality), whose creed was to promote moral codes and maintain humanism. In 1916, the Daode xueshe (Moral Studies Society) was founded in Beijing. The creeds of this society were to promote Confucian philosophy, practice humanism, promote world equality, and ensure world peace. These goals were widely accepted by the military, political, and social spheres. Moreover, the Wanguo daodedui (Universal Morality Society), founded in 1918, also worked on social didacticism, free educational institutions, etc., gaining the support of the people in northern China.

Both Mainlander and Taiwanese elites cooperated in promoting forms of popular Confucianism, including its religious aspects. Together, these elites founded a number of prominent Confucian associations, including the Zhonghua shengdaohui, the Zhongguo kongxuehui (Tongshanshe), the Danshui kongxuehui (founded by the Xingzhong tang in Tamsui, Taipei County [now New Taipei City]), the Juexiu gong (located in Taipei City), and related poetry societies. These associations' main activities included religious publications, lectures on Confucian doctrine, education, and philanthropy.The phenomenal growth of these associations and their activities resulted not only from the efforts of elites who espoused Confucianism, but also numerous political, social, and intellectual forces that helped shape Taiwan's early postwar era, particularly the loss of China in 1949 and ideas of national revitalization. These trends in turn prompted Confucian elites to become deeply concerned about the collapse of Chinese culture and moral degeneration, to which they responded by proposing remedies in the form of rejuvenating national culture. As one of the most prominent symbols of traditional Chinese culture, Confucianism not only possessed pure cultural significance, but also helped shape political discourse due to its profound connotations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201106-201107230005-201107230005-205-230,172,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Such construction represents critical functions such as the expression of sentiment, the definition of social class, and identity construction. In particular, for those who have profound diasporic experiences, they imagine and commemorate the homeland in daily life and festivals through their shared musical experiences. The musical sounds are characterized by ethnic and cultural traits, often delivering a sense of difference and tension between this group and the mainstream people in the new home. The sounds can also help define the ethnoscape and social hierarchy.

By exploring the content of lyrics and the creation process, this article aims to explicate how the ballads represent local history, tradition, and whose life of the Falangaw Amis. The first ballad is the ”Song of Labor,” which authorship and date are both uncertain. This piece describes the situations and feelings of the Falangaw Amis while they were forced into hard labors during the Japanese colonial period. Towards this period, the present-day Falangaw Amis generally retain a negative, sorrowful memory. However, the lyric of ”Song of Labor” implies more than just sorrow. The lyric of the second ballad ”Song of Mahengheng” was written by a local intellectual, Kuo Guangye. In his script he recorded the process of the composition and his ambition to construct the ethnic identity through eulogizing the much-respected chieftain Mahengheng. The content of the lyric also reveals the contemporary perspective of the Falangaw Amis recount their ethnic origin and the history of the villages. The third piece is the ”Song of New Falangaw.” In this ballad the Amis reflected their geographic environment and community construction after territory expansion, immigration of Han people, and the establishment of the satellite villages. The widely disputed claims of its authorship serve to reinforce the consistent feature of collective authorship in aboriginal songs. This research concludes with a discussion regarding songs.

I focus my analysis on the institutionalization of Hakka music in Taiwan from the 1960s until the early 1980s, examining the processes wherein Hakka music in Taiwan gradually became a distinct category along with the occurrence of musical and non-musical institutional activities, as well as the production and dissemination of related discourse and cultural performance. The social life of the Hakka remained relatively under-documented in official history of Taiwan until the 1980s, and during this time the voices and activities of various Hakka communities were primarily recorded in community-based media. Thus, I examine the early formation of Hakka music culture in Taiwan through analyzing the representation of Hakka music activities in Miauyo Monthly (1962-1964) and it s renamed version cal led the Chuangyuan Monthly (1964-1981). This magazine is understood to be one of the first publications in Taiwan with targeted reportage on Hakka culture and affairs. I focus on the processes by which cultural practices in the name of Hakka music increased with certain institutional initiatives and further became routinized as patterns. I also investigate the role of individuals and organizations as social actors in the processes. My discussion begins with the establishment of the Folksong Contest in Miauli County of Taiwan in 1962 and its significance. I further analyze how this event served as the catalyst for a series of institutional activities organized in the name of Hakka music, such as the grouping of Hakka music associations, the promotion of Hakka music ”reform” movements, the organization of increasing Hakka music contests and concerts, the tours of Hakka musical performances to Japan, the implementation of Hakka folksong educational programs, and the production of radio dramas, music records, movies, and TV programs featuring Hakka culture. Moreover, I explore the logics wherein these institutional activities could develop, studying the ways through which such logics facilitated the communication of Hakka music. Finally, I investigate the role of the Chuangyuan (Miauyo) Monthly in the institutionalization of Hakka music, discussing how it worked not only as a reporter and reviewer documenting Hakka musical events during this time, but also as an intervener that actively participated in and shaped the social history of Hakka music.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201103-201105030007-201105030007-121-179,171,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

In order to compile all the texts and images about music in Taiwan Daily News, the longest running newspaper with the highest circulation published during almost the entire colonial period, in summer 2008 the Graduate Institute of Musicology at the National Taiwan University undertook to construct the database ”Music Resources in Taiwan Daily News.”
This construction project has presently collected 26,370 clippings from Taiwan Daily News issued between 1898~1911 of the Meiji era. The news clippings indicate that Taiwan Daily News covers a wide range of musical activities of different ethnic groups in Taiwan, together with issues on musical exchanges within East Asia and on performance and dissemination of Western music in this region. In addition to musical materials, this newspaper encompasses those associated with a diversity of performing arts, social culture and new media such as gramophone records and cinema in the first half of the twentieth century. As more clippings from Taisho and Showa eras will be added to complete the ”Music Resources in Taiwan Daily News” in due course, an abundance of multi faceted historical materials will be available for the study of music and socio-cultural history.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201103-201105030007-201105030007-181-209,171,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
On a Special Historic Figure in World Cultural Heritage: Searching for Cheng Ho in Melaka,Shih-Chung Hsieh,"World Cultural Heritage Network, World Cultural Heritage Net-losing, Tourism of Sacred Site, Cheng Ho, Mt. San-pao and Pao-shan Temple","Melaka, the port city of Malaysia, was recognized as a world cultural heritage (WCH) on July 7, 2008. Cheng Ho, one of the greatest navigators in the world, had visited this place eight times in the 15th century. In the past three decades, several unhappy events occurred. First of all an old statue of Cheng Ho in the temple had been stolen in the 80s; the government had a plan to re-develope Mt. San-pao, the most important graveyard of Chinese immigrants almost at the same time, but people found no place to house a newly-manufactured huge stone statue in the 90s. The red statehouse located on the eastern bank of the Melaka River is a ”must see” classic Netherlands building for tourists, but more and more houses and stores on the western bank were painted red under commercial considerations. A ”Cheng Ho WCH network” had been established by a private Cheng Ho Cultural Museum in western bank whose aim was for business. On the other hand, a situation of ”Cheng Ho WCH net-losing” on the eastern side arose because of neglect among most of the Chinese residents. This particular enterprise in western bank fully takes advantage of WCH as a key base for exaggerating Cheng Ho’s position in relation to the business itself. Even though the network operated by the CHCM is separated from the orthodox network consisting by Mt. San-pao, Pao-shan Temple, old and new Cheng Ho statues, and a public Gallery of Admiral Cheng Ho opened in 2004, the former is getting more benefits through commercial success, and the latter has been becoming a net-losing due to unwelcoming attitude from Malay’s Islamic ideology and inattention of Chinese community. In the long run both the mountain and the temple have lost their opportunity to become sacred sites by means of tourism of WCH. Now they are likely to be marginal as tourist sites in Melaka.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201103-201105030007-201105030007-211-251,171,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Theatrical Resources in Taiwan Local Theatre,Fong-Hsiung Lin,"troupes, the Taiwan Local Theatre, Taiwan Provincial Local Theatre Association, anti-communism/anti-Soviet, theatre","During the period when the Taiwanese government championed with much vigor its anti-communist/anti-Soviet national policies, the Taiwan Provincial Local Theatre Association came into being in 1941. Its establishment was dominated by the KMT organizations. On the one hand, it carried out the government's determination to steer the direction of civil theater troupes' productions. On the other hand, it was a platform where combined the troupes and artists in strengths to gain their living, welfare, and development, very similar to a guild in its nature and function. Therefore, the Taiwan Local Theatre published by the Taiwan Provincial Local Theatre Association also possesses the two-folded features mentioned above. In the eyes of theatre history scholars, it provides rare and important documents. From the Taiwan Local Theatre, I have collated a) Sixty-six troupes with their managers' names. They include goa-a, luantan, jiujia, stage plays, musical theatres, and acrobatic troupes that actively sought performance opportunities between 1952-1953. b) Thirty-seven theatres with information of the managers, addresses, and telephone numbers . These were commercial theatres that provided stages for local performances. c) Two stage setting factories that produced artistic scenery background professionally. d) Two embroidery workshops that provided tailored costumes for theatres. The Theatre Column in the Taiwan Local Theatre introduced five performance art troupes, including Taipei Black Cat Musical Company, Mailiao Gongle Society, Gaoxiong Gaoyue Theatrical Company, the Butterfly Musical Company and the Duma Theatrical Company. These are first-hand information documented in between 1952-1953. Artists Column had introduced 32 performing artists. It is the basic material for studying the history of Taiwanese actors and actresses. There is also a column that announced performance schedules of famous troupes, which I compiled into a chart in the appendix. Even though the Taiwan Local Theatre had only published five issues, it reflected the Taiwanese governmem's attitude towards local theatre and witnessed the birth and eventual booming of commercial theatres in postwar Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201103-201105030007-201105030007-253-290,171,2011,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"The Occupational Transition and Theatrical Pattern of the Saishe Performance in Shangdang, Shanxi",Kui Wang,"stele inscription, saishe, opera guild, theatre","This article studies the extant theatre guilds of Shangdang, Shanxi. Based on texts inscribed on four steles, ranging from 1698 to 1884, I investigate the historical background of Yanhou Hall in Yuhuang Temple, Wuju Temple in Zezhou, Kaiyuan Temple in Wangchengtou Village, and Sansheng Temple in Lingchuan County. I also make use of the saishe texts circulated in this area that dated back to the Wanli reign (1573-1620) to inquire about the transitions from yuehu music households to theatrical artists, from government-sponsored troupes to professional troupes, from ritual performances to entertainment staging. In this process of transition, the Shangdang saishe opera became an obvious medium through which one perceives the Shangdang theatrical culture. The case examined in this article is the saishe performances in Jia Village in the city of Lucheng, Changzhi County. Analysis of the temple's characteristics and stage setting indicates that with the ever-shifting identity of the Shangdang music households, the artistic features of Shangdang theatre-both traditional and newly created-can be discerned in many of the saishe performances. Patterns of the Jia Village theatre offer a perspective for us to understand Chinese theatrical arts' process of integration since the Song and Yuan dynasties. Each of the various types of theatrical and performance styles with different historical backgrounds takes up a place in the saishe structure.

"The History, Performing Style, and Origin of ""Throwing a Tea Basket"" in Taiwan",Hsin-Hsin Tsai,"Goa-a Opera, chegu, Hakka Tea-Picking Drama, oral tradition, Old Drama","”Throwing a Tea Basket” is a performance in which the actor/actress throws a basket to the audience. The one who catches it into certain items before the basket is retrieved. The actor/actress then improvises as inspired the objects in the basket. The performance can occur either in a humble bamboo shack, commercial theatre or a temple fair. Its style is derived from the Hakka drama 'Serving Tea,” as well as oral and street performance traditions. In order to meet the demand of commercial theatre in Taiwan, it then integrates songs and dances, ”Throwing a Tea Basket” and improvisation singing in its performance. In its sequence of opening statement, subject-singing, and prize-awarding, the ”Throwing a Tea Basket” demonstrates features that are akin to those of the hesheng oral traditions of the Tang dynasty and the ”subject-singing” of Song dynasty. The prize-awarding to the performers and the throwing-and-catching skill illustrate the folk custom of dacai and the acrobatic tradition of the Chinese theatre. The ”Throwing a Tea Basket” is a ceration-in-performance that is accomplished by both the actor/actress and audience. It brims with joviality, creation, acrobatic skills, fun and a sense of mutuality. With the tea basket being thrown back and forth, it enables people on and off the stage to communicate and enjoy the merriment together. The ”Throwing a Tea Basket” episode Goa-a Opera, chegu troupes and Hakka cuoba show is a historical phenomenon that had existed since the Japanese Colonial period down to the 1960s and 1970s.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201012-201101270007-201101270007-81-141,170,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"From ""Waijiang"" to ""National Opera"": Study of Traditional Taiwanese Folk Style Peking Opera",Ya-Hsiang Hsü,"national opera, waijiang, Taiwan, Yiren Peking Opera Theatrical Troupe, Peking Opera","Since Peking Opera was introduced into Taiwan, it has been over a hundred years. Since early Japanese Colonial years, the Shanghai School of Peking Opera had frequently toured Taiwan. Under its influence, local opera troupes and amateur Peking Opera clubs were widely established. Local troupe began to add Peking opera to their repertoire. Taiwanese geishas learned to sing the new tunes. Music albums of Peking Opera were released. All the above-mentioned phenomena indicate that the performance art then called ”waijiang” had completed its localization process in Japanese colonized Taiwan and became a local operatic genre.
This commercially successful Taiwanese folk-style Peking Opera tradition occupied a prestigious status. Its vitality still prevailed during the early post-WWII years. However, since the Nationalist Government's flight to Taiwan, its policy towards traditional theater was to overlook Taiwanese folk opera and promoted solely the Peking Opera. The ”Peking Opera” in this case refers to the Peking School, not the Shanghai School of Peking Opera nor the Taiwanese folk-style Peking Opera influenced by the latter. With multiple unfavorable factors such as changes in political power, commercial competition and environment, the popularity of folk-style Peking Opera in Taiwan gradually dissolved. This collective cultural memory of ordinary people was replaced by the highly propagandized party/nationalist notion of ”national opera,” ”waisheng,” and ”military theatrical troupes.” The long-term stereotyping of the concept of Peking Opera and the general shift in the entertainment industry finally resulted in the dying out of Taiwanese folk-style Peking Opera.
In this study, I will start by investigating the change of local terminology for ”Traditional Taiwanese Folk-style Peking Opera” from waijiang to ”national opera.” I intend to deal with the following issues; the influence of the change over the development as well as ordinary people's cognition of Taiwanese Peking Opera, how the Taiwanese populace received, preferred, and eventually acclimatized to the artistry of Peking Opera, the interaction between Taiwanese folk-style Peking Opera with social classes, ethnic groups, and nationalism. Finally, the status of Peking Opera in contemporary Taiwan will also be discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201012-201101270007-201101270007-143-176,170,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
From Accompaniment to Vocal Imitation: The Adaptation and Application of Quju Music in Henan Zheng Music,Li-Chiung Chang,"zheng music, quju music, Henan zheng music, instrumentalization, theatre","There is a close relationship between Henan zheng music and Henan local theatrical music, quju. Many pieces of the Henan zheng music are based on the quju singing and its melody. This article aims to investigate the form and content of Henan zheng music to see how they are influenced by those of quju. The pattern of quju music, its melodies, techniques and stylistic features are discussed to demonstrate the close relationship between Henan zheng music and Henan local theatrical music.
Several existing Henan zheng works are discussed in this article. Analysis and comparison are carried out to reveal their fundamental musical forms, structures, melodic phrases, and playing techniques. Many Henan zheng musical works are mainly based on the adaptation of material from quju. During the early age, zheng was one of the accompaniment instruments of quju. It played the melodies from quju and imitated the singing.
The process of instrumentalization is all about the use of the variable musical features and the wide-range gamut of zheng, its richness in playing techniques, its drastic change in intensity and its coordination of speed and rhythm. It brings the stylistic features of Henan quju music to zheng music, namely the powerful strength, colorful contrast, rich ornamentation and the gradation of acoustic performance. It is not only an extension of Henan theatrical music, but also a key factor of Henan zheng musical style.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201012-201101270007-201101270007-177-231,170,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Following the tradition of Chinese ritual architecture, the ornate decorations in the ancestral halls of this region still retain rich pictorial materials. On the basis of these decoration images of the ancestral halls, this article attempt to explain the life and values of the common people in Chao-Shan region from the late Qing to the early Republican period, and note how scenes of the daily life of the commoners are reflected in the decorative images. Cases examined are several ancestral halls whose dates of construction range from the Qing dynasty to the early Republican period. Through analysis of the decoration placement in the architectural structure, themes and composition of the concrete images, this article explores the changes of the Chao-Shan people's values of this time. From these images in the ancestral halls, we can understand more directly common people's living condition.

The Mid-Autumn She Sacrifice and the She Tree Cult in Southern Taiwan,Yu-Chun Yang,"earth, zigu, earth god's walking stick, she tree, Mid-Autumn Festival, ritual theft","The focus of Mid-Autumn Festival has always been the moon. Yet one finds several folk deities, such as tree god, stone god, earth god, etc., also celebrate their ”birthdays” on Mid-Autumn Festival. These deities originated from primitive natural worship and in time came to be personified. The nature of such cults can still be considered as variations of the she sacrifice. The purpose of she sacrifice is to pray for the fecundity of women and crops. The she deity thus became a symbol of fertility. She sacrifice offered during festivities both endows and reinforces vitality. As a result, believers appeal to the she-representing tree gods on Mid-Autumn Festival to ”adopt” their children and be the children's divine guardians. Also on Mid-Autumn Festival, famers install ”earth god's walking stick” onto their fields to show gratitude towards the deity. It is a form of she sacrifice commonly seen in southern Taiwan. In Yunlin, Jiayi and Tainan regions, the ”earth god's walking stick” merged with such customs as zigu spirit medium and ritual stealing. The custom, though seemingly unusual, is still rooted in the cult of earth and big trees, of which the ultimate purpose is to pray for human and livestock fertility.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201009-201010280091-201010280091-1-44,169,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

A Study on the Lineage of Taiwanese Traditional Architectural Paintings from 1910s to 1930s,"Ya-Hui Tsai, Ming-Fu Hsu","craftsman, architectural decoration, Japanese Colonial period, traditional architectural painting, lineage","Han immigrants poured into Taiwan during the seventeenth century. With the political and economical development in mid-Qing dynasty, the number of immigrants increased. Temples and mansions were erected accordingly. Hiring master craftsman from China to construct or renovate buildings became a measure that guaranteed high-quality architecture. After WWII, some craftsmen moved to Taiwan with the Nationalist Government. Their craftsmanship influenced the style of traditional paintings on architecture, exhibiting a fashion different from that of pre-War times.
According to information gathered from written sources and field research, the development of Taiwan's traditional architectural painting can be divided into Ming-Qing period, Japanese Colonial period, and Post-War period. Each demonstrates its unique mode under different historical background. Judging from the amount of extant works, the period from 1910s to 1930s is the one when development of Taiwanese architectural painting reached its peak. In this article, I intend to explore the development of traditional architectural paintings in Taiwan during the Japanese Colonial period. Points to investigate include, 1) state-of-the-field review, 2) lineage mapping of the painting craftsmen, 1910-1930, and 3) analysis of the features of the craftsmen's painting.
The research on the traditional architectural painting in Taiwan covers a wide-range of subjects, such as lineage of schools, division of labor, contents of the paintings, construction process, material-specific techniques, preservation and repair. Based on interviews with the craftsmen, investigations on the architecture and corroborating materials, this article intends to build up a more complete and correct lineage map of traditional painting craftsmen.

However, with the modernization and urbanization in Chinese rural society, the internal structure and social recognition of the Nanfeng nuo ritual performance undergo voluntary and/or involuntary sifting, rearranging, re-formulation or riddance. While its social significance wears thinner, its recreational aspect is constantly being enhanced. On the other hand, such exception as found Shiyou Village also exists. Villagers here still follow the temporal and spatial boundaries as well as organizational patterns of the nuo ritual performance with persistence. Through annual demonstration, the rural traditional order is reaffirmed.
In this article, I investigate the features embodied in Shiyou nuo ritual performance; discuss its dissemination mechanism and point out that under a common nuo deity, the overlapped identification of subordination relationship and counterbalanced life order are reasons that allow Shiyou nuo ritual to preserve its archaism and originality while imposing strict regulations on its performances and dissemination.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201009-201010280091-201010280091-147-182,169,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Informed by extant scholarship, I observe and investigate myself the xuanjuan in Baimao and learn that the current development has its roots in folk belief that is closely connected with daily life. With a practical purpose in mind, people who participate in xuanjuan assume an attitude that when in action one does one’s best in his or her endeavors, at the same time they still seek the deities’ blessings. The xuanjuan performance preserves the simple style of traditional muyu xuanjuan, yet evolves gradually to become a popular art form serving the religious need of the villagers. The content of baojuan is classified according to the deities' nature, hierarchy and function into categories such as ”carnivorous or vegetarian,” ”large or small,” and ”decent or recreational.” In all cases, they are closely connected with local deities. The baojuan are rarely composed or compiled anew, but are hand-copied from older scriptures from one generation to another.

This village remains a distinct entity because of the policies of the British colonial government, which supported the preservation of New Territories villages that were already in existence in 1898. Government also gave support to their traditions, even in a rapidly urbanizing district such as Tsuen Wan. The resulting cohesion of Kwan Mun Hau fostered the preservation and transmission of the religious practices of the village, the lineages, and their constituent families.
These circumstances allowed for the comparisons that are made, broadly encompassing both continuity and change over time in the relationships between the religious practices of men and women, as well as some contrasts with the practices of indigenous Cantonese communities. Women's religious practices were and are addressed to various supernatural beings, but exclude the propitiation of ghosts, from which their ancestors offer protection. With the exception of very important occasions, when men lead worship, women worship the gods of localities: Tianhou, who protects their district; the village protective gods; the heavenly gods; and their household earth gods. They also participate in the worshipping of ancestors in the spring and autumn tomb rites, although men lead these rites, and married-in women worship lineage and family ancestors in the ancestral halls. Upon death, these women's souls are individually installed in the single ancestral tablet there, as are those of men, where they can receive offerings and enjoy peace and ancestral status in the company of others.

Within the Chinese population, Buddhists, Daoists, and Christians also express different social and spiritual outlooks in their food practices. Strict Buddhists make only vegetarian offerings, Daoists prepare sacrificial offerings of meat, and Chinese Christians, who describe their outlook as modern, do not offer foods of any sort to ancestors or deities. Nonetheless, broad commonalities in Chinese food culture perpetuate a sense of shared identity irrespective of religious affiliation. As food experts in this multi-religious, multi-ethnic setting, women play an important role in the simultaneous reproduction of religious distinction and ethno-cultural unity.

Forming Women's Genealogy: Daoist Monastic Women in Mongolian China,Shin-Yi Chao,"Daoist nuns, female activism, matrilineal succession, monasticism, abbess","Utilizing three tombstone inscriptions, this article studies the experiences of Daoist abbesses in China during the late twelfth and midthirteenth centuries. The abbesses, from both north and south China, built and managed multiple large-scale monasteries. They were also esteemed religious teachers and ritual specialists. They attracted resourceful patrons (including the monarchs), conducted ritual services, and trained disciples. After the abbesses' demise, their leadership positions were passed down to their chosen female disciples. The genealogy of masters and disciples is emphasized in all the three tomb inscriptions without exception. Upon death, an abbess transmitted to her chosen disciple not only a position or title but also control of the corporative resources owned by the monastery. The heir or successor took care of posthumous arrangements for the deceased, just as a son in an ordinary family would do. In this world of both economics and religious ritual, the matrilineal masterdisciple line constituted a fictive kinship that is comparable to the authentic partilineal kinship lineage in the secular world. This comparableness makes it socially accepted that monastic women were entitled to transmit the corporative inheritance to their female heir. Institutionalized matrilineal lineages thus came into existence in a predominantly patrilineal society. Female monasticism therefore was not characterized only by individual women who were exceptional in their careers, but by a system that supported matrilineal transmission and succession. In this aspect, monasticism stood not only separate from but far ahead of the rest of society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201006-201007130126-201007130126-156-190,168,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

This means that they deliberately craft a self-identity in contrast to tradition. They reject the age-old role of ritual specialists for the dead by reciting scriptures, performing death and memorial rites, and providing a place for the installation of the soul tablets and ashes of the dead in their temples. Instead, they devote themselves to spread the Dharma by publishing books and magazines, managing a high tech library and website, programming radio broadcast, and particularly by teaching Buddhism in the adult education classes for free which they established three decades ago, earlier than any other Buddhist groups.
I choose this community because unlike most Taiwanese Buddhist groups, Hsiang-kuang is single sex. It is also rather small, numbering about 100 members, 80% of whom have college eduation. This paper will use the interviews I conducted with Wu-yin, the abbess, and about 30 nuns of different generations in addition to documentary materials I gathered about the group. I lived in the head temple located in Chia-yi for eight months in 1998. The interviews were first conducted at that time. I visited the sub-temple in Taipei and interviewed Wu-yin in several subsequent return trips since. I hope to demonstrate what ”Humanistic Buddhism” means to members of the community by providing concrete examples of what they say and what they do.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201006-201007130126-201007130126-191-224,168,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
On the Protection of Mariners: A Trajectory in the Cultic Traditions of Southern Fujian from the Early Song to the Early Qing,Hugh R. Clark,"Mazu, Zhaohui gong, maritime, Xianhui hou, Su wangye","This paper explores the cults to four maritime deities that emerged in the Minnan area of southern Fujian. Three deities emerged in the Song dynasty: the Duke of Auspicious Response (Xianhui hou), the Lord of Illumined Response (Zhaohui gong), and the Maternal Ancestress (Mazu), also known and the Divine Woman of Meizhou (Meizhou shennü). The cult of the fourth, Prince Su (Su wangye), emerged several centuries later in the context of the Ming-Qing transition. The paper has two lines of inquiry: first, the range of protections offered by the deities; second, the relationships between the several cults. The first is the primary focus. The paper regards the protections offered to be a reflection of the needs of cult devotees. The three Song deities most certainly were not only turned to for protection of the seas, but reflect the broader interests of coastal villagers such as harvest and disease. But neither were they all alike. The Duke came from an inland village in Putian and only protected long-distance merchants. The Lord came from a village on the coast of Anhai Bay, and focused on protecting local fishermen. Mazu came from a small island that sat athwart the coastal sea lanes. Because this location offered the opportunity to join coastal traders, by the 12(superscript th) century Mazu had become the most important deity; the Duke and the Lord, in contrast, remained the patron deities of isolated villages. Later, Prince Su became emblematic of the Wangye phenomenon. He was the deity of a coastal village whose cult emerged because his devotees felt that Mazu had become too remote to meet their needs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201003-201005050022-201005050022-65-121,167,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

"The 1513 Conversion of the Pingyang Yao Temple: An Interpretation of the ""Sansheng Temple Stele""",Yong-Hua Liu,"Ming dynasty, ritual, The Great Ritual Controversy, Yao Temple, Daoist religion","Based on a case study of the 1513 conversion of ritual space at the Shanxi Pingyang Yao Temple, this essay aims to explore the relationship between Daoist religion and officially-recognized temples during the Yuan Dynasty and especially the changing attitudes of scholar-officials towards Daoist religion during the Ming. The Shanxi Pingyang Yao Temple had been included in Registers of Sacrifice in earlier dynasties. In the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, a Daoist priest Jiang Shanxin, together with his disciples seized the opportunity of temple renovation to assume control of this important temple. Since the Zhengtong reign (1436-1449), local officials had renovated the temple several times while keeping the Daoist elements (Daoist priests/Daoist deities) intact. It was not until 1513 that Censor Zhou Lun took charge to re-arrange its ritual space and eliminated the Daoist elements. This essay argues that the local officials' changing attitudes towards Daoist elements at the Yao Temple in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries reflect that the appeal to reestablish the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy had been gaining force. This change of social thought paved the way for a series of ritual reforms triggered by the ”Great Ritual Controversy” during the Jiajing reign (1522-1566).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-201003-201005050022-201005050022-151-188,167,2010,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Firstly, this paper will analyze Li Yu's ”mimesis” of Jingchaiji (The Thorn Hairpin) from the exterior plots and characters to the interior subjects and implied meanings. Through the close reading of the text, it is clear that Li Yu's invention came from the original classics of xiwen and zaju.

Time for Food and Clothing: The Construction of In-Group in the Shidong Miao Calendar,Zhao-Hua Ho,"Shidong, Miao, calendar, ait nangl, ait nongx, yin-yang","From the field work conducted in Shidong, Guizhou, one may perceive an ostensible Han-Chinese influence on the Miao people's calendrical practice of combining lunar calendar with the theory of yin and yang. However, a closer examination of their festival time, ritual practices and procedure fail to give a reasonable explanation regarding the many fundamental differences in time and course of actions between the two parties. Neither can one explain away the different content expressed in their concepts of in-group and out-group. In this article, I propose that the Miao people incorporated the imported notion of yin and yang and delicately combined them with their classification concepts of personhood, seasons and objects. Subsequently they created a new calendar based on the seasonal division of ait nongx ”looking for food” and ait nangl ”looking for clothing” that accentuates the Miao people's self-identification. I discuss in the article how the Miao people selectively adopt both Miao calendar and lunar calendar according to their bodily sensation of ”hot” and ”cold” as well as the socially constructed ideals of ait nongx and ait nangl. At appropriate points of time, they employ festivities and rituals to create a ”yin-yang harmony” that help them reach the goals of production and reproduction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200912-201002080060-201002080060-7-59,166,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Food is the most general and basic substance in daily life. However, other than being a critical resource in a politico-economic system, food could also serve as an important symbol for transmitting cultural messages and constructing col lective experiences. As an indigenous group inhabiting on the delineated historical savage border, the Saisiyat have manipulated food at different levels to express dynamic and multiple meanings. More importantly, food is used as a solid metaphor in ritual practices which generate bodily experiences through step-by-step processes. By analyzing food symbols and examining ritual actions, we could find that the transmitted food messages create critical media to define gender relations and construct inter-clan interactions among the Saisiyat. Furthermore, specific ritual foods, such as sticky rice and millet, are frequently manipulated to generate sensor y experiences and to objectify past images. In contrast to the rapid changes and constant conflict that characterize daily life, the Saisiyat dynamically re-construct social relations, transmit cultural values, and embody linkages with the past through reproducing and re-enacting food symbols in rituals.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200912-201002080060-201002080060-61-96,166,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The paper also focuses on the material aspects of the qin by examining its associations with the concept of tradition and time (the past, present, and future). As a constantly renewing process and one that is often limited to a particular pace or speed of change, the concept of ”tradition” has indeed played a very important role within contemporary qin practices and has provided a vision that projects toward the future.

Overlapping and Extending of the Time in Saysiyat Music,Yu-Hsiu Lu,"repeat, dwarfs' ceremony, aboriginal music, refrain, Saysiyat","Music is an art of timing; sound is a fluid process. Once it has been played, music cannot be recalled. Because of this fleeting nature, musicians must use repetition to make music flow continuously like time. Using memory music, the Saysiyat People have constructed a music form that seems to allows time to repeat itself. This helps them to remember the music. This method appears not only in their most important music, the paSta'ay dwarfs' ceremony song, but also appears in non-ceremonial songs.
In the paSta'ay dwarfs' ceremony song, lyrics appear in the form of 1212/2323/3434..., 1212/233/344..., or 12/23/34..., etc. (Every number represents a line.) This is one type of repetition used in Saysiyat music. Nonceremonial music has an additional two repetition methods. The last words of the previous line are placed at the beginning of the following line and the song is begun and ended in a repeating fashion. These three repeating methods make non-ceremonial music more complex and diverse than the paSta'ay songs.
The methods mentioned above allow relatively simple and straightforward lyrics to appear circular. Because of this circular way, the singer has more time to rouse up the next line. The circularity of the music also provides an opportunity for the repeating lines to create new memories in the audience.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200912-201002080060-201002080060-125-140,166,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The master carpenter marks on it the measurements of hun-phāng (post space), hun-tsúi (roof sloping), kiáh-lóh (beam space), chhún-chhioh (component dimension) and chhák-khóng (tenon and mortise). In these measurements taboos that derived from mechanical concepts are also implied.
In the past, most articles concerning traditional architectures in Taiwan lay their emphasis on the areas of construction taboos, feng shui prognostication and structural techniques. Recently, some scholars started to re-examine the construction concepts of master carpenters and devoted their researches to the device of Tng-ko. However, they invariably stress the basic definition of Tng-ko, leaving out the detailed Lóh-ko procedure as well as the interpretation of projected relevant space information.
Therefore, this research intends to address the design of chuandou timber frame and the construction concepts of the master carpenter Liao Chih-te's school by analyzing the master's actual Lóh-ko record. Analysis of the Tng-ko and evidences from actual examples yield the following results. First, from the Lóh-ko procedure one can comprehend the proportional scale and measurements of the master carpenter. Second, Liao Chih-te's construction cases are scanned in three-dimensions; the measurements thus obtained match that from the Lóh-ko procedure.

Form and Variation: An Investigation of the Woodwork Style in Ta-his,Ming-Chu Lai,"indigenization, conceptualized formation, variation, collective style, prototype","In the early 19 (superscript th) century the Lin Ben-yuan family built a stone mansion in Ta-hsi. With this they started a history of hiring craftsmen of wood frame and carving from Tangshan (China) to construction sites in Taiwan. Subsequently, when the other local gentry families began to build houses or ancestral halls in the mid- to late 19 (superscript th) century, they also employed Chinese joiners to make religious and daily-use woodworks. The Han-Chinese style woodworks thus continued to develop in this area. Therefore, the introduction and re-production of Han-Chinese style woodwork in the 19 (superscript th) century became a crucial beginning for the expansion of woodwork culture in the Ta-hsi area.
In the first half of the 20 (superscript th) century, under the Japanese colonial rule, the Ta-hsi woodwork industry underwent modernization, which brought about the Yan-se (Chinese style) and the Han-Ho (Chinese and Japanese) composite-style furniture.
After the 2nd World War, with its innate and acquired advantages, Ta-hsi came to be an important town of Taiwan's woodwork industry from the 1960s to the 1980s. For more than a hundred years both Chinese and local carpenters in different stages created woodworks with stylistic features that reflect changes in manufacturing techniques, consumer organizations, social background, aesthetics and designing concepts.

It is very unusual to have such kind of anthropological collections in Taiwan. In 1941, an investigation team from the Taihoku (Taipei) Imperial University brought back those materials. However it was not until the project of digitalization of all collections conducted by the Department in recent years, that one would know that Taiwanese anthropologists have the opportunity to ”study” Li material culture out of Hainan. Just four years right after Japanese scholars had transfered Li materials to Taiwan, they left. And then the civil war caused serious antagonism between Taiwan and China. Under the circumstances, academic contacts on the Li became impossible among NTU anthropologists and Chinese ethnologists. Furthermore, most of local ethnographers have devoted themselves to the sphere of Austronesian aboriginal cultures in Taiwan, and seem to have forgotten the Li materials which are put in a museum storage room on campus.
What Miyamoto Nobuto recorded while doing fieldwork in Hainan gave for the first time an academic meaning to these collections. The second renewed meaning came from a ”precious” imagination on the materials through their ”old age”. Attention was paid to the artworks/ utensils and photos for the third time by professors and their assistants at NTU when participating in the work of digitalization. On the other hand, at present Li studies in China are much more prosperous than in the Republican era. Quite a few works of good quality have been published. All academic contributions nevertheless have nothing to do with the Li materials and the digitalization in Taiwan. In other words, it will not change anything on Li studies in progress in China without taking into consideration NTU's relevant materials. People feel that the NTU Li collections are valuable because of the history of disconnection. For anthropological purpose, an accidental preciousness of a particular group of materials does not have any significant value. What I suggest is that scholars who are working on the NTU Li collections should initiate a new field research in Hainan, and study old materials in the daily life context of the Li community.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200912-201002080060-201002080060-315-360,166,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The Taiwanese operas, which had just gone through a hard time under the Japanese colonial rule and subsequent warfare, had a new higher authority-the Propaganda Committee of Taiwan Provincial Administrative Executive Office. When the relevant regulations issued by the Propaganda Committee came into effect, what impact did they bring to the Taiwanese operas? If ever political power were to affect the development of operas, in what aspect did it manifest itself and to what degree were the regulations enforced?
With the questions stated above, the present study attempts to clarify and discuss, 1) the organization and ideology of the Propaganda Committee of Taiwan Provincial Administrative Executive Office, its regulations about theater and the circumstances of execution, 2) the two restraining measures on theater development, i.e., script censorship and theatrical troupe registration, and how they were carried out or bypassed, 3) the crucial impact the Committee’s theater regulations exerted on the development of Taiwanese operas as well as the enduring influences.
By analyzing the ”Regulations of Movie and Theatrical Industry in Taiwan Province” and ”Rules of Management for Theatrical Troupes in Taiwan Province” promulgated during the period (1945.11~1947.3) by the Propaganda Committee, one finds that the Committee had formulated these regulations based on the censorship system in Mainland China and adapted them to meet the practical demands in Taiwan. Since the Committee laid much emphasis on the stage plays instead of operas, the regulations in question were devised accordingly. Therefore, the development of Taiwanese operas enjoyed a period of freedom that lasted for about half a year.
It was not until the promulgation of two new sets of regulations, the script censorship and theatrical troupe registration, did the operas come under the control of administrative system. The two systems in essence exerted profound and continued influences on the subsequent development of Taiwanese operas.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200909-x-165-5-45-a,165,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The fact that traditional theater in China still retains a considerable number of genres is probably a positive result of the ”Theater Reform” in the 1950s. It is also the one and only area where the Baihua qifang (Let a thousand flowers bloom) policy was carried out to the fullest extent.
However, ever since the beginning of the Communist Revolution, the principle to employ theater as a tool of propaganda has never been changed. Theater Reform became a stage for the politically-maneuvered cultural reform and led to a series of problems and complicated issues. Studies on the Theater Reform, up to now, have chosen to focus on its historical process, the repertoire and performance arts. The present article, with a perspective on genre studies, concentrates on exploring the conceptual background of Theater Reform, the positive effects reached by the preservation of traditional theatrical genres, the drastic measures it took, and the impact and problems thus created.
From the Theater Reform of the 1950s to the 10-year Cultural Revolution, the traditional theatre had undergone a series of changes. During this long process, the reform never stopped. In retrospect, the period that laid the foundation for Theater Reform hinged on the 1950s. In recent time when all strive to revive the theatrical arts, it is crucial that we approach the core of the issue to understand in the historical context of Theater Reform.

From Red Plum Pavilion to Li Hui-niang: A Case Study on Traditional Theatrical Performance and Political Transition,Yuan-How Lee,"ghost plays, Li Hui-niang, Theater Reform, Lady Plum Blossom/Red Plum Pavilion","This paper investigates the transformation of the story Lady Plum Blossom: Li Hui-niang from Ming dynasty onward. My discussion begins with its modifications in theatrical performance, followed by the reformation and remodeling which political power executed on the traditional opera. I also examine the ways political ideology exerted its influence on it. Subsequently, I propose that political ideology is by no means unchallengeable. It can be seen from various perspectives.
Back in the time when ideology prevailed, the competing viewpoints reflected clashes between different political interests. Unsurprisingly, literary works that advocated ideologies came to represent vying political factions. Such was the particular fate of traditional Chinese drama of this period.
The story of Li Hui-niang, a secondary plot from the Ming drama Lady Plum Blossom, was adapted into a Qing bangzi play Red Plum Pavilion, and became one of the most frequently performed plays of the acrobatic female character pudie dan. In the early 1950s, the play was considered a ＜||＞ghost play＜||＞ and banned by the Theater Reform Movement. In 1956, the restoration of Qinqiang play Visiting the West Lake put the Li Huiniang story under the spotlight again. Due to its laudable ＜||＞antifeudal” elements, it was later adapted into Peking and Kun operas. As a result of the continuous influence of the Four Famous Dan, Peking opera boasts a total of four adaptations, as opposed to one Kun opera adaptation of Li Hui-niang. As the clashes between ideologies continued, the play formerly praised for its anti-feudal spirit was condemned as a ghost play that represented feudalism and superstition. Hence, it joined the other new historical plays Xie Yaohuan and Hai Rui Ba Guan, to become the three poisonous weeds, labeled by the official periodical Chinese Theatre, which condemned anti-party and anti-socialism thought. Not until 1978 were these plays revived on stage again. Within one single generation, the story of Lady Plum Blossom: Li Hui-niang had been interpreted as a ghost play, containing anti-feudalism, anti-communist party or antisocialism. It captured vividly the paradoxical tension between political power and theatrical performance in the grim years of Cold War.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200906-200907130045-200907130045-5-43,164,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

I use the term Lahun Tune to refer to the period characteristics of this art form, including its artistic features and state of existence before it entered the official system in 1953. The term, Liuqin Theater, designated at dawn of the new China, is used to refer to the various states of the same art form. Progressive transformation from Lahun Tune to Liuqin Theater gave rise to fundamental changes in terms of music, repertoire, as well as social attributes like performing subjects, organizations, and ways of transmission. Such are the subject matter and primary concerns of this article.
The evolvement from a folk singing style to a regional theatrical genre is a common process many theaters in China had gone through. With Liuqin Theater as an example and the Theater Reform Movement of 1950s its background, this article endeavors to demonstrate the transmission and transitions of art forms themselves and their social roles in historical transformation, so as to reveal the coordinate relations between social forces and art forms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200906-200907130045-200907130045-45-95,164,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Manipulation of Propaganda Drama as Seen in Yangge and Anti-Communism Plays,Tse-kwan Kuo,"anti-communism/anti-Soviet Russia, reform of traditional opera, competition of local theatre, political propaganda, yangge","Early last century, with the political changes, there was a call for reform of the traditional drama. The strong influence of traditional drama on the mass is often considered by men of vision to be instrumental in the process of political or social reform of entire social modernization. It is also a continuation of the traditional moral education.
The yangge opera in mainland China and the fangong kang'e (anticommunism and anti-Soviet Russia) opera in Taiwan that came out around the late 1940s to 1950s are classic cases of traditional drama being utilized in political propaganda. Though they shared similar purposes, the difference in manipulation had resulted in different influences on later theatrical developments.
This article analyzes the two kinds of operas that came into existence in the context of the confrontation between Kuomintang and communist party. I describe the context and analyze those operatic works with propaganda purpose in terms of their strategies of subject placement, ways of form-adoption and development of conventions. I will also illustrate the contrasting influences they brought about.
Political propaganda drama is the product of a special context. It manifests most visibly the effects of political influence and causes multi-dimensional consequences. The formation and influemces of the yangge opera and anti-communism drama reflected the process of social modernization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200906-200907130045-200907130045-97-161,164,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Televised Puppet Theater and Politics: An Alternative Anti-Communism Drama in the 1980s,Long-Ting Chen,"puppet theater, martial law, structural linguistics, metaphor, metonymy","The anti-communism plays were popular from the 1950s to the 1970s. By the 1980s, Taiwanese government lifted the martial law and gradually moved towards a more democratic regime. The anti-communism plays that were popular during early post-war years had declined by now. However, the televised puppet theater of this time demonstrated strong anti-communism features. This article examines the puppet show ＜||＞Sacred Sword Evil Blade and the Liuhe Soul＜||＞ produced by Taiwan Television Company in December 1982. By exploring this alternative traditional-communist play, I intend to re-consider the semantics and diverse creativity of the ancient-costume puppet theater of the martial law period. I will employ the linguistic theory of Roman Jacobson to explore the semantic significance of the characters Chhiah-ng, Jiông-tãt-o, and E-á Tëng, and proceed to reveal the meanings delivered after a metaphor/ metonymy process.
On the other hand, I will continue my long-term research on the anticommunist plays of the 1950s and examine the diverse creative resources of the traditional-costume puppet theater of the martial law period as well as its interpretations. I seek to re-define the development and influences of the anti-communist plays.

"Kings and Village Deities: An Investigation of Buddhist Deities and Village Temples in the Dali Region, Yunnan",Jui-Chih Lien,"Buddhist legends, genealogy of deities, Hariti, village temples and deities, the Divine King of Five Hundred","The main focus of this paper is on the role of local legends in the worship of historical figures. Kings, queens and heroes of the old kingdoms, as well as Buddhist deities such as Guanyin and Mahakala, are widely worshipped as village deities in the Dali region of Yunnan. The classification system for these deities accords to the religious positions and titles for the territorial divisions of Buddhist kingdoms as used in Tantric ritual and teachings. Thus, the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms (752-1254) used Buddhist ritual orthodoxy to elevate territorial gods and chieftains into a unified system of worship.
Special attention is given to Xizhou, a part of the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms inhabited by the descendants of the Duan-surnamed kings. On the one hand, local legends cite the mother of the first Duan-surnamed king as being worshipped as Hariti, an Indian goddess. On the other hand, local villagers still worship the first Duan-surnamed king as the Divine King of Five Hundred (Wubai shenwang 五百神王). The above two instances, together with other examples, establish that the genealogy for deified historical figures serves as an idiom for a social system organized in terms of Indian legends. Moreover, although the deification of historical figures was in terms of the Buddhist Canon, they also served locally in the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms as princes, chiefs, and mountain gods, or even the gods Mahakala and Mahavairocana. It is in this latter local sense that they have been preserved in village temples from the Ming dynasty onward. Thus, village deities as a symbolic system reveals historyas-practice in an earlier elevation of historical figures specific to the Nanzhao and Dali kingdoms to the status of Buddhist legendary figures, and a later devolution of these same historical figures into the gods of local temples.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200903-x-163-17-70-a,163,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Our microanalysis of Buddhist elements of the civil altar portion of the jiao ritual in Yingde challenges the conventional view that all jiao rituals are Taoist rites; instead, we propose to use the concept ”liturgical Buddhism” to describe these rites. Our argument is built upon the self-identity of the ritual specialists, a microanalysis of the ritual itself, and an examination of the symbols of the costume and altar of ritual specialists in Yingde. We have also compared the ritual specialists in Yingde with those in Hong Kong, due to the fact that both refer to themselves as ”Namos.” While the Yingde Namos identify themselves as Buddhists, and the Hong Kong Namos identify themselves as Taoists, our comparison has shown that these local ritual specialists share many common features. The Namos in Yingde consider themselves to be Buddhist monks, but they do not leave the household, and are thus best described as belonging to ”popular Buddhism” or ”diffused Buddhism.”",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200903-x-163-71-115-a,163,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Dragon Flower Teachings and the Practice of Ritual,Barend Ter Haar,"iconoclasm, Dragon Flower Gathering, lay Buddhism, Ritual, Luo Qing","The Dragon Flower Gathering (Longhuahui龍華會) is a lay Buddhist religious movement that was founded during the late sixteenth century and has continued to exist until today, both on the Chinese mainland and in Taiwan. This movement is particularly noteworthy for the sizeable amount of texts that it has produced over the centuries, which allow us to investigate many of its members' viewpoints in considerable detail. One key characteristic of these works is a strong interest in proper worship and ritual, a perspective that is highly indebted to the lay Buddhist author of the early sixteenth century, Luo Qing羅清(1442-1527), who in his Five Parts in Six Volumes (Wubu liuce五部六冊) explicitly disparaged most lay Buddhist rituals as useless and meaningless activities. Of all late Ming religious movements, the Dragon Flower Gathering is the only one to fully address Luo Qing's criticisms, causing it to become widely known for its astonishing rejection of ancestor worship and the burning of paper money. In addition it took the vegetarian lifestyle very seriously. These views situated the movement largely outside of local ritual frameworks, making it difficult for members to participate in communal life. The Dragon Flower Gathering's first two patriarchs, Yin (or Ying) Ji'nan殷／應繼南 (1527/1540-1582) and Yao Wenyu姚文宇 (1578-1646), gained renown for their strict lifestyles, with Yao's ritual practice being documented in particular detail. Such accounts typically portray him as impressing demonic and divine forces by the power of his charisma, and not by magical rituals. They also stress his practice of sober Dragon Flower Gathering rites, which are mainly directed at expressing the believer's devotion. This skeptical attitude towards ritual was shared by subsequent generations of followers, who sometimes got into trouble because of their beliefs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200903-x-163-117-159-a,163,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Community and the New Buddhism in Taiwan,David C. Schak,"community generation, socially-engaged Buddhism, modern Taiwan society, social capital, migration","Chinese folk religion played an important role in strengthening ties between families in village temple communities, but in so doing it created boundaries between one temple community and another. Moreover, with the mass migration to urban areas over the past fifty years, the great majority of the population no longer lives in local rural communities. This paper, based on survey and interview data in addition to secondary sources, will argue that Taiwan's new Buddhist groups (Tzu Chi慈濟, Foguangshan佛光山, Fagushan法鼓山, Lingjiushan靈鷲山, Fuzhi福智, and Zhongtai Chansi中台禪寺) not only have a positive effect on community formation by providing venues where like-minded people can get to know each other, the communities created are inclusive, vitiating ethnic/political divisions in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200903-x-163-161-192-a,163,2009,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Religious Philanthropy and Disaster Relief in Taiwan: Lessons from the Post-921 Earthquake Reconstruction,André Laliberté,"religious charity, disaster relief, welfare regime, Tzu Chi, Buddhist philanthropy","Policy-makers, media, and outsiders often look at the achievements of the Buddhist Compassion Merit Society for Relief (Fojiao Ciji Gongdehui佛教慈濟功德會, hereafter Ciji) in the management of its hospitals and its contribution to education in Taiwan as an example of the benefits to society made possible by the involvement of religious institutions in the delivery of social services. Some of the policy-makers who believe that the state is spending too much for the provision of health care and social welfare services see in the activities of organizations such as Ciji proof that civil society organizations can do better than the state for the provision of key social services such as health care and disaster relief. This paper argues that despite the remarkable achievements of Ciji in health care, education and disaster relief, these claims that religious institutions can represent an effective alternative to the state may be too optimistic. It discusses this issue by first presenting the major organizations involved in the reconstruction effort following the 921 earthquake. Then, it will present the arguments of the experts who emphasize reliance on civil society and religious organizations for social services. In a third section, it will underline the opposition this model receives from politicians with different views on religion, civil servants involved with social policy and religious affairs, media, academics, and some of the religious actors themselves details about Ciji and other Buddhist organizations' efforts to provide emergency disaster relief and sustain the reconstruction of residential housing and schools.

"A Preliminary Investigation of Gender Culture as Seen in the ""Receiving the Rosary"" Rituals as Performed in Chen Village, Shibi Town, Ninghua County",Ping-Ying Huang,"Receiving the Rosary, Buddhism, gender culture, women's studies, Hakka","The rite of ”Receiving the Rosary” (jiezhu) is highly popular in rural areas of Ninghua County, Western Fujian. This includes places such as Shibi Town, one of the founding sites of the Hakka people. The ”Receiving the Rosary” ritual, which has not been extensively studied, is performed when people reach a certain age (generally about 50 years old), whereupon they invite Taoist specialists to select an auspicious day to perform rites for the bestowal of Buddhist prayer/meditation beads, as well as commencing the recitation of the Amitabha Buddha's name and the chanting of Buddhist scriptures. The performance of these rites also involves the preparation of new clothes and observance of a variety of taboos, all of which is designed to strengthen the worshipper's commitment to performing Buddhist rituals. At the same time, it seems rather curious that Taoists play such a prominent role in these ostensibly Buddhist rites. This suggests variation from traditional Buddhist culture, a point that is worth greater attention.
This paper is a case study of Chen Village in Shibi, the main reason being that nearly all the men and women in this village take part in ”Receiving the Rosary” rites. Such practices provide an important opportunity to better understand Chinese gender culture. Apart from the Introduction and Conclusion, the paper is divided into three parts. Section II is devoted to the wide range of meanings attributed to the ”Receiving the Rosary” ritual, as well as the diverse roles played by local villagers and religious specialists. Section III examines the ritual process for both ”Receiving the Rosary” and Buddhist recitation practices. The symbolic meanings of these rites are the subject of Section IV, while the Conclusion analyzes the importance of such rituals in the construction of local gender culture, as well as the implications of this data for the field of women’s studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200812-x-162-23-83-a,162,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"The Southern Min Mortuary Ritual ""Midnight"": A Case Study of the Ciming Altar in Fengshan Village, Shoufeng Township, Hualien County",Shih-Hsien Yang,"Shijiao, Hualien County, mortuary ritual, liturgies, Ciming Altar","The long-standing tradition of mortuary rituals (literally ”rites of merit” or gongde) constitutes one important phase of Taiwanese funeral ceremonies. According to historical records, Taiwanese people have relied on Buddhist or Daoist specialists to preside over such rites. However, recent field investigations reveal the presence of an additional type of specialist that also performs mortuary rites for the general public, namely masters who claim to belong to a religion known as Shijiao (literally ”The Teachings of Sakyamuni”). The Shijiao is a loosely organized religious movement that embraces elements of Buddhism, Daoism, and communal religious traditions. Although the Shijiao has been the subject of several articles, most have focused on its presence in western Taiwan. In contrast, the development of the Shijiao in eastern Taiwan and the general state of its mortuary rituals has received little attention from the scholarly world. To bridge this gap, I have chosen to examine the Ciming Altar of Fengshan Village in Shoufeng Township (Hualien County), and present a detailed account of the various liturgies that constitute the ”midnight” (wuye) mortuary rite. I first define the term ”Shijiao” and delineate this movement's origins, distribution, and sectarian affiliations, in order to clarify aspects concerning the titles, functions, and religious attributes of its specialists. Next, I describe the current state of the Shijiao in Hualien and the development of the Ciming Altar. Additional attention is also devoted to the scale, timing, altar arrangement, participants, musicalinstruments, and costumes of the ”midnight” ritual.

"The Cult of Jigong and Spirit-writing Associations in the Late Qing and Early Republican Eras, with Some Remarks on the Origins of the Chinese Society for the Relief of Sentient Beings (Zhongguo jishe",Chien-Chuan Wang,"spiritwriting, Chinese Society for the Relief of Sentient Beings Zhongguo jishenghui, Pavilion of Gathered Clouds Jiyun xuan, Southern Screen Branch Nanpingpai, cult of Jigong","The cult of Jigong began to develop in the late Ming dynasty and flourished all over China by the late Qing and early Republican periods. Heretofore most scholars have assumed that the spread of this cult was influenced by novels and plays on the Jigong theme, but apart from these factors the strongest forces propagating this deity were spirit-writing associations.
This paper employs the Precious Litany of the Buddha-Patriarch of Southern Screen [Hill] for the Rescue of Sentient Beings and for Saving Transformation (Nanping Fozu jiusheng duhua baochan) as well as the Gazetteer of the Hidden Palace of the Buddha-Patriarch of Running-Tiger [Hill] (Hupao Fozu zangdian zhi) to describe the emergence and flourishing of spirit-writing cults in the late Qing and early Republican periods. This process was furthered by the efforts of two Jigong spiritwriting groups to spread their teachings and organize pilgrimages to the West Lake in Hangzhou, where the historical Jigong had passed his life: the Shrine of Perpetual Relief (Hengji tan) in Fuyang and the Shrine of Eternal Relief (Yongji tan) in Wushan (Hangzhou), both in Zhejiang province. In 1915, they established the Pavilion of Gathered Clouds (Jiyun xuan) in Shanghai as a basis for their operations there. A year later they founded the Chinese Society for the Relief of Sentient Beings (Zhongguo jishenghui) to further promote their charitable relief activities. The success and widespread recognition of the Society helped solidify the organizational structure of the Pavilion of Gathered Clouds and allowed it to widen its activities to include pilgrimages every spring and autumn to Jigong's stupa at West Lake and even to claim its own denominational identity as the ”Southern Screen Branch” (Nanpingpai). The group proselytized actively and attracted well-known personages such as Wang Yiting into its ranks. Even though they cooperated with Buddhist organizations, the group remained lay-based and kept its distance from the sangha. So, although the group was regarded as lay Buddhist, it was not subordinate to the sangha, as other lay associations frequently were.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200812-x-162-139-169-a,162,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
New Bodhisattvas for a New Era: Lay Buddhists and Spirit-writing Groups in Shanghai during the 1930s-1940s,Chun-Wu Fan,"Mu Daoren, Yinguang, Lai Su She, Jiang Yiyuan","Of the various religious activities that flourished in China at the beginning of the 20(superscript th) century, the popularity of spirit-writing (fuji or fuluan) movements whose origins can be traced to the 1840s appears to have reached its peak, in part due to the assistance of associated groups. Due to the fact that Shanghai was situated at the center of many important transportation routes, many members of religious groups gathered there to set up branch organizations, which included the founding of phoenix halls (luantang) where spirit-writing rites were performed. Historical records indicate that the number of these branches in Shanghai reached more than one hundred, including the Chinese Society for the Relief of Sentient Beings (Zhongguo jishenghui), the Pavilion of Gathered Clouds (Jiyun xuan), and the Morality Association (Daode hui). Scholars who have investigated the history, social activities, and organization of these phoenix halls have provided excellent research results, while shedding light on the importance of deities like Jigong and Lü Dongbin. However, one issue that merits further exploration is the links between spiritwriting movements and Buddhism. On the one hand, sprit-writing was criticized by both the old and new branches of Chinese Buddhism at the beginning of the 20(superscript th) century. However, the links between these two religious traditions may be seen in the history of one particular spiritwriting group: the Lai Su She (literally ”Society of Coming to Jiangsu [Province]”), which was set up in Shanghai on August 6, 1929. The Lai SuShe worshipped as one of its leading deities someone referred to as Mu Daoren, who was said to have been an eminent monk during the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), and whose prognostications, medical treatments, and poetry (all provided during spirit-writing rituals) were held in high prestige. As a result, many elite scholars and monks, such as Jiang Yiyuan (1876-1942), Ding Fubao (1874-1952), Gao Chuiwan (1877-1958), Tang Wenzhi (1865-1954), and Hu Pu'an (1878-1947) all participated in the Lai Su She's spirit-writing activities, while Mu Daoren spoke highly of eminent monks like Yinguang (1861-1940) and Hongyi (1880-1942). The fruits of these activities were then published as Mu Duo Sheng, and circulated for public consumption. In addition to the history of the Lai Su She and the deeds of Mu Daoren, the contents of Mu Duo Sheng reveal how these scholars and monks gradually believed in the existence of Mu Daoren as they turned away from the influence of modern science. The Lai Su She deserves our attention because it included Buddhist members, who at the beginning of the 20(superscript th) century tended to revere Buddhism to the exclusion of other religious beliefs. One key question to be explored in this paper is why these Buddhists participated so fervently in the spirit-writing activities of Lai Su She.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200812-x-162-171-215-a,162,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Body Autonomy, Rational Subject, and Theatrical Imagination: Nietzsche and Aristotle",Cheng-Tse Wu,"Nietzsche, German Romanticism, shamanic epistemology, body autonomy, Aristotle, Greek tragedy","In this essay, I argue that Aristotle's and Nietzsche's tragic theories presuppose two modes of epistemological system, which are the oracular, shamanic system and the Socratic system. In addition, I will point out that these two epistemological systems are based on two different types of state of consciousness. The former, shamanic one is the result of a bodily autonomy experiences, while the latter, is the rational subject’s state of consciousness. For Aristotle, the justice of city state has to be understood in terms of the Socratic rationality. Thus the nature of tragedy is established as a structure (for instance, discovery and reversal). For Nietzsche, however, the art form of tragedy is a medium for transmitting energy, or a demonstration of bodily force. I shall specify the historical circumstances of the formation of the two tragedy theories.

"Body, History, Gender, and Power: Dance Theatre and Taiwan Society, 1980s-1990s",Ya-Ping Chen,"body discourse, subjectivity, gender, Taiwanese contemporary dance, dance theatre","The body is the primary medium of dance. In conventional dance discourses, it is often regarded as an essential, pre-discursive and universal existence, a neutral instrument for exploring and expressing the innermost mystery of the human soul. However, German choreographer Pina Bausch’s dance theatre, by means of its unique theatre aesthetics and performance strategy, narrates a discourse about the ”unnatural” nature of the body and the construction of human subjectivity through social, cultural and inter-personal relationships. In the 1980s, the concept and style of Bausch’s dance theatre were brought into Taiwan and engaged in a rich dialogue with the drastically transforming Taiwan society. It not only provided Taiwanese dance creators with an effective means to interact with current socio-political issues, but also presented the body as a site of power struggle and possible subversion. This essay begins with a narration of the discourses in Western contemporary dance on the body and compares them to Bausch’s dance theatre, which resonates with the poststructuralist delineations of the human subject and their corresponding body discourses. Against this aesthetic and philosophical background, the essay then discusses how dance theatre inspired the Taiwanese dance scene in the 1980s and 1990s, with examples of choreographies by Lin Hwai-min, Tao Fu-lann and Hsiao Wo-ting. It explores the many manifestations of dance theatre’s integration and interaction with local history, socio-political issues, and the awareness of unbalanced power structure in Taiwan. In conclusion, the essay addresses how Taiwanese dance theatre deconstructed the official nationalist subjectivity and challenged gender stereotypes, thus confronting the dual structure of autocracy/patriarchy ruling the Taiwan society at the time.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200809-x-161-39-81-a,161,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Whereas zhezi xi (an excerpt) can merelyd epict symptoms, quanben xi (a complete play) is able to cover sociocultural issues and achieves a global viewpoint of pathology by shaping the protagonist with brain diseases.

Moreover, visual art representation has played an important role in their daily life and ritual as well. Based on an analysis of texts of myths and visual art, the article aims to reveal the images and visual representation of human in Paiwan Indigenous culture. With focus on subject of ”human” transcribed in texts, the metaphors, characters, and visualization on human beings and body are categorized, analyzed, and interpreted.
Based on methodology of content analysis, this research is conducted to analyze the traditional myths on human life creation, including stories and tales, and also visual patterns of human figures represented in Paiwan ancestral sculptures, carved artifacts and other art forms. Analytic perspectives of visual theory and notions of literary transtexuality are applied to interpret Paiwan Indigenous myths, artifact and visual art presentation, in which patterns, elements, and composition applied in visual creation of these selected materials are analyzed and compared.
In doing so, this study has a three-fold research purpose: First, it attempts to interpret indigenous visual thinking and representation of concept of the origin, based on contents of oral tradition and visual tradition. Second, it is designed to analyze human factors, such as body proportion, age, gender, feelings, mind, and status. Third, it aims to discuss visual factors of representation, such as formation, action, gestures, and background.

How much can we empathize with our fellow human beings who went through such extreme situations?
This article discusses the International Committee of Memorial Museums in Remembrance of the Victims of Public Crimes (ICMEMO), one of the ICOM committees, and the development and characteristics of the memorial museums in question. Inspired by the ”Anthropological Exhibit-What Is the Human Body?” a special exhibition held by the Musée du Quai Branly in France, this article attempts a preliminary investigation into the cultural relation between the human body and politics in the context of Taiwan' post-ar history. Aided by archives and oral history, it reflects on the treatment of the body and its cultural significance during the February 28 Incident and the subsequent White Terror. It explores aspects that include ”bodies of the oppressed,” ”bodies of 'the other',” ”bodies of free people,” and ”bodies of victims.” Since the Taiwan Historical Memorial Museum is a cultural organization for social interpretation and communication, it ought to take into regard the cultural framework of the victimized bodies. This article concludes with the following two points. 1.We have very limited knowledge of the modern Taiwanese body, particularly the victims' bodies of the February 28 Incidents' and the White Terror, which the goverment considered ”other.” Understanding the resistors' bodies would help us perceive the force behind the democratic movement of the late 1980s. 2. Exhibition of the body is the memor ial museum's cultural representation. Culture is demonstrated in the body. The historical museum should assume a positive, exploratory role in ”body and free thinking.” An important path to take is to establish a cultural research section that interprets the museum’s exhibitions and activities.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200809-x-161-185-263-a,161,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Festivity, Mimesis, and Aesthetics of Inversion: An Analysis of the Operetta Chen San and Wuniang",Mei-Chun Tsuo,"Chen San and Wuniang, Mikhail Bakhtin, Victor Turner, ritual, operetta","The festival troupes in the temple fair parade, such as the chegu and the qixiang, stage amorous operettas such as Chen San and Wuniang in the sacred circumstances of temple fair. On the surface, the plot borders on lasciviousness that merits no further attention. However, when situated in the ritual context, analysis of the performance will unearth rich and valuable symbolic meanings.
The concept of ”texts” referred to in this article pertains to the field of contemporary cultural studies. Stuart Hall and his colleagues at the Contemporary Cultural Research Center have developed a cross-disciplinary research that is different from the traditional textual and literary studies. It distances itself from the text-oriented aspect and turns into a cultural contextual, circumstantial research, bringing in theories of semiology, sociology, political science, feminism, and cultural anthropology to explore the respective meanings the text manifests in different cultural, political, or social situations. It also argues that any construction of textual meanings has to take into consideration the importance of non-textual materials. For example, when undertaking textual analysis of an operetta, one source not only has to investigate the folk aesthetics of the content, such as plot and dialogue, but has also to situate the operetta in the context of the temple fair performances, exploring its system of symbolic meanings to demonstrate its comprehensive significant in the cultural circumstances.
Meanings exist in the never-ending cycles between texts and society. The traditional opera studies analyze a play from the angle of literature. While this approach is capable of exploring deep into the literary characteristics, this literature-only perspective is prone to overlook the bodily feeling, rituals, politics, and community. Therefore, I will analyze the operetta Chen San and Wuniang with a perspective of ritual vs. performance, and give a comprehensive interpretations of its inherent meanings.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200806-x-160-5-74-a,160,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

(Only a handful of koa-a booklets feature solos.) The titles of koa-a booklets and their contents are examined in five aspects to determine which count as banter duets.

The Academia's Influences on the Peking Opera Scripts: A Discussion on Journey through Hell,Hsing-Hui Lin,"GuoGuang Opera Company, Taiwanese Peking Opera, Journey through Hell, Wang An-chi, Peking Opera","This article, based on the script of Journey through Hell, explores the interaction between the academic circle of opera studies and the Peking Opera troupes in Taiwan, and the imprints thereby left on the creation of operatic scripts. First I compare the gist of the original novel and that of the operatic text. Secondly, I discuss the script's innovative designs in terms of the thesis and the structural level. Finally, I analyze the academia's influence on the script composition, as well as the academia's endeavor in cultivating its audience.
When one compares Chen Yaxian's original text with that of Wang An-chi's adaptation, one finds that scholar playwrights lay more emphasis on the philosophical aspect of the script. The cooperation between academia and opera theater circle not only broadens the scope of Peking opera but also sets Taiwanese Opera scripts apart from those of China, both in terms of literary achievement and profundity of thoughts. The new generation of audience, cultivated on campus by the scholars, will possibly determine the future of Peking Opera in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200806-x-160-123-168-a,160,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

It was also the company that pioneered the making of records featuring Taiwan music. The originals of the records that the company issued in colonial Taiwan under the Columbia label are all deposited at the National Museum of Ethnology of Japan and constitute the treasure bank of Taiwan music during the Japanese period.
Since using old records and historical recordings to study Taiwan music history and the social history of music in Taiwan coincides with the current trends in international academic community, this paper first introduces these current trends, then reviews the literature on the study of records issued in colonial Taiwan and gives an overview of the development of Columbia record in Taiwan and its close interaction with Taiwan society. Finally, the paper highlights the significance of Columbia records as the primary sources for Taiwan music history, and then suggests topics for further studies, such as musical genres and repertory, performers, style, musical concept, intertexuality among various musical and operatic genres, the blurred boundaries between performers of traditional music and operas and those of pop songs, the appropriation of Chinese, Japanese, and western musical elements, the close relationship between record and broadcasting industries, Japan's colonial policy and the social change in Taiwan as reflected through Columbia records, the multi-faceted character of Taiwan culture, the intercultural exchanges of the record industries and popular cultures among Taiwan, China, Japan, and the West, the question of musical and cultural identities of Taiwanese people, and so on.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200806-x-160-169-196-a,160,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
An Overview of Yü Dagang's Centennial Anniversary Conference,Chia-Ling Ku,"Chinese opera, Yü Dagang","In May 2007, the Council for Cultural Affairs in Taiwan organized a conference in commemoration of Yü Dagang's Centennial Anniversary. With ”traditional Chinese opera” as its theme, the keynote speech of the conference highlights Yü's contribution to the modernization of Taiwan's traditional operas. It was followed by seven panels on various topics. They are, ”New Materials for the Study of Traditional Operas: New Findings and New Perspectives,” ”Ritual Theatre,” ”The Music in Traditional Opera,” ”Traditional Operas in Taiwan,” ”Theatrical Theory,” ”The Modernization of Traditional Opera,” and ”New Interpretations of Old Operas.” In General, this conference well illustrates the academic endeavor infused in the field in recent years. The key points of the event are 1) with persistent enquiry into ritual theatre, studies of traditional opera explore its origins, which approach has been widely accepted by the academic circle; 2) newly unearthed archaeological findings help reconstruct and enrich our knowledge of the history of theater. In this respect, the so-called ”Shanxi school” still dominates the field; 3) first-hand data collected from field investigation supplement information from existing literature; 4) There are attempts to unearth new information from some long-forgotten literature; 5) while the diversification of theoretical application reflects the inadequate historiography of the theory of traditional opera, it also exposes the researchers' theoretical anxieties; 6) the ten-odd papers on Taiwan's traditional operas indicate that the study of them is gaining strength; 7) the relation between commoners' literature and the construct of a nation is still many scholars' concerns; 8) only through modernization can traditional opera perpetuate and regenerate itself; 9) introduction of new perspectives breathe new life into old styles and old works; 10) reappraisals of the research history include summarizations, reflections, innovations and subversive notions, which means that the research history of traditional theater remains to be re-written.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200806-x-160-197-231-a,160,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Glimmers from a ""Dark Age"": Taiwanese Theater under the Kominka Movement (1936.9~1940.11)",Wan-Shun Shih,"Taiwanese Opera, theater policies, New Theater, the Kominka Movement, the Kominka Drama","The latter period of Japanese colonial rule has long been considered a ”dark age” in the history of Taiwanese theater, when the colonial government cut off Taiwanese theatrical traditions abruptly, and dominated the whole theatrical development with its radical assimilation policy called Kominka. This article reexamines the theatrical activities under the Kominka Movement in its first four years, and focuses its discussion on the following aspects: 1. the formation, transformation and execution of theater policies by the colonial government; 2. the rises and falls among different theater genres during the Kominka Movement, along with their aesthetic evolutions and audience responses; 3. the ideas and strategies of the Kominka Drama.
The development of Taiwanese theater during these four years, as I find, was not in total darkness or stagnation, but underwent at one time or another disruption, fusion and growth. Under the general control of the colonial government, theatrical activities still retained certain degrees of liberty in terms of creativity and marketing. Their changes reflect not only the specific contents of the Kominka Movement, but also the cultural developments in Taiwan under the colonial modernization. They inspired the discussions in 1941 about where Taiwanese theater should go, which led to the revival of the New Theater Movement three years later, and their aesthetic influences extended further into the Taiwanese opera and the New Theater during the postwar period. ”Dark” as it appears, this era carries its underestimated significance in the history of Taiwanese theater, and deserves to be reevaluated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200803-x-159-7-81-a,159,2008,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

"The Golden Cangue, Continuation and Innovation of Traditional Chinese Opera",Hui-Yin Chiu,"Eileen Chang, traditional opera, Peking Opera, The Golden Cangue","To adapt traditional opera to the concerns of modern society so as to maintain its popularity has been a general approach of contemporary dramatists. The newly revised Peking Opera The Golden Cangue employs a ”stringing-pearl” structure scheme to illustrate the life story of Cao Qiqiao, exploring an intricate female mentality and the restlessness of modern lives. Manipulation of the settings between the real/illusional and the synchronic/diachronic generates dramatic effects on stage. Though the adaptation strategy has mostly followed the traditional opera's histrionic formula, in practice, the play exhibits innovations derived from within.
In Eileen Chang's writings, one often finds rich visual details. However, the translation from words to stage performance has to be a recreation between different genres. The differences hence impose a change in representation. In this article, I analyze the narrative structure, stage design, and histrionic formula of The Golden Cangue. This critically-acclaimed play might not solve all the problems encountered in the modernization of traditional opera.

On the Rites of Pilgrimage: A Case Study of Dajia Mazu,Dun-Hou Huang,"grand and lesser ceremonies, Mazu pilgrimage, pilgrimage, Eight Major Rites, sacrifice share","Pilgrimage has been prevalent in Taiwan ever since the Qing dynasty. The Dajia Mazu pilgrimage had persisted for several hundred years and continued to grow into one of the most important pilgrimages in Taiwan. For hundreds of years, pilgrims follow the ”rites” of the ethnic-Han tradition to carry out several ceremonies. The spirit of the ”rites” survives even though the rituals have underwent adaptations and changes to accommodate actual needs. I first postulate in this article that it is with the notions from the Rites of Zhou, instead of the Buddhist notion of ”no killing” that the pilgrims observe abstention on their way down south before Mazu's birthday celebration. The reason why followers who are in mourning refrain from participating in the pilgrimage can also be explained this way. At the end of the birthday celebration, each pilgrim claims a portion of pork from the butcher with a ”sacrifice share” ticket. My second point is that this is a custom that can be traced to the jun notion from the Rites of Zhou, which transmits good fortune to people who share the sacrificial meat. Thirdly, with field investigation and textual research of the Rites of Zhou, I consider the ceremonial steps of the vanguard banners, parasols, and the goddess' palanquin to be equivalent to a bowing greeting with clasped hands (between deities). Lately, the Zhenlan Temple has turned the relatively simple rituals during the pilgrimage into more elaborated ones to accommodate the media's filming need. Chief directors of the Temple specify the more important rituals during the pilgrimage and labeled them ”Eight Major Rites” for the media to cover. Thus I also trace the origins of the ”three kneeling and nine kowtowing” and argue that the current ceremony follow the conventionof dating from the Qing dynasty. The rituals discussed in this article are based on my observation of and interviews with the Dajia Mazu pilgrimage staff. Comparisons with observations recorded in the Rites of Zhou and from other dynasties are also included.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200712-x-158-9-38-a,158,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Reproduction and Invention of Tradition: An Analysis of the Palanquin Performance and the Pilgrim's Experience of Walking in Taiwan's Baishatun Mazu Pilgrimage,Mei-Huan Lu,"pilgrimage, performance, convention, body experience, ritual","As Hobsbawn and Ranger (1983) pointed out, tradition is not only something from the past; it is reproduced and invented in contemporary social and cultural contexts. Focusing on explicating this thesis from the perspective of convention, I have studied two ritual actions in the Baishatun Mazu pilgrimage of Taiwan. The first is the palanquin performance, which is regarded as a performance-oriented ritual, in which people believe that the goddess Mazu descends to the palanquin and makes carriers move through her pulling force. I divide the palanquin performance into two categories: the palanquin oracle that guides the pilgrimage odyssey and the performance for free interpretations. The former contains more conventional forms and meanings in the performance than the latter, albeit both performance categories involve the human interaction and the negotiation of meaning during and after the performance act. The palanquin performance in past pilgrimage journeys places an emphasis on enacting the palanquin oracle to guide the pilgrim’s excursion. The frequency of the performance is largely increased on present journeys, and new forms and interpretations of the performance emerge as well. Drawing on the notion of ritual experience, I see the pilgrimage journey on foot as another kind of ritual action, in which the pilgrim's experience of walking heightens and produces religious meaning. While following Mazu's pilgrimage journey, pilgrims not only place their own bodies in exhausting circumstances like strong sunshine or heavy rain, but also depend on their goddess's protection to release the physical pain resulting from the difficult journey. Both the pilgrim's experience of walking and the carrier's experience of the palanquin performance is viewed as the theophany of their goddess. In this sense, the transcendent power of the pilgrimage representation, originally explicated by Sangren (1991, 1993), can result from the pilgrim's physical experience on the journey (cf. Quintero 2002). The journey on foot was inevitable in the past when transport vehicles were not available, whereas the pilgrims walking on today's excursion are ”pushing their bodies to a state of physical crisis.” This ”physical sacrifice” carries an air of being the indispensable testimony to the pilgrim's belief in Mazu. Thus the journey on foot is a contemporary reproduction of the convention from the past, whose reproduction involves new resources and meanings. Paradoxically, the reproduction and the invention of the tradition in the present have ironically announced the death of the past.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200712-x-158-39-100-a,158,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Though xianghua is a longstanding Buddhist tradition in the county, the scriptural structure of the xianghua rituals prevalent in most parts of the Meizhou was formed only after the Jiaying prefecture had been established. Details of the rituals performed by xianghua Buddhist monks have roots deep and far into history. However, current usage and criterion, such as the common terms for xianghua rituals, ritual structures presented in different occasions and their variations in practice, as well as didactic genre features in the scripture, rhetoric norms, and the oral-transmitted music, singing styles, dance, and artistry are all results of the continuous integration between funeral rites and the Buddhist rituals. I also record one remnant of the Pu'an sect, the Fengshun lamp rite, and the Buddhist ritual pattern of the Meizhou Xiashui area.

The Musical Phenomenum and Social Context of Tao's Anood (Ballad) in an Inaugural Ceremony,Yu-Hsiu Lu,"music of Tao, oral tradition, sociomusicology, inaugural ceremony, anood","The inaugural ceremony of new boots and new houses in Tao society is often held today. In the ceremonies, anood is used. This music, which has short melody and recitative rhythm, consists of three musical phrases-two sentences of lyrics and one sentence of a nonsense vowel. A singer, who wishes to express his concept, will sing more than two sentences and utilizes anood. While repeating of the short anood melody, the second sentence of the last anood will be used as the first sentence of the new anood, and the second sentence of the new anood will be added. In addition, the tempo of the anood in the inaugural ceremony is usually quick. The guests in the ceremony will repeat loudly the melody and the lyrics of the solo singer.
This music phenomenum in melody, rhythm, lyrics and singing reflects the social context of the Tao people. The short and simple melody and the recitative rhythm show the functional purpose of the music. The quick tempo of singing and the loud repeating of the guests show the mutual respect among people in the society.
In addition, lyrics are not written down in the oral tradition. People learn through repeated singing. Because a singer is afraid of forgetting lyrics, he sings the quick anood. The thimble method* can not only calm down the emotion of a singer, but also let a singer think about the next sentence of lyrics. Repeated singing provides also an opportunity for ears and mouths to practice songs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200706-x-156-11-29-a,156,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Whose War History?

Under military rule, social and thought control suppressed the community power of traditional clans and severed their connection with fellow countrymen living abroad. Up until 1992, for 43 long years, not only was civil society highly mobilized for military self-defense, many symbolic landmarks, such as war museums and monuments, were also built to encourage patriotism and to serve as the ideological tool for anti-Communism and military indoctrination.
This paper analyzes the break between the cultural exhibition of war museums and collective memories of local society in battlefield Quemoy. It also discusses how the war museum became an anachronistic embarrassment in the drastically changing circumstances.

Make the Feast Ritual and Let Our Village Go toward the World: The Narration of the Local Elites and the Modernity of Miao,Mei-Ling Chien,"exhibition, cultural revitalization, Miao Hmong, indigenization of modernity, narrative","This paper aims to explore how the ”indigenization of modernity” is experienced and created through the action of speaking (voicing). The focus of this paper is on the Miao local elites, who have served as the ritual heads or the local political leaders in an extensive cultural renewal feast ritual lasting four years (from 2000 to 2003) at an upland Miao village in eastern Guizhou. The linguistic reality and ideology in the contemporary renewal ritual of this local village is especially emphasized in this article. Discarding the Han Chinese's ”discourse of otherness” of the past which tended to mark Miao people as ”feminized keepers of Chinese tradition,” through the ethnographic data gathered in this paper I will show that the local elites of Miao were working actively throughout this indigenization act as the main channels in communicating, passing down, and re-learning the languages and knowledge of this feast ritual. I analyze the vocabulary and phrases used to express their viewpoints and values toward this contemporary renewal ritual. The local elites of the Miao express the dialectical relationship between tradition and modernity through language. The indigenization of modernity displayed through their voicing is a creative linkage of traditional perspectives and modern reality that is then communicated to the outside world by means of cultural exhibitions and ritual performances. This research seeks to convey the richness of the adaptation of the Miao to modernity while preserving traditional village culture and its presentation to themselves and the outside world as an integrated whole. Modernity has brought new challenges and courses of action that have been blended with traditional ritual elements. The Miao people of eastern Guizhou have embraced modernity and made it their own.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200706-x-156-157-203-a,156,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"Reconstructing the Public Space of Ping-pu Tribes in Tainan: A Study of the Form and Transformation of ""Konkai""","Mei-Fang Kuo, Ming-Fu Hsu","transformation, konkai public house, Tainan Ping-pu tribes, symbolic space, central column","This article attempts to reconstruct the traditional form of ”konkai,” the public house of Ping-pu tribes in Tainan, and to trace its transformation in history. According to historical records, the konkai in the 17th century was a multi-functional space that served religious, political, and communal purposes. However, long-term research of konkai since the Japanese colonial years indicates that its functions have now reduced to a religious one; only occasionally does it hold communal activities. Scholars have also generally neglected the reports from sojourning foreigners in the 19th century. Neither did they inquire into the konkai's changes of function and its formal transformation in various stages. As a result, current scholarship regarding konkai is limited to the religious and ritual aspect, as well as the differences between building materials and forms.
Based on extant scholarship and a re-interpretation of available sources, field trips to the existing konkais, and interviews conducted in the villages, the author argues that changes of the functions of konkai resulted from the foreign regime's manipulation, which undermined the close-knit political, religious, and social organization. Functions of konkai were substituted by or disintegrated into village schools, communitive office, and religious spaces (such as churches and temples). The konkai also became office/residence of the tribal chieftains or interpreters. Eventually they were changed into religious/ritualistic space. Furthermore, with influences from Han people's building techniques, the konkai adopted Han-style rooftop and layout. The original sacred symbol-the central column-was either replaced or disappeared. The equal status of the sacrificial platforms was changed to adjust to the Han-style hierarchical arrangement, thus confusing all the spatial order of divine symbol and intermediary supernatural elements. The symbolic meaning of konkai as the epitome of village community faded out, thus came into existence various formation of the current konkai.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200706-x-156-205-281-a,156,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
From Yiren Garden to Yiren Peking Opera Troupe: A Historical Study of a Local Peking Opera Troupe and the Localization of Peking Opera in Taiwan,Ya-Hsiang Hsü,"liantai benxi, Peking opera, native Peking opera troupe, Yiren Peking Opera Troupe, Guangdong Yiren Garden","Studies of Peking opera in Taiwan have witnessed significant breakthroughs in these years. Still, there remain areas where supplements and clarifications are needed for constructing a more fruitful and empirical discourse that will serve to enrich the history of Peking opera in Taiwan. Studies on Peking opera troupes of the Japanese Occupation and post-WWII period are an important subject that nevertheless have long been neglected.
This article examines the Yiren Garden of Guangdong during the Japanese Occupation and the local Yiren Peking Opera Troupe that operated from the post war years up to 1961. Either in terms of their duration of operation, training of local performers. cultivation of local Peking opera audience, or their impact on the condition of Peking opera in Taiwan, studies of the two troupes are most meaningful. They are representative cases of the development and transformation of Peking opera troupes in Taiwan. Through reviewing newspapers of the Japanese Occupation and post WWII period and interviews of the troupe members over a long period of time, this article aspires to supplement, clarify and enrich the extant documentation.
The purpose of this article goes far beyond constructing history of one single theatrical troupe. It further proposes to investigate the internalization process since the Peking opera’s transplantation in Taiwan; and to observe the reaction, interaction, and cooperation of the local Peking opera troupes when they confronted competition from Shanghai Peking opera troupes, non native Peking opera artists and troupes, as well as the Peking opera troupes in the military service.
Therefore, the framework of the present article is first to survey the Guangdong Yiren Garden and the post WWII Yiren Peking Opera Troupe regarding their organization, operation, instructors, performers, repertoire, and theatrical culture. Next, I shall combine my survey with the history of Taiwanese theater, explore the many problems arising from the Peking opera troupes' localization, and offer a new perspective towards where the troupe stands in cultural history.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200703-x-155-5-51-a,155,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
A Discussion on the Development and Transformation of Henan Opera in Taiwan,Chi-Feng Chang,"transformation, traditional opera, development, Henan opera","Transformation of opera genre is fundamental for the growth and development of regional theater. Each singing style possesses unique characteristics. Some blend in with local folk tunes or local operas easily and evolve into new genres, such as the Yiyang singing style. Others feature distinct internal structure that barely allows any integration, such as Kun-qu. Once an alien genre gets imported, over an extensive period of time it would either undergo localization, for instance, the beiguan that came to Taiwan during the Qianlong-jiaqing era: or it would affect the local opera genre, such as Peking opera's influence on koa-a opera.
Once an opera genre was imported into Taiwan, it on the one hand developed within the over all environment, on the other hand went through some transformations. As of today, the Kun opt, Peking opera and Henan opera in Taiwan have shown noticeable stylistic differences in comparison with their counter parts in Mainland China. Since the Henan opera's introduction into Taiwan in 1949, it has carried on its tradition within the special nurturing environment of national policy's sponsorship. In 1996, the Flying Horses Henan Opera Troupe was put under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and renamed ”Henan Opera Troupe of the Guoguang Theatrical Company.” Since then, it has expanded its repertoire, trained new performing artists, and attempted to undertake joint performance projects with mini theaters. In recent years, its performing show on tour to Zhenzhou, Henan, as well as other cities, has presented different performing and staging styles. In this article, I shall investigate the development and evolvement of articulation, musical style, and repertoire of Henan opera in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200703-x-155-53-77-a,155,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
"From ""Refined Gezaixi"" to ""Opela"": Discourses of Gezaixi under the Changing Taiwanese National Identity",Hsiao-Mei Hsieh,"opela, Taiwanese identity, Taiwanese nationalism, gezaixi, Taiwanese opera, Refined gezaixi","This paper examines how and why the mainstream discourse of gezaixi has undergone a shift from the ”refined tradition” to ”local opela” since the 1990s. Even though the Minghuayuan Gezaixi Troupe has been popular island wide with its originality and grassroot charisma since the 80s, the dominant forms of gezaixi in the 90s were the ”refined gezaixi” practiced by Holo Gezaixi Troupe and the ”traditional gezaixi” advocated by the Heritage Award winner Liao Chiung-chi. At this time, ”'opela' was excluded from the mainstream discourse, and ”o-be-pe-pe-le,” meaning doing in a careless and perfunctory way” in Taiwanese, was its definition.
However, opela started to gain public attention in Taiwan since its first entrance on the official stage in the government sponsored relay outdoor performances in 2001. Situated in a historical context, this paper discusses the development of the discourses of gezaixi and how it responds to and interacts with the changing Taiwanese nationalism and identity. I argue that on its way to becoming the legitimate Taiwanese cultural representative, gezaixi first went through an image purging and self healing process: Holo Gezaixi Troupe employs the performance of Peking opera and the scripts written by Chinese playwrights to uplift the image of gezaixi. By recognizing the cultural hierarchy, Holo strives to imitate its idealization (Peking opera) and attempts to replace it. Further, the crisis of homogenization in the age of globalization and the contested Taiwan China' identity have compelled Taiwan to seek its local features and colonial memories. Thus, the hybrid opela has been brought into focus these years.
Widely drawing on literature and performance works, the paper intends to demonstrate the historical process of how these discourses have been constructed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200703-x-155-79-110-a,155,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Taiwanese koa-a opera in the new millennium, on the one hand main tains the tradition repertoire, on the other hand opens up a new arena of multi dimensional development with the encouragement of official cultural policy, establishment of new performance spaces, market oriented considerations, and new attempts originating from theatrical art experiments. These not only expand the operation pattern of occasion incurred contracts, but also bring about diverse theatrical artistic improvement of koa-a opera. As a result of the twofold effect of inner spontaneity outer catalysis, the open- stage joint performances, special performance events opened up by the ”traditional art promotion” and ”temple fair opera repertoire reorganization” compete with the koa-a opera performances in mini theaters or tea houses under the guideline of market orientation and theatrical art exploration. They also complement each other within the multi dimensional socio cultural net work consisting of the performers, production teams, governmental organizations, civil literary institutions, reviewers and the audience. Thus we see remarkable theatrical phenomena that are either similar to or different from the past, such as, professional writing of the administration project, advertisement marketing, dominance of the evaluation mechanism, brand name images, shuffling and re shuffling of the production teams, manipulation of the diffusion of the star effect, interchange between theater and open air stage, opera viewing experience communication, etc.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200703-x-155-111-150-a,155,2007,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Influences of Two Forms of Popular Recreation on Taiwanese Opera: Observations in Tainan and Gaoxiong,Yung-Chang Lin,"popular recreation, opeilabi, koa-a opera, KTV, karaoke","Tastes for recreation among the public are constantly changing. However, two forms of popular recreation in Taiwan have endured the shifting trends and grown ever stronger. They are open stage koa-a opera and karaoke.
The open stage koa-a opera had once been merely a form of festival related performance, which leans heavily on its ritualistic function rather than recreation. Nevertheless, a few koa-a opera troupes from southern Taiwan such as Xiuqin from Tainan, Chunmei from Gaoxiong, and Minghuayuan from Pingdong-have been able to attract a crowd of several hundred people with each performance. Their huge appeal naturally earns the temple administrators' attention. To create an animated and cheerful atmosphere, more and more temples compete to sign up such troupes to perform on their deities' birthdays. Under such circumstances, signing up opera troupes, opera performances and audience form a three way dependency chain. A good opera troupe wins more contracts. To become a good opera troupe, it has to orient its performances according to the public taste. Therefore, the audience's taste determines an opera troupe's style of performances as well as its content.
Karaoke as an recreation form approximately began in the 80s. It was voted as one of the most representative images of Taiwan in 2006. The public's fondness of singing and popular old songs, in a way, influenced the popular tunes of koa-a opera, almost all of them use popular tunes of the old times. Some even sing predominantly such tunes and supplement them with traditional koa-a tunes. It indicates that the karaoke'c influences on koa-a opera deserves our attention.

Survey of the evolution of the puppet theater stages and forms of the puppets is important for comprehending the succession and transition of the jidong puppet theater. The size of jidong puppets shifted from large to small, then small to large. With the changes of the puppets, the stages and lighting also underwent a series of renovations. Changes in the setting of shadow puppet theater are the main reason that induced such modifications.
Current situation of the Jidong shadow puppet theater evinces localized artistic characteristics. No matter in puppet designs, musical styles, organization of the troupes, management, or performances, traditional ways persist in these aspects. Current senior puppeteers had been performers in profession al troupes during the 1960s and 70s. They, as the main force behind the puppet theater development, promoted the renovations of the folk puppet theater. With the impact from the dominant modern recreation culture and the gaps between the age of both audiences and puppeteers, the chance of survival for the shadow puppet theater is ever shrinking.

It was widely believed in the general public and government officials that this street opera, performed in various Chinese dialects, had been entering an audience less age. Since the 1980s, however, the Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Temple has become the Chinese temple receiving the best financial patronage and attracting the largest audience because of its frequent scheduling of Chinese opera. In a country where young people mostly receive English education and where Chinese tradition is on the wane, it is remarkable that the Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Temple set a record of staging opera in 100 consecutive days for one single festival.
This paper examines Lorong Koo Chye Sheng Hong Temple as a case study and considers the following issues from the perspective of ”theatrical patronage,” for example, the functions of the street opera, the audiences and the patronage of the opera and its influences, if the patronage changes from time to time. In addressing these issues, I respond to the prevalent discourse of ”how could an audience less theatrical performance he called theatre?” and give a more accurate and fair evaluation of the Street opera.

A Study of Minnan Taoist Priests in Singapore: Their Professional Networks and Links to Local Communities,Sze-Wei Koh,"relationships, Singapore, Taoist priest, communities, Minnan","Early Singapore was made up of Chinese immigrants from different sub ethnic groups who possessed a wide range of traditional customs and practices. Despite urbanization, many members of Singapore's ethnic Chinese community still believe in Taoism. As a result, Taoist priests, as ”ritual specialists”, are indispensable for the performance of rites like the consecration of temples and other communal sacrifices. Taoist priests from Singapore's Minnan (Hokkien) sub ethnic group constitute this nation's largest and most diverse community of Taoist specialists.
This study aims to explore the internal composition of Minnan Taoist networks, paying particular attention to different schools and lineages, as well as their historical development. It also intends to highlight the internal structures of these networks, as well as their external relationships with the Minnan Chinese community. To gather first hand information, the paper utilizes data collected during field research to present case studies of three Taoist altars-the Hunyuan daotan, Gaoji daotan and Baoying fatan-and their priests. In addition, the paper will also examine the lineages and manuscripts of leading Taoist schools in Singapore. A detailed discussion of the Sanyuan School will argue that this school, which is unique to this part of the world, belongs to the Fazhugong branch of the Lushan School.

Such places were usually referred to as ”zahadi” (literally ”motley areas”). In China's venerable capital of Beijing, the relationship between the inner city (neicbeng) and outer city (waicbeng) was conceived of in terms of urban physiology as resembling the upper and lower parts of the human body. Such a metaphor finds clear expression in the centrally located area between the Forbidden City and the Sky Bridge (Tianqiao) district, both of which lie along Beijing's meridian. During the modern era, a relationship of mutual growth and reflection shaped the historical development of these two areas and their residents. This paper describes the formation of the spatial characteristics of Beijing's Sky Bridge district, using interrelated action performances and standards of language to explore how its residents' feelings of structure have emerged. In addition, it adopts a methodological point of view to interpret the meaning and value of zabadi, which is expressed in indigenous terms for private parts (literally ”xiati” or lower body) that portray modern Chinese urban space from a physiological view expressed by its heterogeneous inhabitants.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200612-x-154-201-252-a,154,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Resident Specialists and Temple Managers in Late Imperial China,Vincent Goossaert,"miaozhu, Buddhists, Taoists, zhuchi, temple managers","This article deals with the religious specialists (Buddhists, Taoists, spirit-mediums) who were hired during the late imperial period to live permanently within temples and provide regular services there. A temple did not absolutely need resident religious specialists to operate properly on a regular basis (temple leaders could instead invite specialists to perform rituals during festivals), and most did not have one. Among the temples that could afford to hire a temple manager, some temple leaders chose not to hire anyone; others chose to employ a cleric (Taoist or Buddhist), called zhuchi, while yet others chose to employ a lay manager, called miaozhu. This article uses inscriptions, legal documents, and narrative sources to describe the variety of relationships between lay leaders and hired resident specialists, and discusses the reasons-social, economical, and theological-behind such choices. It examines the ritual roles, contractual rights and duties, and patterns of recruitment and succession among employed zhuchi and miaozhu. It argues that the basic patterns of relationships and contractual agreements between lay leaders and their hired managers formed a repertoire of social know-how that could be found throughout China, as documented by instances of very similar contracts and regulations from different regions. Zhuchi and miaozhu idioms, embedded in a legal and contractual framework, were part of a China-wide repertoire of temple management, put to use in different ways in each local system and each individual temple community.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200609-x-153-25-68-a,153,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

"""Superstition Specialist Households""? The Household Idiom in Chinese Religious Practices",Adam Yuet Chau,"Daoist priests, the household idiom, religious specialists, ritual jamming, superstition","This article examines the role of the householder religious service provider and the household idiom in the overall field of religious practice in China. First I will look at the emergence of a new label, superstition specialist households (mixin zhuanyehu), in the PRC, and attempt to situate this emergence within the socio-economic and political context of reform-era China. This label shows how the Chinese party-state now conceptualizes ritual specialists such as spirit mediums, yinyang masters, fortune-tellers, and others who make a living in the popular religious realm (including folk musicians and opera performers who perform at temple festivals, temple caretakers, non-monastic Buddhist and Daoist ritualists, votive offering manufacturers, etc.). Though sardonic and condemnatory in tone, this appellation also puts these people in the larger category of getihu (private business households), whose existence is not only legitimate but even celebrated in reform-era China. I then present a couple of vignettes from my ethnographic fieldwork in Shaanbei (north-central China) to illustrate how householder religious service providers typically work (one vignette on a spirit medium; the other on a yinyang master). While operating upon very different principles yinyang masters rely on esoteric knowledge and ritual orthopraxy, whereas spirit mediums rely on deity power and efficacy both kinds of ritual specialist are religious entrepreneurs taking full advantage of the ”household idiom,” in contradistinction to affiliation with formal institutions such as monasteries, temples, or guilds. Next I look at what I call ”ritual jamming,” referring to the ad hoc coming together of householder ritualists to stage larger rituals in response to some clients' more elaborate needs. I also examine the household idiom and see what advantages it has over the corporatist idiom in terms of ritual service provision at the grassroots level, as well as its ability to weather political suppression. I conclude by offering some speculative comments on the probable future of the household idiom in Chinese religious culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200609-x-153-157-202-a,153,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Ritual Leaders in North China Local Communities in the Twentieth Century: A Report on Research in Progress,Daniel L. Overmyer,"temple festivals, rain rituals, ritual leaders, local community","The topic of this research note is part of a book-length project now in progress, entitled ”Local Religion in North China: the Structure and Organization of Community Rituals and Beliefs,” for which I have been observing, collecting and reading since 2000. Most of my material is about such traditions in Hebei, Shanxi and Shandong, with some evidence as well from Shaanxi and other areas. This material indicates that local religion is deeply institutionalized in village and district society, organized and paid for by the people themselves for their own purposes. Those who would like to see a detailed outline of this project can contact me at eodano@shaw.ca.
In north China, the most important community rituals are those in honor of the birthdays of local protective deities to invoke their protection for another year, and rituals to petition for rain. These rituals are organized and carried out by village leaders in cooperation with those who have specific ritual duties and roles, such as yinyang masters, zhuli; those in overall charge of the rituals, such as xiangtou (incense heads), spiritmediums, etc.; as well as specialized participants, such as tingshi, weishi, qianhang, and shenjia, respectively bearers of images and offerings for them, bearers of ritual umbrellas to protect the offerings, leaders of opera troupes, and leaders of ”godly families” who recite the names of the gods. These ritualists begin practicing for their roles weeks or months before the ceremonies begin. There is evidence for the participation in some vil-lage rituals of Buddhist monks and Daoist priests, but for the most part the leaders in these rituals are lay people from the village or its surrounding area. Of course, even when priests are present they have been invited by village leaders to perform specific ritual functions. Some Daoists are described as married farmers who live in a local temple. It is possible that more clergy were involved in the past, but many of the monasteries and temples in which they would have lived have been destroyed, particularly since the late 19th century. This research note will describe the roles and activities of local ritual leaders by geographical areas and types of ceremonies, and note their contributions to the order, structure, and inner logic of community festivals.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200609-x-153-203-263-a,153,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

This arose as a result of the house building by influential families. At that time, the craftsmen of major carpentry (tamutchiang) and minor carpentry (shiaumutchiang) were mostly invited from Fujian and Guangdong Provinces (Tangshan) to supervise the house construction and furniture making. All the materials of woodwork were imported at great cost from the southeast coast of China. Therefore, both the religious woodwork and ordinary furniture popular in the Ta-hsi region were modeled after the styles prevailing in Tangshan, the motherland.
After 1895 when Taiwan was ceded to Japan, the colonial government imported Japanese and Western cultures to Taiwan and accordingly Ta-hsi's woodwork production changed gradually in terms of construction, industry culture, and styles. During the colonial rule, a mixed style of multi-culture replaced the traditional Chinese monotype adopted in the last century. In the first half of the 20th century, the traditional woodwork production in Ta-hsi, by means of mechanic assistance, importation of new decorative materials, and the setup of transportation system, turned to a new epoch featuring division of labor as well as mass production.
From the late Ch'ing period to the colonial rule, the art of woodcraft of Ta-hsi having been passed down from generation to generation for one hundred years, developed into a systematic cultural form. Then during the 1960s through the 1970s, the woodwork production of Ta-hsi as both tangible and intangible cultural heritage, was transformed into a dynamic art form. This paper aims to discuss the origin and development of the woodcraft production of Ta-hsi before 1945 when it reached its zenith. It will analyze the evolution of characteristics of Ta-hsi's woodcraft from the late Ch'ing period to the colonial rule in its social, religious, cultural and artistic context, so as to demonstrate the close connection between the townspeople's life and woodwork production.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200606-x-152-9-84-a,152,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

It also looks into the social factors that affect the relationship between temples and inhabitants in a neighborhood. In order to address these issues, I have chosen two districts to make a comparative analysis. The two districts are east (old urban area) and west (new center of finance, consumption and culture) which differ distinctly in landscapes, features of area and structures of population. By field research and interviewing with sixty heads of sub-districts and thirty-two managers of Earth God Temples as well as comparing practices of city planning (都市計畫) and population structure in these two districts, we find there are still many Temples and worship zones in operation in the urban area, but the model of operation is actually different from that in tradition society. This is caused by two factors: the policy of government and the change of population. The former changes not only the inhabitants' local identity but also the distribution of the temples in the urban area. The latter changes the social mobility of the inhabitants, and hence the interaction between temples and inhabitants.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200606-x-152-85-137-a,152,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
Postpartum Rest and Postpartum Rest Center: A New Industry from Old Custom,Chi-Ping Huang,"postpartum rest center, postpartum rest, nourishment diet, taboo, folk","The postpartum rest is a ceremonial behavior for all women of Han-Chinese people after childbirth. This custom is still observed by people today in spite of the social changes. This paper reviews the traditional folk taboos and the concept of nourishment diet and discusses the modern methods of postpartum rest and the operation of newly risen industry of postpartum rest centers.
The folk taboos of postpartum rest are summarized in this paper into 32 items in 5 categories, and we try to analyze the rationalities of these taboos. Furthermore, the traditional folk taboos and the concept of nourishment diet are examined from the modern perspectives. This paper also investigates the relationship between this custom and the postpartum centers, and the reasons of their success.
The postpartum rest is a cultural heritage, which combines folk taboos with the concept of nourishment diet. This paper shows that the postpartum rest centers practise innovative variations of the traditional postpartum rest, and they not only successfully carry on the postpartum rest folk custom but also meet the demands of modern life style.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200606-x-152-139-174-a,152,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

It deals with the transformation of xianghua in the Buddhist context. The professionalization of xianghua and its status as part of the cultural legacy are given special attention. The development of xianghua had much to do with the repeated revival of Buddhism in Meizhou. It was also closely related to the religious practitioners and their changing ways of life over the years. The transformation of the xianghua ritual was also the result of the interaction among Buddhist and political systems as well as religious policies.

The troupe was composed of young men from well-to-do families and performed pei-kuan. It was affiliated with the village temple. On the birthday of the deity, it offered theatrical performance to pay its respect. In this way the troupe members participated in the affairs of the village and promoted good relationship among the villagers. In its heyday, the Hsin-lo Hsuan was invited to perform in Chang-hua by devotees of Ma-tsu from the Nan-yao temple in Chang-hua. Besides, it was also supported by the Hots'uo lineage, and so it played musical pieces on the occasion of rituals organized by lineage members. In the industrial society very few young people are willing to learn pei-kuan and old masters have passed away one after another.

The Classification System of Nanguan Songs and Its Functions,Ying-Fen Wang,"classification system, nanguan, tune families and tunes, music cognition","Classification is one of the basic survival skills for homo sapiens. Using this as the basic premise, this paper investigates the vital roles played by nanguan song classification system in nanguan musicians' cognition and in the working mechanism of nanguan musical culture. It first proposes that the classification system of nanguan songs consists of four main categories of tune families (mentou) and their subordinate tunes (paiming). Then it shows that the nascent form of the classification system already existed in the nanguan songbooks in the early 17(superscript th) century and continued to develop to its present scale through the efforts of nanguan musicians in the past few centuries. This paper then goes on to investigate the roles that the system plays in the creation, performance, learning, and appreciation of nanguan music. In terms of creation, the system provides the basis for the creation of new pieces and new tune families, and such creative process persists to the present despite the many innovative attempts made by musicians in the past few decades to ”reform and improve” nanguan by changing its instrumentation and performance format or style. In terms of performance, nanguan musicians need to acquire knowledge about the tune families and tunes in order to be able to realize the pipa melody recorded in nanguan songbooks into actual music; in addition, the classification system provides the framework for the so-called ”paimentou” (performing tune families) in traditional nanguan concerts in the choices and ordering of the pieces to be performed. In terms of learning, the system serves as the foundation for the teaching and studying of nanguan; moreover, the traditional concerts and the basic five or eight song suites familiarize musicians with the tune families and tunes of the system. In terms of appreciation, musicians depend on their knowledge about the system to evaluate other musicians' artistry and their mastery of nanguan musical theory. In short, this paper proposes that tune families and tunes constitute the basic identifying feature of nanguan music, and that the classification system of these tune families and tunes functions as the core of the operative mechanism of the nanguan musical culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200606-x-152-253-297-a,152,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Shuo-shu (Story-telling) in Zhangzi and Its Tendency of Dramatization,Yan-Qin Zhang,"tendency of dramatization, shuo-chang, shuo-shu story-telling in Zhangzi","Shuo-shu (story-telling) is a form of folk art, which was very popular in Zhangzi of Shangdan area (in Changzhi City, Shanxi Province). It came into being in the early 19th century, in the pattern of story-telling and singing, usually by one person. It later developed into a group of eight people including tellers and players, performing by telling stories, singing and acting, accompanied by various musical instruments such as drums, jianban and huhu.
Through years, story-telling in Zhangzi underwent many changes in its forms and ways of presentation. Its tendency of dramatization became more and more obvious, and it finally developed into traditional opera. But as a form of folk art, story-telling has attracted little attention from either government or researchers. In spite of the fact that written records and research materials are rather short on this subject, the author of this article, basing herself on the result of one-year field research, tries to give an overall discussion on the origin, development, forms of performing, artistic characteristics, theatrical tendency, music and script of the shuo-shu in Zhangzi, and thus illustrates its significance and influence on Chinese traditional opera.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200603-x-151-31-96-a,151,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

The sai ritual would be conducted three days, with respectively tou-chang (beginning ritual), zheng-chang (ritual proper), and mo-chang (final ritual) on each day. Before xiang sai there were rituals of inviting and greeting the deities, which would take two days. After the sai, there was a ritual to send off the deities, which would take one day. Thus, the whole festivals lasted for six days.

Types of Opera Performed by Fu-zhou Troupes in Taiwan during the Japanese Occupation,Fang-Long Lu,"Min Opera, jü-zhong, Hui Opera, Japanese Occupation, Fu-zhou Ban, Peking Opera in Taiwan","This paper discusses mainly what jü-zhong (types of opera) the Fu-zhou Ban (troupes of Fu-zhou) performed in Taiwan during the Japanese Occupation. Not until the mid-20(superscript th) century was the term jü-zhong clearly defined, and at that time, zhu-qiang he-yan (troupes giving performances of different dramatic genres) was quite common for troupes. Based on investigation into literature and historical sources, I find that the Fu-zhou Ban which came to Taiwan in the early Japanese Occupation actually showed the traits of Fu-zhou Jing-ban, which means they performed Peking Opera because actors from Fu-zhou and Shanghai performed together, and Peking and Hui Opera were presented on the same stage. Accordingly, I propose that Peking Opera made its first appearance in Taiwan during the period when Liu Ming-chuan was the Governor, further inferring that in the late 1880s there should have been performances of Peking Opera, with a trend formed in the 1890s, which formed the basis of commercial theater later during the Japanese Occupation as the viewers gradually increased. Afterwards, troupes performing Hui-xi (Hui Opera) withered in local Fu-zhou while Fuzhou-xi (Min Opera) thrived, and so the Fu-zhou Ban coming to Taiwan after 1923 were Fu-zhou-xi troupes. However, there were still traces about Fu-zhou-xi performed in manderin then, and the troupes did have records of performing Peking Opera. Moreover, the martial performances of Fu-zhou-xi were all inherited from Peking Opera. It is with these close connections with Peking Opera that the term Fu-zhou Peking Opera Troupes is accepted and adopted.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200603-x-151-145-184-a,151,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"
The Development of Modern Taiwanese Theatre from 1945 to 1949,Shu-Chi Chuang,"Taiwanese theatre, cinema advertisements, modern theatre, new drama","From August 1945 when Japan surrendered to 1949, Taiwan experienced a drastic change and transformation in politics, economy, society, and culture. As an element of culture, theatre reflected the complexity of this change. During these four years, the Chinese nationalist government took over the island from Japan. However, some Japanes people and their opera troupes still stayed in Taiwan. Meanwhile, actors, actresses and opera troupes from Mainland China came to Taiwan. Taiwanese people also formed their opera troupes. The diversified stage activities in Taiwan flourished.
Modern theatre in both Taiwan and Mainland China were enlightened by Japanese theatre. Even during the period of Japanese occupation, Taiwan kept communicating and exchanging with Mainland China. However, the Pacific War in 1937 blocked the traffic between Taiwan and Mainland China, and their developments of theatre went separate ways henceforth. After World War Ⅱ ended in 1945, Taiwanese theatre began a new phase in its history. Unfortunately, due to political reasons and long lapse of time, we are unable to gather complete information about the impact Taiwanese theater received and the changes it underwent during those four years. This article tries to reconstruct the situation of Taiwanese theatre during that time, on the basis of the information from the cinema advertisements, reviews and reports in contemporary newspapers. It is hoped that the study of those four years after World War Ⅱ will illustrate its connection to the period of the Japanese Occupation in regard to the development of Taiwanese theatre.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10251383-200603-x-151-185-252-a,151,2006,"Journal of Chinese Ritual, Theatre and Folklore"

Constructing the “Community” and its Shifting Boundary: A Study on the Mazu Pilgrimage of Baishatun,Mei-huan Lu,"community, identity,symbol, boundary, pilgrimage","”Community” is a cultural construction, it can refer to a social entity bounded to a territory, it can also refer to any kind of de-territorialized or re-territorialized human affiliations. Olwig (2002) has proposed to approach community by examining different social fields of the human affiliation that can provide people with a sense of shared belonging. Studying the pilgrim’s group from Baishatun, located on the northwestern coast of Taiwan, I regard the goddess Mazu as a religious symbol that has the force to congregate all believers to participate in the religious journey. Because of the common voyaging experience and religious sentiments, pilgrims from different origins assert a sense of belonging to this Mazu cult and also claim a sort of identity. However, this identity has been constructed in diverse situations, in which some distinctions can be made between “we-group” and “theygroup”. us, four kinds of communities can be discerned. (1)e territory-bound community refers to the cult area where the goddess’s temple is centered. (2)e homeland community associates the emigrants with the residents under a notion of homeland based on the relationships of kinship, property, and religious activity. (3)e religious community includes all Mazu believers who share the common experience and the religious sentiment of the pilgrimage journey. (4)e imagined community can be formed by way of films of the pilgrimage and the communication via internet discussion boards, in which the common sentiment and experience of the pilgrimage journey is always asserted. A religious symbol held in common does not necessarily contain the same connotation for everyone, because “communality” does not mean uniformity in essence, but the similarity of the symbolic form. Identifying with the goddess Mazu in Baishatun, people with diverse religious concepts and ritual practices claim a sense of belonging and construct different kinds of communities focused on common residence, homeland, pilgrimage and belief in Mazu. Overlapping affiliations to different communities are possible. is phenomenon can be explained by the concept of family resemblance, whose logic of analogy allows people without many similarities to connect to the community base under certain circumstances. In this way, there exists a large space for the agent’s active selection. Owing to the multiple possibilities for human affiliation to form a community, the boundary of these communities is always shifting from one situation to another.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205535366005225,6.1,2008,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

In so doing, it explores the changing functions and meanings of the Tianhou (the queen of heaven) cult, which has been popular in south China, different historical contexts within a single community. It shows that the legends related to the four temples, which were, according to the local people, built in different phases of the community’s history, represent the characteristics of local society in different times. is study shows that decoding the legends of the Mazu goddess’s efficacy can help us to understand the history of local community in a county that has a long documented history. It also tries to explain that the “invisible hand” of history may have “selected” the contents of legends that matched what had really happened, preserving them in the long river of history. e force behind such a process, in effect, is people’s “collective memory” about their community. We can see from the story of Zhanglin that “collective memory” is different among different groups of people. Effectively, it represents different people’s feelings and understandings about their communities. erefore, our understanding of temple legends is actually an understanding of different groups of people’s “collective consciousness” about their community.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205535366005225,6.1,2008,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

We can still see the grave in the temple nowadays. In this essay, we try to figure out the social and cultural implication behind this story. First of all, we find that people burying a corpse found on the beach and establishing a temple for him (or her) is a common religious model in the Mazu Islands. Further, we argue that this kind of religious model represents a distinguishing characteristic of small island societies in southeast coastal China. ese societies are relatively marginal and unstable. is religious model reflects the struggle over self-identity in these societies.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205535366005225,6.1,2008,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Some Observations on the Spatial Characteristics of Official Tian Hou Temples in Taiwan,Kun-chen Chang,"Mazu, Tian Hou Temple, Official Worshiping Building, Qing Dynasty, Taiwan","Mazu媽祖, the goddess of sea, not only symbolically protects fishermen and sailors, but also officially serves as a prototype of worship for praying for safety from disaster and disease during the Qing Dynasty.

The turn to the local in Taiwan is both a reflection of changing political terrain that has prompted an inward search for local cultures and a response to market pressure. While local places are fertile ground for the formulation of a Taiwan-centered consciousness, once commodified, localities are consumed for something beyond nation-building. e visitors used Shenkeng as a stage on which to partake in a game of social positioning by displaying their local and translocal knowledge, by asserting definitions of good taste, and by performing the role of the well-informed consumers. In the deliberate search for a past-in-the-present, the culinary map, environmental consciousness, and understanding of Taiwan’s geography they demonstrated in the course of the trip, the visitors affirmed themselves as a different kind of Taiwanese, one who can traverse localities and cultivate a cosmopolitan awareness of the exotic, the authentic, and the irony of an impossible authenticity.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540417203660,7.1,2009,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
“Never Again”: Narratives of Suffering and Memory of the 9/21 Earthquake in Taiwan﹡,Shaw-wu Jung,"narrative, language, discourse analysis, suffering, the 921 earthquake","A paradigm shift of the features of narrative from the structural view of language of representing reality to the constructionist one of creating reality primarily emphasizes language not only as a conveyor of structure, but as a practice of initiating normalcy as well as ruptures. This theorizing about language practice can be adopted to clarify the relation of language to suffering precisely because language may be available to cope with suffering while still unable to reveal it wholly. Expressing the emotions of pain means to establish varied links with linguist forms. Even silence and no language point to a discourse strategy that accommodates and resists existing social forces. In keeping with the idea of language as practice, this article examines narratives about the 9/21 earthquake in Taiwan as articulating life experiences against the realities of social structure. I will look at personal stories as a form of social action, a cultural resource, and a subset of socio-cultural practice.

Stories Have Histories: Reflections on the Personal in Personal Storytelling,Peggy J. Miller,"narrative, genre, cultural practices, socialization, life course","In this paper I reflect on the personal in personal storytelling, drawing upon Bakhtin and allied theoretical perspectives in anthropology and cultural psychology. These perspectives converge on the idea that stories are not only forms of representation but also sociocultural practices. Stories do more than evoke events in temporal sequence: they have histories in people’s lives. I explore this idea via examples of three oral narrative genres collected as part of ethnographic work in several culturally and ethnically diverse sites. Stories of personal experience and life stories are explicitly “personal” in that the narrator casts the story in the firstperson, but stories of vicarious experience invoke (in the third-person) a story about someone else’s experience. Yet vicarious tellings are also personal in that they reflect and create bonds between teller and listener. Building on this point, I argue that any story—a written story, a news story, a story from television—can be personalized via contact with stories of personal experience. Such personalized reworkings of narratives occur across the life course and across cultural groups. is process of personalization via personal storytelling helps illuminate a key problem in psychological anthropology and cultural psychology, namely, the co-creation of person and culture.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540417203660,7.1,2009,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Exploring the Meaning of Genre in Two Indian Performance Traditions,Susan Snow Wadley,"genre, performance, singing, painting, India","Two performance traditions found in modern India raise questions about the ways genres are transformed by changing social, cultural, and economic circumstances. Using the examples of Dhola, an oral epic from the Braj region of northern India and patas, scroll/songs from West Bengal, this paper examines both the traditional and modern meanings of genre via these two traditions. The Dhola functions much like a novel, a heterogeneous compilation of secondary genres including song, chant, narration, reported speech, and more. Now Dhola is found on audio-cassettes and DVDs, shifting its performance style and content away from the oral performance on a village verandah while adding new secondary genres and new content. The pata (plural for ease for English readers, patas), traditionally a performed sung scroll, presented a unity of illustrated scroll and song, which has disappeared as the scroll alone has become a commodity sold to urban Indians and tourists to be hung on their walls as folk art. Exploring both the patas and Dhola over time—in print, oral performance, audio-cassette, or museum exhibitions—leads to an understanding of the ways genres are grounded in social practice. These two traditions, sharing a worldview from below (both are products of marginalized lower castes), allow us to explore the intersections of social value, linguistic and painted conventions, and the world thus portrayed.

Following Farnell and Varela’s notion of dynamic embodiment (2008), which conceives the moving body as a “cultural way of being human,” and Japanese philosophical notions such as “field of relation,” I analyze the process of embodiment in dancing within Taketomi communities, which leads the islanders through different categories of cultural beings, from uchina (the Okinawans), odoriko (the dancers), to yaninchu (the family). Through my consideration of this dynamic embodiment, I suggest how the significant transformative process of “being Taketomian” can be realized through bodily practice such as dancing among both native islanders and newcomers, as well as the nature of self-socio existence in a unique cultural world.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540450120117,7.2,2009,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Bodily Cultivation and Cultural Learning: The Art of Tea,Shuenn-Der Yu,"cultural learning, bodily cultivation, tea, art of tea, bodily elegance","In this paper I use the example of mastering the art of tea, or chayi, in a Taipei tea group to illustrate how the body acts as a mode for cultural learning. I argue that the body is not only an agent for experiencing, but also a key factor in the embodiment of cultural concepts. How such concepts are learned is strongly connected to one’s ability or sensibility in experience and performance, both of which are acquired through culturally determined forms of bodily cultivation. Efforts to master chayi serve as concrete demonstrations of how bodily sensations, values, meanings, and cultural knowledge become internalized—an important step in the process in which such knowledge is transformed into social and cultural agency",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540450120117,7.2,2009,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Cultivating the Ethnographer’s Ear,Mei-ling Chien,"senses, bodily cultivation, apprenticeship, fieldwork, Hmub","Throughout the history of anthropology, fieldwork has stood at the center of our discipline. In this article I argue that fieldwork not only produces anthropological knowledge, but also engages the ethnographer in cultivating specific bodily experiences, personal emotions, and the professional self or identity. I will discuss my ethnographic apprenticeship, studying Miao (Hmub) courtship in a village in Guizhou, to recount my sense of learning and understanding human experience and social construction in that cultural context. By reflecting on my bodily cultivation during fieldwork, especially the processes of listening and writing, both key experiences of a field ethnographer, I explore how the interaction between what I heard and wrote during my observations transformed my internal understanding of both the specific culture and my self. It was not simply the content or sonic patterns of late-night knocks on windows that inscribed meaning, but the hearing experience that linked personal emotions and transformed them as they related to my identity as a fieldworker. That knocking made it possible for me to move from a sense of culture shock, fear, and dislocation to one of familiarity and sympathy with the emotional worlds of young Hmub girls.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540450120117,7.2,2009,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Bodily Cultivation and Namelessness in the Lao Tzu,Liang Ting,"Lao Tzu, self-cultivation, body, namelessness, name","This article discusses Laozi’s concept of namelessness (wuming 無名 ) and his theory of bodily cultivation. The issue of bodily cultivation in ancient China is an issue of self-cultivation (xiushen 修身 ) and is an important one in Chinese culture. Laozi proposes the very interesting idea of namelessness as the key to self-cultivation. Laozi considers that the worst problems in life come from desires, hence, the aim of self-cultivation is to diminish desires to reach the state of desirelessness. Since desires derive from colorful, tangible objects, Laozi believes that the way to obtain a state of desirelessness is through cultivating mindful namelessness. As objects obtain objective existence and become sources of desire through the process of naming and differentiation, Laozi argues that stopping the process of naming (to reach “namelessness”) would result in the non-differentiation of objects and thus desirelessness.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540450120117,7.2,2009,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Desert and Spring: Reading a Saint’s Body through the Intertextual Encounter between a Christian Ascetic Life and Daoist Utopian Writing,Yi-Jia Tsai,"asceticism, bodily cultivation, The Life of Antony, “Peach Blossom Spring”, comparative studies","This paper juxtaposes Athanasius’s hagiography of Saint Antony and Tao Yuan-ming’s poem “Peach Blossom Spring” to create an intertextual reading of Christian ascetic life. I use four dialectical threads-disclosedness/inaccessibility, similarity/ difference, unmindfulness/discrimination, and exile/sociality-to analyze the Daoist world ideal and Christian ascetic practice. This intertextual strategy allows me to explore how desert asceticism is exemplified in various techniques, as well as how religious ideas and physical experiences are intertwined. The primary goal is to examine how religious ideas of renunciation, Christ imitation, redemption, and resurrection are embodied in the practices of fasting, solitude, fighting demons, and performing miracles. The meanings of the ascetic, perfect, redeemed, and social body are also discussed.

The Anthropologist without a Village: Reflections on the Work of G. William Skinner,Donald R. DeGlopper,"social science, area studies, history of anthropology, regional systems, exposition","This paper is in part an exercise in academic filial piety, but its larger goal is to assess the published work of G. William Skinner, a fairly uncommon anthropologist. He was an anthropologist without a village, who identified himself as a social scientist first and an anthropologist second. His work ignored disciplinary boundaries, which may in part be attributed to his education in colleges and departments that stressed area studies and interdisciplinary approaches, as well as to his choice of research topics. Much of his work, although based on data from China, is not limited to that society and should apply equally well to any society with a market economy but little or no mechanized transport. It should thus have much to offer to anthropology in general. I suggest that one reason for what seems to be its limited influence is the paradoxical idiosyncrasy of Skinner’s work. Although it aspires to be impersonal and objective social science, it all strikes me as extremely distinctive and personal. That strong and original personality is reflected in the work. In some of his published work, the exposition of complexity may trump clarity and so deter some readers.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540466672062,8.1,2010,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
G. William Skinner’s Spatial Analysis of Complex Societies: Its Importance for Anthropology,Lawrence W. Crissman,"periodic markets, Central Place Theory, Regional Systems Analysis, physiographic macroregions, Hierarchical Regional Space","This paper is limited to a discussion of G. William Skinner’s spatial analysis of modernizing agrarian societies, China in particular, which began in the mid-1960s and continued throughout the remainder of his long career. The first of his publications in his new area of research was the groundbreaking series of three articles on “Marketing and Social Structure in Rural China” that appeared in the Journal of Asian Studies (1964, 1965a, 1965b). Therein he presented diagrammatic models for the spatial organization of the three levels of periodic marketing communities that he had identified as the basic economic, social, and cultural building blocks of traditional rural Chinese society. A decade or so later he introduced the next phase in his spatial research on China, which he termed “Regional Systems Analysis” in his contributions to The City in Late Imperial China (1977). In that volume, he introduced his conceptualization and delimitation of agrarian China’s physiographic macroregions, which typically occupied large river drainage systems but were structured economically, politically, and socially by seven-level hierarchies of city systems that sat on top of the three levels of rural market towns. In the late 1980s, and continuing into the new century, Skinner embraced GIS technology which allowed him to greatly expand the scope and complexity of his analysis of what he termed “Hierarchical Regional Space” based on 1990 and 2000 PRC census materials. The paper concludes with a discussion of the scientific nature of Skinner’s work on spatial analysis and its contributions to anthropology",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540466672062,8.1,2010,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Lessons for General Social Theory in the Legacy of G. William Skinner from the Perspectives of Gregory Bateson and Terence Turner,P. Steven Sangren,"cybernetics, nested hierarchy, Chinese society, systems theory, regional analysis","It cannot be said that G. William Skinner’s legacy has failed to receive the attention it deserves – indeed, it is widely recognized by sociologists, historians, and anthropologists as among the most important bodies of work in the study of China. Skinner’s methodological caveats with respect to controlling for hierarchically structured social space and temporally patterned social time (i.e., cycles) and his massive efforts to discern order in intimidatingly complex Chinese social process and history have set a widely emulated, although seldom achieved standard. Nonetheless, important lessons for social theory at more abstract and general levels in Skinner’s work remain largely unrecognized – to some degree even by Skinner himself. To demonstrate this point, I call attention to unexpected analogies to Skinner’s most general visions of social process in the works of anthropologists Gregory Bateson and Terence Turner. Specifically, Bateson’s attempts to discern social life, evolutionary processes, and individual psychology as linked or “nested” cybernetic learning systems invite reconsideration of Skinner’s work. Turner’s Marxian-inspired analyses of small-scale societies as “recursively hierarchical” systems of social production and reproduction envision a part-whole/local-encompassing dialectic that has important affinities to Skinner’s overarching view of China. Building upon these similarities, I argue that they suggest nothing less than a thoroughgoing critique and reconsideration of fundamental categories of social and cultural analysis, that is, what we imagine “culture” and “society” as systems to be. More concretely, I suggest that Skinner’s early efforts to accommodate the vast temporal horizon and unparalleled complexity of “China” as analytical object constitute a important object lesson with respect to contemporary academic discourses on topics like “globalization” and historical change.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540466672062,8.1,2010,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Dreaming Ethnicity in the Politics of Recognition,Ya-Chung Chuang,"ethnicity, politics of recognition, multiculturalism, Pangcah, Hakka","This article investigates a new minority politics in which ethnicity is metaphored into a multiplicity of expression and democracy is seen as a space for creatively unorthodox imaginations and appeals. The creation of ethnicity as imagined alterity moves democracy into the phase of what Charles Taylor calls the “politics of recognition.” This article documents two ethnic recognition struggles in Taiwan. One is about an aboriginal Pangcah tribe whose tribalism had uncovered a longburied memory and whose exposure would have been explosively disconcerting. The other one is about what I would call a Hakka radicalism whose recent formation showed the heterogeneity of a Han Chinese identity. I find in both cases an ethnic “dream” in which the recognition of long-lost cultural values was a creation in the face of a past in the shadows. Recognition was a process of daily reinvented acknowledgements of a shadowed tradition under the effects of unrecognizable cultural confrontations. There are always unthought, unspoken, and unexperienced forces out there that need to be dealt with in this politics of recognition.

From Tribal Society to Nationalized Ethnic Group: Imagination and Performance of Identity in qataban (headhunting ritual/harvest festival) Among the Kavalan,Pi-chen Liu,"ethnic identity, nationalization, headhunting ritual, harvest festival, Kavalan","This paper will examine how “traditional rituals” were once models for reflecting on, organizing and managing daily life, from the native’s point of view. Through rituals, people built an imagined link with the natural and supernatural world, forming a tribal society that was autonomous and in which resources were shared. Under the impact of external influences, traditional rituals gradually became innovated and imagined constructs with contemporary political objectives, the process involving group classification and integration of new social relationship into the changing state. Taking the Kavalan people as an example, who were successfully recognized as an ethnic group by the government in 2002. As a case study, this paper will analyze how, after martial law was lifted in Taiwan in 1987, against the background of political liberalization and reconstruction of national identity, the people of Sinshe village in Hualien County used various innovative qataban activities (transforming it from the headhunting ritual into the harvest festival) as a reflexive strategy for the group’s name restoration movement to avoid a direct conflict with national assimilation politics. Through the dramatic effects and symbolism of the contemporary performance of the qataban, they echoed, opposed and imagined the “we group” and then created new social relationships in the process of negotiating differences and conflict between internal sub-groups. At the same time, through the interactive participation of government, media and academia, this nationalized ethnic group, severed from tradition, was imagined and the group’s “existence” was announced to, and negotiated with, the government.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540520450240,8.2,2010,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
When the Cultural Model of Success Fails: Mainland Chinese Teenage Immigrants in Hong Kong,Wai-chi Chee,"China, teenagers, migration, education, cultural model","This paper argues that when teenage immigrants from mainland China come to Hong Kong to join mainstream secondary education, they are expected to perform according to a cultural model of success—that is, by immigrating to Hong Kong and getting a “good education,” they believe they are guaranteed future economic success. The migration decision is mainly made by parents, but the success is expected to be achieved by the children. This research looks into how these teenagers internalize this cultural model and what happens when it fails them. The gap between model and reality does not seem to shake their belief.

The Hall of the Wondrous Dharma began as a small spirit-writing group in the 1940s,and evolved into a local geomancy historical event in the 1950s, moving into a high peak in 1960s, and declining after the 1980s. Using Bryan Wilson’s sociological typology of sects, I try to shed light on Chinese spirit-writing halls. The thaumaturgical, manipulationist, and reformist types of action in Wilson’s typology are especially relevant to my analysis. I characterize the spirit-writing hall as a way that thaumaturgical action begins to move toward the manipulationist and reformist types of action in Chinese popular religious contexts. Finally, I offer a dual plausibility model to explain how different spirit-writing halls build their plausibility from folk religion’s. The dual plausibility model of corresponding plausibility and discrepancy plausibility can help us to understand the developmental trajectory of the spirit-writing hall in the Chinese cultural and social complex.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540531357100,8.3,2010,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
A Study of Basic Color Terms in Northern Tsou: An Application of Berlin & Kay’s eory,"Avayi. Yoifoana, Ben-ray Jai","basic colorterms, focal color, Northern Tsou, LinguisticAnthropology","Berlin & Kay’s theory of color-cognition asserts that as languages evolve, they acquire a total of 11 basic color terms in 6 strictly predictable chronological stages. The sequence confined by the structure of universal semantics is outlined in Basic Color Terms (1969). Scholars have debated Berlin & Kay’s proposition quite a lot during the last 40 years. The authors of this paper follow the linguistic anthropological approach to survey the Northern Tsou’s basic color terms in practice through six research aspects：1) basic color terms (by means of Berlin and Kay’s definition), 2) evolutionary stages of basic color terms, 3) focal colors in daily life color-cognition, 4) social significances of color terms usages, 5) analysis of all color terms in the oral literatures, and 6) the expressions of color terms in the everyday life world from past to presentday. All findings in summary are as follows： 1) There are 5 basic color terms in Northern Tsou (in the 4th stage). 2) The focal colors, BLACK and WHITE, are just the same as their counterparts in almost all other languages in the world, however, the foci of the other 3 basic color terms, i.e. RED, YELLOW and GREEN, are a little bit different from contemporary English counterparts. 3) There exists a paradigm-shift among different generations in terms of color cognition, in that the younger generation accepts western standards and the elder generations show a mixture of both traditional and modern ones.cognitive attitudes. 4) The “Male/RED & BLACK” and “Female/GRUE & BLACK” distinctions are the essential principles of costume systems in all different occasions of the northern Tsou society. 5) The color expression has been influenced by Christian churches since a few decades ago, but recently has begun to change back.

The Representation and Invention of Culture: The Process and Challenge of the Sakizaya Ethnic Reconstruction,Ling–ling Chin,"Sakizaya, culture, ethnic identification","The Sakizaya, regarded as subgroup of the Amis in the past, applied for ethnic recertification successfully in 2007. By historical investigation, representing the ritual and cultural tradition, the elites acknowledged their new identities. But gaps between the ethnic definition and knowledge of legends exist between the elite promoters of the new identity and the masses. There are no distinctive Sakizaya features that define the tribe, because the Sakizaya were subordinated to the Amis tribe for more than one hundred years, and most rituals and customs were assimilated by the Amis. Some contradictions and conflicts among the Sakizaya elites could not be reconciled before recertification. They attempted to construct exclusive discourses by restating and representing the tradition as well as creating artificial criteria to categorize the new ethnicity. Until now only five hundred Sakizaya have officially converted their ethnic registration. It is controversial that elites’ enthusiasm couldn’t move their tribal people who had assimilated to be Amis. This paper will explore the process of ethnic and cultural construction of a newly ethnic recertified group. How do the promoters face the objections and questions from the others and insiders? How do they shape a cultural image under the still weak identification?

Bodily Memory and Sensibility: Culinary Preferences and National Consciousness in the Case of “Taiwanese Cuisine”,Yu–jen Chen,"bodily memory, sensibility, Taiwanese cuisine, culinary preference, national consciousness","This paper employs “bodily memory” to theorize the concept culinary preference and examines how consumers conceive of the notion of a “Taiwanese cuisine” and the relationship between national consciousness and culinary preference. I will consider how a sense of nationality might link individuals to a particular set of dishes. The cases discussed reveal that “Taiwanese cuisine” is not meaningful to all consumers, and a preference for that cuisine cannot be interpreted as purely an expression of Taiwanese identity. Instead, such a preference is rooted in the lived experience and bodily memories of consumers. This study shows that informants understand “Taiwanese cuisine” from diverse perspectives, in particular gender, locality, and ethnicity. Social positions, the social experiences of consumers, and their need for inclusion and exclusion are all influential in shaping these diverse perspectives. On the basis of their lived experiences and memories (of specific flavors and dining contexts, for instance), individuals develop their own sensibilities, which serve as the ground where culinary preference and national consciousness appear to be correlated. Thus, while food is often viewed as a boundary marker in anthropological research, this research identifies restrictions on the boundary-marker roles that food can play.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540531357100,8.3,2010,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Commemorating the Ancestors’ Merit: Myth, Schema, and History in the “Charter of Emperor Ping”",Eli Noah Alberts,"Yao people, Iu Mien, King Pan, Yao charters, cultural schema","This paper focuses on a genre of text that has circulated in certain Yao communities in South China, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. It is known by a variety of names, but most commonly as the “Charter of Emperor Ping” (pinghuang quandie 評皇券牒) and the “Passport for Crossing the Mountains” (guoshanbang 過山榜). The Charter is usually in the form of a scroll, decorated with imperial chops, talismans, illustrations of emperors and Daoist deities, maps, and other images. Because of its resemblance to documents written by Chinese officialdom, the prevalence of imperial symbolism and linguistic usage, and the specific claims about Yao identity embedded in it, most past scholars have taken it to be an imperial edict once issued to Yao leaders, granting them autonomy in the mountainous spaces of the empire. In this paper, I view it instead as an indigenous production, one originally created by local Yao leaders who were familiar with imperial textualizing practices, who manipulated them to serve their own ends and the needs of their people and family members. From the Qing dynasty up through the first half of the twentieth century, Yao people, primarily Iu Mien or Pan Yao 盤瑤 from Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, circulated the Charter and similar documents, made copies, and preserved them for their posterity. The question is, to what end. Finally, I analyze the ordering schema of the entire tradition of charter production in Yao communities and demonstrate how the narrative and visual features work in synergy to commemorate the merit of Yao ancestors, mythical and historical, which forms the basis of Yao (Mien) claims about their position in the state and the cosmos.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540560723255,9.1,2011,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

We argue that historians and cultural theorists have perhaps underestimated the manner in which the stipulated character of indigenous peoples on the edge of empire could be engineered to further the cause of such empire. In this case two observers, one Japanese the other British, both more or less in the guise of anthropologists, brought their foreign gaze to the interactive frontier of Han civilization and indigenous life in early 20th century Taiwan. In London, at the heart of the Western imperial enterprise, both used their observations to undermine any claims of the Chinese to legitimate rule over the indigenous east of Taiwan. Both, but in quite different ways, saw the treatment of aboriginal groups as a test case for Japanese colonialism— the one as an ameliorative process, the other as an example of Darwinian competition for resources among unequal ethnologies.

Currently, how to reconstruct the indigenous traditional food system and its connections to ecology and economy has become an important issue. This paper examines changes in the traditional food system and it’s reconstruction from a historical perspective, through the case study of the indigenous Fata’an community in eastern Taiwan. The study finds that there are two forces for change affecting Fata’an’s traditional food system —one is the progress of modernization as a project of colonization, the other is capitalist infiltration along with modernization.

On the Ownership and Authority of Local Knowledge: e Reflections of Interpretive Anthropology on Lahuy’s “esis Defense at Home,Hsuta Lin,"local knowledge, interpretive anthropology, reflexive ethnography, authority, thick description","Drawing on Geertzian interpretive anthropology, this article elaborates how ethnographies reflect the fieldwork discipline, represent the native’s point of view and further reshape the understanding of local knowledge. Conventional ethnographic writing often displays a research dilemma, in that the anthropologist experiences his involvement as an observer of cultural activities and yet disappears from his own textual presentation. The arrival on the scene of interpretive anthropology in the 1960s and ‘70s inspired the paradigm of ethnographic writing, in which rhetorical concerns – the ownership and authority of local knowledge, and self-reflection on fieldwork and ethnographic writing – were transformed into a cumulative, multifaceted representation of anthropological studies. Ethnographers came to doubt the legitimacy of fieldwork while the realization of intersubjectivity between anthropologists and their informants became a major concern. This essay suggests that the emergent task of current anthropology is to understand the meaning of the disguise and transfiguration of local knowledge, through which “thick description” was launched as an intellectual method for eliciting cultural derivations from tribal sentiments, concealed norms, obscure portrayals, or ambiguous identities.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540560723255,9.1,2011,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
From Ancestor-Spirits-Ritual to Mgay Bari: e Construction and Interpretation of Contemporary ‘Traditional’ Ritual among the Truku,Yun-Fang Chiu,"Truku, ancestor-spirits-ritual, “traditional” ritual, cultural construction, Name Rectification Campaign","This article, based on past studies of contemporary Truku ‘traditional’ rituals and written materials of the ‘Mgay Bari’ ritual from 2007 to 2009, investigates the construction and interpretation by Truku elites of contemporary ‘traditional’ ritual. Past research regarding aboriginal ‘traditional’ rituals in contemporary Taiwan were mostly analyzed within the contexts of tourism or name rectification campaigns. Due to their focus on the present, these studies often saw the construction of ‘traditional’ rituals as short-term manipulations generated to meet the needs of tourism or name rectification. Unlike the above viewpoints, this study is not confined to the contemporary context. Instead the author attempts to analyze through a long-term historical perspective, including the Truku’s migrating from Natou to the east, expanding their territory, interacting with other eastern ethnic groups, living under Japanese colonial rule, and campaigning for Truku Name Rectification. Through analysis of these historical processes, this article aims to clarify the entanglements between the construction of ‘traditional’ ritual and Truku Name Rectification Campaign, and to explore the social-cultural dynamics behind contemporary Truku ‘traditional’ rituals.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540571165311,9.2,2011,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Cultural Self-Consciousness and the Reconstruction of Tradition among the Bunun of Taiwan,Shu-yuan Yang,"the Bunun, malahtangia ritual, reconstruction of tradition, cultural tourism, politics of tradition","This article aims to understand the meanings and impact of the reconstruction of tradition and the objectification of culture among the Bunun, an Austronesian-speaking indigenous people of Taiwan. It situates the revival of tradition in the contexts of state appropriation and the development of ethnic tourism, and shows how the Bunun attempt to negotiate their relationship with the state and the dominant society by reconstituting tradition in the present. From in-depth analysis of the Bunun’s signature ritual, malahtangia, we can see that continuity with the past lies not in the exact reproduction of the symbolic meanings of ritual, but in the culturally specific ways in which the Bunun sustain local identity and sociality by reproducing their concept of personhood. A comparison of tradition’s different political effects in several Bunun settlements shows that the revival of tradition can be a means of empowerment, but the politicization of culture also has the potential to draw the Bunun into the bureaucratized discourse of tradition which would result in their greater dependence on the state and a commodity logic that can further marginalize them. As the Bunun in different areas attempt to deploy culture as a conscious value and construct tradition as a product of their historically situated action, we can expect that Bunun tradition will become more diversified in the future.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540571165311,9.2,2011,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
The Eternal Return of Disaster: A Study of Politics of Memory and the Repeat of Disaster,Shaw-wu Jung,"memory, anthropology of disaster, the 921 earthquake, public discourse","This article studies why similar patterns of coping with disasters are repeated in Taiwan. To explore the issue, I take two cases in Nangang Village, Guoxing Township. The first case I examine is Jiufener Mountain National Earthquake Memorial Park, located at the epicenter of the 9/21 earthquake in the village. The state and the professional design teams put in place tremendous manpower and money to build the Park in a way that appears to inscribe onto the landscape the state’s grand narrative of the earthquake, which from the beginning aimed to convert local memories of suffering into an official memory. The second case is the “Deer Deity Festival”, also held in the village after the earthquake. The Festival is distinguished from the Park, a fixed, routine, official, and inscriptive memorialization, by its dynamic, particular, local, and performative character, to use Connerton’s famous categorizations (1989). Through analysis of the two cases, I want to show that when a disaster strikes, discourses are easily transformed into official memory without the critical construction of social communication. When there is no learning and communication, a society may not act to change, and the patterns of coping with disaster are doomed to repeat.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540571165311,9.2,2011,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Portnoy, Awi Mona","international law, regulatory regime, environmental sustainability, indigenous peoples, worldview","International organizations and national governments have developed environmental management values that differ from and often conflict with pre-existing local community-environment relations. Because central government legislation dominates current land and natural resource policies, the interests of local and indigenous peoples are often sacrificed. Due to the complexity of pluralistic international-national and indigenous legal systems, an overview of international environmental legal discourse may furnish a useful conceptual framework. This paper seeks to empower the constructive formation of customary institutions and environmental worldviews for Taiwanese indigenous Rukai people by conducting a comparative study of the institutions of international, national, and local environmental regulatory regimes.

"Disaster, Relocation and Vulnerability: The Case Study of Kucapungane",Sasala Taiban,"disaster, relocation, Morakot, vulnerability, Rinari","After the 2009 Typhoon Morakot, the Taiwanese government relocated three indigenous villages, Dashe, Majia, and Haocha, to an area of about 30 hectares. At present, now christened Rinari and with a total population approximately 1500, this area is the most populous indigenous community in Taiwan. Using the Rinari community’s Haocha Village (Kucapungane) as a case study, this paper examines conflict and social vulnerability as they are brought about by relocation. In Kucapungane’s case, this is not the first time in recorded history that the village has been relocated, and many reconstruction policies appear to be constructed around the same notions as the earlier relocation: the government continues to believe that simply providing indigenous disaster victims with a safe place of residence will do. This study investigates the significance of space to the community, using internal viewpoints to discuss post-disaster government actions regarding resettlement, relocation, and other issues of political significance. Why did the state, which attempted to protect indigenous peoples, promote the continuation of cultural traditions, tribal integrity, and sustainable development through relocation and provision of permanent housing, not only fail to get the support of tribesmen, but also recieved criticism and backlash from the community? When disaster strikes, how can the residents of a community reorganize and mobilize? In what ways does disaster reconstruction play a role in restoring their lives, and what effect does it have on culture? In fact, due to populations residing in different ecological and social environments, they adapt differently to natural disasters and strain. Therefore, in disaster research, if one does not start from within the study population to understand the practical implications of the disaster in a specific cultural context, and if one is unable to separate oneself from subjective social and cultural contexts, one’s analysis will deviate from the facts and will not help understand the root causes of the disaster. As for the long-standing interdependent relationship between indigenous people and the land, it includes a community’s life experiences, material culture and collective memory. Once indigenous people are removed from their ancestral living space and traditional territory, their livelihoods as well as interpersonal relationships are difficult to maintain. History has proved that relocation not only affects space, productivity and social structure, it also has effects on cultural preservation. Political compromise shaped Rinari, just as the geography of the administrative enclave includes both cultural heterogeneity and the ability of the community to live together in conflict as recorded in history. Miscellaneous factors may lead to both ethnic cooperation as well as continued conflict in the future. Rinari’s crowded living space, and an obvious shortage of arable land, are sufficient to cause new problems and difficulties in industrial development. The future, if one considers the difference and particularity of the individual ethnic groups in language, culture and lifestyle, and uses a generalized mode of thinking to simplify complex ethnic issues, most likely holds another disaster, this time of another sort.. In postdisaster reconstruction it is not just ""housing"" that must be settled, or the construction of public facilities. The reconstruction process must also factor in the consideration of the people’s mentality, health, culture and society. Our research suggests that relocation methods should be reviewed and due consideration be given to land, culture, education, and economic livelihood issues in newly established areas. Policies that determine fundamental considerations and make use of detailed assessments to carry out practices may minimize the negative impacts of relocation and resettlement on indigenous cultural survival, and form a base for cultural development.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540603520016,10.1,2012,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Locality at Large: Time, Space, and Inter-Village Networks in Tainan’s Saikang Koah-hiu Procession",Jen-chieh Ting,"folk religion, locality, Saikang Koah-hiu, authentification, royal lords","What is the relationship between locality and globalization? Can locales resist the flow of capital? By using the concept “locality at large”, this paper tries to examine these issues empirically, and tries to shed light on the “very big” inter-village communal festivals within the Han Chinese folk religion within the modern global arena. Under the nationalist situation and global economy, people tend to think more about the security of their particular place in the world. Places then are the “contested terrain of competing definitions”. Nevertheless, to discuss the contemporary place, we still need to look back at our traditional place. This paper tries to explore the issue of traditional place through a new lens. The Saikang Koah-hiu procession in Southern Taiwan is a very large local festival which involves more than ninety palanquins and troupes. It originated from the terror of floods and plagues in the Tsengwen river area, thus a large inter-village communal ritual cooperation began to emerge. Even the change of regional land measurements and boundary disputes haven’t disrupted this cooperation. Furthermore, historically, the function of conferring a newly emerging village’s authenticity through building up a “large communal locality” has become crucially important. Once every three years, the Saikang Koah-hiu takes place within a large festival combining several other rituals, including a Daoist “Lord offering” ritual, a ceremony that emulates etiquette within imperial yamens (higher level government offices), a Boat-burning ritual, and a three-day inter-communitarian territorial procession. During the period of about one week, it is believed that the Jade Emperor sends three of the Gods of Pestilence (among twelve) to Saikang to control pestilence and recover social justice. This festival has continued to be held in this area for more than 200 years. We offer a model, “Ecology of Authentification”, which can explain how a village accomplishes its village production and reproduction through not only political and economic institutions, but also through “traditional institutions”. This model of “Ecology of Authentification” explains how, under each specific natural and social ecology, a village can attain authenticity through a process of ritual confirmation and public demonstration. The mechanism of the “large locality’s ” conferring function is the special yet typical lesson we learn from the Saikang case. In particular, we offer several parallel concepts to substantiate our analyses: authentification of magic power vs. authentification of the reciprocal side, and master authentification vs. subauthentification. When this “large locality” enters into the modern national state, there are a lot of confrontations and negotiations. This “large locality”, with its original function of conferring authentification, now plays the role of static and dynamic cultural heritage for the nation-state, and also the possible role of accumulating capital for global capitalists. Within these interstices, the formerly very marginal agricultural region Saikang, re-enters as a nexus between the core and the periphery. Finally, we make a comparison between locality, large locality and pilgrimage center, and discuss of how traditional ways of reproducing locality can be relevant to modern nationalist institutions and the global economic system.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540603520016,10.1,2012,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Gallin,"Feminism, Neo-Marxism, Global Capitalist Patriarchy, reflexivity, oppositional discourse, resistance","The author introduces three major paradigm shifts in theories of women and development in Taiwan over the past 50 years when she was involved in research in Hsin Hsing, a rural community in west-central Taiwan. This paper explores the way theory has been engraved in her work by adopting an epistemological and reflexive stance. On the one hand, based on nuanced ethnographic data, the author explicates how different epistemological stances provided her the lenses with which she presented the “reality” of women during different stage of her research. On the other hand, a reflexive stance compelled the author to confront her own processes of thinking. The epistemological choices led her to produce a number of different “truths”, but the reflexivity challenged her to admit that. In sum, the author argues that while her descriptions of Hsin Hsing women’s lives mirrored reality, her interpretation of the meanings attributed to them were profoundly shaped by the theory that guided her thinking",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=530205540603520016,10.1,2012,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
The Missionary Gaze: The Social Biography and Archiving of Dr. David Landsborough IV’s Photographic Collections,Harry Yi-Jui Wu,"photo elicitation, social biography, social archive, missionary medicine, material culture","This research showcases the ‘social biography’ and significance of missionary photographs and the archives in which these images were deposited. I explore the internal and external narratives of the photographas-artifact, which was generated within the practice of missionary medicine from the end of the nineteenth century to the early period after the Second World War. In particular I examine the photo collection of Dr. David Landsborough IV （1914-2009, also known as 蘭大弼）, with reference to other visual records produced by medical missionaries and other historical accounts. Drawing upon theories of historical anthropology and engaging the collector by the method of photo elicitation, I show how photographs present researchers with a new window on missionary medicine, one alternative to those of imperial or colonial history. Landsborough’s collection reveals the mixed and hybrid material culture of British and Japanese colonialisms and the local folk of Taiwan. It also shows the transformation and localization of missionaries’ identities over time. By showcasing the story “A Skin-Graft with Love,” this paper analyses the process by which a paradigm of missionary medicine was illustrated and projected through photography and other graphic forms. It also attests to the necessity of such projection in the contested medical marketplace of multiple colonial cultures. In addition, by tracing the career history of the Landsboroughs from natural historians to medical missionaries, this paper suggests that photography can be seen not only as a method of documentation, but also as a way to represent cultural and ritual life in the social networking of certain intellectual communities. Lastly, this paper discusses the problems researchers might encounter, including ethical and cultural repatriation issues, when using photographs as resources for historical enquiry.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=562033511753431011,10.2,2012,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
From Dream and Myth to Ritual Performance: Self-Image and the Formation of Symbolism Among the Guizhou Kam in China,Shu-jung Lin,"dream, myth, ritual performance, psychoanalysis, the Kam","There has long been debate among cross-cultural researchers on whether Freudian dream interpretation is applicable to non-Western societies. Psychoanalysts and anthropologists alike stress the significance of dream interpretation and meaning when dealing with myth and ritual action discourses, both of which can be addressed as examples of acting out, and both of which are viewed as vividly revealing symbols of cultures, especially the subjectivity of the collective self. In this paper I use Lacanian psychoanalytical perspective (esp. language and symbolism) to examine how the Kam people of Guizhou, China interpret dreams, myths, and ritual performances for purposes of understanding their senses of self/ personhood and cultural symbols. The Kam have traditionally practiced patrilineal cross-cousin marriage, which requires two generations of wife-takers and wife-givers to complete a marriage exchange cycle. When dealing with issues of the self and personhood in anthropology, sociality is central to any analysis of the relationship between wife-takers and wife-givers. Whereas psychoanalysts would likely emphasize the aspect of inner self when analyzing this practice, anthropologists are more likely to focus on the external mechanism for establishing self/personhood from such embedded contexts as events, social activities (actions and behaviors) and language (speech and discourse) to locate the position of a subject. In other words, ways that the self and personhood are constituted, either individually or collectively, are embedded in social life. There are various mechanisms (e.g. myths, taboos, social exchange and ritual performance) in Kam society to inform men and women that they have to learn and to practice an appropriate form of self/personhood. For example, wei33 keh55 is an social exchange between two villages which can be understood as a reflection and an act of performance the completion of marriage transaction between two social groups. First, I describe a dream account told by a Kam woman which foretold an occurrence of death in the village. A dream is not only a social reality but also carries the cultural message to inform Kam men and women to enter marriage exchange practice. Then, I move to the Kam songs performed by Kam men and women during social exchange activities. Through the lyrics and symbols contained in the Kam songs, men and women express their loves, emotions and desires towards their desirable marriage partners. Although Kam song singing is an institutional mechanism, individual men and women are able to convey their internationality[1] by selecting suitable songs to express their personal desires and situations. Third, I discuss how taboo observations constitute the Kam self, one is aimed at pregnant women (birth) and the other towards the surviving family of a dead person. It is through the taboo practices that the Kam people complete their transformation of sociality: from birth to death or from death to social reproduction. In addition, I examine Kam myths and their practices of sa323 goddess [the goddess of a Kam female ancestor] worship to further my discussion of the significance of marriage exchange. In the myths and ritual performance to honor sa323goddess, 12 male representatives of Kam clans enter the sa323 goddess shrine to worship sa323 and then to engage in drinking and eating which I regard as an imitation of marriage exchange or social reproduction. Finally, I describe the content of ritual action performed by the Kam people whenever a disharmonious event occurs in the family or in the village. Pa55 kou323, which refers to empty words, is the ritual practiced constantly by the Kam people to prevent ""being gossiped or being talked about"" by other people, including either the living or the deceased. Although ritual practice such as pa55 kou323 is an external action, however, it is effective in the constitution of the Kam self by reminding people not to engage with actions of ""empty words"" or ""being gossiped about."" That is, the ritual of pa55 kou323 is not only a symbolic action but also serves as a regulatory mechanism to constitute the Kam self. My conclusions are (a) dream accounts and cultural interpretations of dreams foretell Kam social realities, (b) myths as story-form of living reality legitimate ritual action and verify the effectiveness of social practices, and (c) rituals as fictions and imitations of social reality serve as imaginary social ideals for Kam cultural ideology. Dreams, myths and rituals all contain some characteristics of fantasy and imagination but are all able to express, articulate and verify what social realities are in their own ways. Symbols are the basic mechanisms which have the capacities to connect fantasy and imagination with social realities. In sum, dreams, myths and rituals provide the inner, subjective and the imaginary of social realities, and its significance is no less than that of the external, objective and practical aspect of social realities. For human society to move on from generation to generation, it needs both operating mechanisms: the imaginary and the practical.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=562033511753431011,10.2,2012,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
A Lens into Culture and History: A Chinese Peasant Woman Hu Xinkui’s Life Narrative,Fei-wen Liu,"life narrative, oral history, women, China, cultural change","Using a Chinese peasant woman, Hu Xinkui’s 呼新奎, as a looking lens, this article unfolds the socio-cultural change of rural China in the transitional period from around Liberation in 1949 up to 1978, and even into the twenty-first century, covering a wide range of issues regarding footbinding, child brides, forced conscription, bridal lamentation, communist collectivization, and a series of political movements such as land reform, the Great Leap Forward, the Socialist Education Movement, the Four Clearing-ups Movement, and the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Association. Hu Xinkui, born in 1934 in Jiangyong County of Hunan Province in south China, was a child bride who was promoted as a director of Women’s Affairs after Liberation because of her suppressed inferior status. It was also because of the Liberation-implemented new marriage law that laid the foundation for her husband to divorce her in 1959, for the reason of her apparent infertility and lack of romance, as well as her concern for an unmarried brother, which preoccupied her to the detriment of her own marriage. She remarried in 1964 and retired from her active political life after she had children, since then she has committed herself to being an extremely hard-working housewife. With her husband being an active and honest party cadre (including being the deputy to the 9th Party Congress in 1969), she had to find every possible source to maintain the family finance in order to receive a great deal of visiting guests and peasants, at a cost of neglecting the education of her children, two of whom were addicted to gambling. Her life story manifests how an ordinary village woman engaged with local women’s expressive traditions, called 女書 (women’s script) and 女歌 (women’s song), and how her personal life changed along with the transformation of China. Also worth noting, the life history interviews with Xinkui were conducted in the company of her daughter and son-in-law, who have assisted my nüshu research for more than a decade – and they had never learned about Hu Xinkui’s past until then. Their participation throws additional reflective light on Xinkui’s life experiences in China’s changing rural context. With Hu Xinkui’s life history as the axis, this article aims to draw attention to the life narrative approach as a tool for collecting ethnographic data and to bring about a rethinking of its use as a conceptual framework. Recognizing the possible limitations of life narrative in terms of its partiality, lapses, mistakes, and exaggeration, I employ narratives from multiple subjects and diverse resources (e.g., literary composition, local oral traditions, and historical documents) to open up the dialogical horizon of a life narration. I demonstrate that life history as a lived experience and an account of life not only speaks to a person’s lifeworld, it is also an intertextualization of the voices of multiple subject-positions: narrating subject, addressee, researcher, and the embedded context. In the case of Hu Xinkui, her life narration not only encodes her history and historiography, but also manifests how the next generation, especially her daughter, decodes her story and writes it onto their own. Life narrative in this sense is a convergence of history and culture, whereby history continues and culture persists.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=562033511753431011,10.2,2012,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Repaying a Nuo Vow in Western Hunan: A Rite of Trans-Hybridity?,Paul R. Katz,"Repaying a Nuo Vow, Western Hunan, Miao, trans-hybridity, ritual specialists","This paper explores the significance of a set of Han Chinese rituals and dramas known as “Repaying a Nuo Vow” (Huan Nuoyuan 還儺願), based on the study of their performance among the Miao (苗) of Western Hunan (Xiangxi 湘西). I examine the cultural significance of the Repaying a Nuo Vow rituals from three perspectives: 1) a case study of one such rites held at Hulu (葫蘆) Village in Huayuan (花垣) County on November 15- 16, 2011, 2) additional data that other scholars have collected about these rites throughout Western Hunan, including among both Miao and Tujia 土家 communities, 3) historical and ethnographic information on such rituals performed in other parts of Southwest China. The overall goal of this paper is to examine the development of and recurring interaction between Han Chinese and non-Han ritual traditions, as opposed to focusing exclusively on one community and its religious life. In doing so, I have attempted to to distinguish between deep-rooted indigenous rites and the absorption of Daoist ritual elements introduced to Western Hunan by Han Chinese ritual specialists. This paper will show that in areas settled earlier and in great density by Han migrants, the rituals and dramas performed during Repaying a Nuo Vow retained many of their original features, including numerous liturgical texts written in Chinese that survive to the present day. In areas settled later and less extensively (including Huayuan), Repaying a Nuo Vow blended features of both Miao and Han religious traditions. Vow-making and vow-repaying rituals are particularly well-suited for the study of cross-cultural interaction. This is because repaying a vow made to the gods constitutes a basic element in many religious cultures worldwide, including in China, with a central theme of Chinese religious life being repayment or retribution. If one relies on a chronological approach based on existing sources, one can uncover a long and complex record of Chinese terms for rituals referred as “vows” (or “oaths”) (including yuan 願, shi 誓, meng 盟, etc.). Rituals featuring the making and then repaying of vows to the gods encompass the entire spectrum of Chinese religious history, dating back to the ancient “spring prayer and autumn repayment” (chunqi qiubao 春祈秋報) rites for the god of the soil. They have played integral roles in the development of Chinese Buddhism and Daoism, and continue to flourish among Chinese communities today, including in Taiwan. Vow-making and vow-repaying rituals have long been widespread among the Western Hunan Miao as well, where they include ancestor worship rites and the renowned oxen sacrifice. In the case of the Repaying a Nuo Vow rituals and dramas, the data reveal that their development was characterized not only by the deliberate transmission of doctrine and liturgy, but also by their gradual absorption of indigenous beliefs and practices. To do justice to these complex forms of cultural reverberation and their impact on Repaying a Nuo Vow, I have chosen to combine the two key mechanisms at work into a shorthand, “transhybridity,” which will be used throughout the paper.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=564764772137575423,11.2,2013,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Changing Kinship Ethics for Personhood and Relatedness in a “House Society”: The Hill-Dwelling Zaiwa of Late Twentieth Century China,Ts’ui-p’ing Ho,"Louis Dumont, holism, cultural change, the Zaiwa, Chinese state effect","The Post-Dumontian discussion of hierarchy highlights the relationship between Dumont’s epistemological position on the comparative study of culture against his views on holism and the concept of an encompassing hierarchy of value. The Post-Dumontains argue that Dumont’s fluid and open approach to social boundaries in holisms is especially well suited for understanding historical changes that arise from colonial contact and Christian conversion. The aim of this essay is to consider Dumont and the Post-Dumontian discussion in light of the changing kinship ethics for personhood and relatedness within the hilldwelling Zaiwa house society during the last decades of twentieth century based on fieldwork conducted between 1988 and 2000 in Zaiwa villages in Luxi and Longchuan counties, Dehong Prefecture. With the “opening” policies that were put into practice in China in the 1980s, the cultural practices of the hill-dwelling Zaiwa in Luxi and Longchuan became more heterogeneous as practice, experience, and choice. Surface appearances notwithstanding, state influence over people’s everyday lives did not disappear during this era. However, Zaiwa did negotiate with the state over “value” versus “power.” On the one hand, they were experiencing a sense of social detachment due to a loss of kinship as a value that de-totalized their cultural hierarchy of personhood. On the other hand, Zaiwa strategically chose particular rituals or celebrative activities whose intention was to re-encompass and re-totalize kinship as a value. The changes for the hill-dwelling Zaiwa describe a complicated process of negotiation under the state’s gaze that differs from extant descriptions of change in the context of Christian conversion elsewhere in the world.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=564764772137575423,11.2,2013,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Contesting “Institute Nanny Motherhood”: The Emotional Labor of Childcare Workers in a Contemporary Chinese State-run Orphanage,Linliang Qian,"Chinese Orphanage, Institute Nanny, Motherhood, Emotional Labor, Mothering Experience","In the domestic media and official reports, Chinese institute nannies are always being portrayed as “loving nanny mothers” who selflessly devote all their love and care to the institutionalized children. In contrast, some Western media and human rights organizations denounce them as demoralized and inhumane caregivers who neglect and abuse institutionalized children. As these two extremist representations dominate Chinese and Western public discourses, the actual working experience, everyday life and emotions of Chinese institute nannies are largely ignored. What are their relationships with institutionalized children really like? How do these relationships affect their own life experiences? And how do these relationships affect the lives of institutionalized children? This article attempts to answer these questions. Based on my six-month fieldwork in a child welfare institute in southeast China, I argue that, like other jobs in the service sector, institute nannies’ emotional labor constrains, but also produces emotions, of and on the nannies’ bodies. These emotions include their attachment to many institutionalized children for whom they care, their serious attitude toward the children who have done wrong, their ambivalence in doing this job, and even their identification with the distinctive “institute nanny motherhood”. While this empirically-grounded new type of “motherhood” extends the existing academic research on motherhood studies by breaking up the traditionally assumed spatial and occupational differentiations, and illustrating a unique working experience of “mothering as a paid job in the workplace”, the process of institute nannies’ emotional labor adds a dynamic dimension to Arlie Hochschild’s notion of “emotional labor,” and also corrects its bias, which sees the work of emotional labor only as a false performance, by taking the self-identity of workers to justify the authenticity of their emotional expressions in the workplace. This ethnographic study first examines the institute nannies’ working conditions in my field site. It shows that the job of institute nanny is highly gendered and socially stratified in local society. These female caregivers with rural backgrounds suffer from low salary, overloaded work, delayed overtime payment as well as no public holiday or medical leave, but they are required by their work unit, the Chinese government and the public to devote themselves to childcare work by “mothering the foundlings as their own children”. Facing such high expectations along with poor working conditions, the institute nannies become ambivalent. Refusing to be socialist model workers who have to be self-sacrificing, they complain and negotiate with the welfare institute leaders to protect their own interests, but at the same still gradually develop their attachment to the institutionalized children for whom they care through intensive childrearing practices. I provide a detailed description of the physical and emotional nurturing processes, through which the deep emotional bond between the nannies and children is built, and furthermore, the self-identity of “institute nanny mother” based on their own definition is constructed. Still, in the course of nurturing these children, frequently intervened in by the welfare institute and the volunteers, and considering their own interests, the nannies often feel contradictory, especially regarding the issue of disciplining children. Whether or not to discipline children, when to do it, and what the rationality behind disciplinary actions is, all become problems they have to deal with. Furthermore, the intimacy between the nannies and the institutionalized children will eventually be cut off by adoptions or other kinds of separations, because the welfare institute and the public all assume that a “normal” family will provide the children with more love and care, and therefore is a better choice for them. This causes the nannies serious emotional exhaustion. Later sections of this ethnographic study offer moving stories about how the nannies deal with the emotional challenges of working as “institute nanny mothers.” These stories not only demonstrate the contesting experiences of these childcare workers, but also reveal the production and running of emotion and identity in a specific institution.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=564764772137575423,11.2,2013,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Chu Salt Trade Diaspora in the Eastern Zhou Period,Po-chan Chen,"Eastern Zhou, Chu, Ba, trade diaspora, migration","In recent years, archaeological research of migration not only gradually change from large-scale to small-scale population movements, but also search for more detailed exploration of migration purposes and impacts on contemporary societies. Among these research issues, diasporic group is one of important research topics. In this artcile, I start from exploring the concept of diasporic groups in social science and then discuss its influences and applications on current archaeological research of people movement, especially research of trade diaspora. In the end, I take Eastern Zhou period Chu-style cemetery in the eastern bank of Ganjinggou River mouth in the Three Gorges as an example to argue that the burial owners in this cemetery are trade diasporic merchants for salt trades from the Chu State to the Ba State. This argument is different from previous research which treats these burial owners as Chu military troops for looting salt from the Ba State.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=620157437256413167,12.1,2014,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
The Formation of Religious Experiences and its Ideology: The Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement in Taiwan,Yin-an Chen,"the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement, ideology, sacredness, filling with the Holy Spirit, somatic experiences","According to theological and anthropological researchers, the Christian Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement is an‘extreme individualized religion’in which believers focus exclusively on their relationship with God. However, this article argues that because feeling ‘the sacredness’relies not only on the body and feeling but also on the cultural symbolic system, the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement is not just an‘individualized religion’even though is emphasizes the relationship between the person and God. The Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement directs to‘rightly’interpret and to feel these sacred experiences, even though religious experiences have their own subjectivity. The cultural symbolic system of the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement is a set of‘ideologies’rather than a set of symbols that people share. The church repeats the daily, weekly and yearly activities to imbue and train believers with the cultural logic of the Pentecostal/ Charismatic Movement, which helps people to interpret their daily lives and somatic experiences though these experiences do not correlate in appearance. The true function behind the ideology is to determine the meaning and sacredness of the church rather than the person who has the experience. While the personal somatic body has its subjectivity, sacredness is rendered by religious ideology. The ideology of the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement, furthermore, deceives believers to trust that they own the right to interpret the somatic experiences of being filled by the Holy Spirit and to receive revelation from God alone. However, not all experiences are sacred, whether it is sacred or not depends on how it has been judged by the ideology of the Pentecostal/ Charismatic Movement. Therefore, the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement looks like an ‘extreme individualized religion’which deceives believers to trust that they themselves own the right to interpret God's revelation. But, in fact, their logic follows by the ideology of the Pentecostal/Charismatic Movement and the body of the believer becomes a field for ideological control.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=620157437256413167,12.1,2014,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"The Aesthetics of‘Justice’among the Langalanga, Solomon Islands",Pei-yi Guo,"justice, law, indigenous culture, Oceania, Solomon Islands","This paper looks into how the concept of ‘justice’ and its ideal practice is culturally grounded. When the indigenous customary norms encounter the contemporary state legal systems, the questions of ‘what justice means’ and how it could be achieved become fundamental and challenging. In the contemporary society characterized by multi-cultural composition and global connections, divergent ideas of justice and their incongruence often underlie legal and political debates. Through ethnographic studies, especially the case of Langalanga in the Solomon Islands, this paper examines the conceptualization and imagination of justice in Oceania, and its incommensurability with the formal jurisprudential domain in the (post) colonial states. Langalanga people live in coastal or artificial islet settlements in the lagoon along the central-west coast of Malaita Island, Solomon Islands. Though a relatively small group in the island state, they dominate the boat building industry, and their shell money economy thrive within the nation. Langalanga people often translate the English term ‘justice’ as ‘radana’, which means ‘straightness’ literally, and it also connotes the intertwined meanings of sameness, rightness, and clarity. The complex idiom of radana links to high moral value, right way to do things, and is an ideal way of social life in the community. In Langalanga, as in some other Oceanic societies, the ideal dispute settlement is often expressed using the metaphor of farada (‘straighten’). Radana (farada) is not only the path to the ideal situation, but the ideal situation itself. There are several paths to farada: customary exchange and sacrificial rituals, the church way of praying together, and the ‘council of chiefs’. However, the essence to its success depends on willingness of two parties to tafa (open up) and famadakwa (clarify) the disputing points. The disentangling process of achieving radana (farada), or the ‘constraint of form‘ that radana could be perceived and reified constitutes the aesthetics of ‘justice’. Justice is always situated in the context of social networks in Oceania. The specific aesthetics of ‘justice’ in Langalanga encompass various concepts of personhood, property, liability, compensation and restorative negotiation. The court system in the Solomon Islands operates mainly according to principles of English legal tradition, the notions of justice embedded in the ‘law’ and legal procedures are alien from the rada aesthetics of justice. People are discontent with the court for failing to farada, without paying attention to the ideal of radana, the court is far away from how people believe justice could be achieved. In recent years, activists and scholars of legal reforms in Taiwan have explored the incongruences and even conflicts between the state legal system and the indigenous customs. Specific courts dealing with indigenous cases have been set up in 2013, and there are plans to establish tribal courts that follow ‘customary law’ in the future. By looking into Oceanic ethnographies as comparative references, I point out that legal reform such as the survey and coding of indigenous custom and the installation of indigenous court should pay attention to the discrepancy in the concepts and aesthetics of justice in the context of legal pluralism.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=620157437256413167,12.1,2014,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
The Road to Perfection: Personhood and Labor in Yami Culture,Hsin-chieh Kao,"Yami (Tao), the concept of personhood, labor, value, cultural structure","This article aims at sketching Yami culture as a whole, presenting a theory of Yami cultural structure, and exploring its social and material conditions. Through anthropological fieldwork in Lanyu, I argue that all the observed and recorded, seemingly contradictory characteristics among the locals, such as their generosity, self-care, activeness, conservatism, etc., are various facets of the ideal image of ‘tao’(person) in Yami culture. Such an ideal sprouts from the notion ‘all men are created labouring’ and grows under the principle ‘more pains, more gains’. For the Yami, people survive because they work, and it is optimistically believed that the harder they work, the more they obtain. Moreover, what accumulates along with labour is not only wealth but everything: people also learn more skills for living, have more stories to tell, produce more food to share and win more respect from their fellows. Poor harvest, bad fishing luck or other occasional misfortunes never negate this long-term trend in a person's life course. Eventually people reach their peak of life as they age and become rarakeh (elders_. What rarakeh own - large houses and thriving crops, comprehensive erudition and numerous offspring-prove their lifelong efforts and justify their highly esteemed status in the community. In short, a person's value is proportional to their age, which is culturally equal to their labor time. The ideal image of tao is the destination of Yami people's life journey on 'the Road to Perfection' that links life, labour, wealth, power and knowledge. Furthermore, I argue that‘the Road to Perfection’is by no means a rootless imagination among the Yami but is founded upon some solid facts that people experience and comprehend in their daily lives. The natural environment of Lanyu and, for the sake of subsistence, the locals' collective responses to it, including their reliance on human strength and individual means of production, their gendered division of labor, their planting agriculture and supportive but notable offshore fishing practices, etc., commonly shape this cultural ideal and make it a realizable one particularly on Lanyu, the Yami's‘affluent island.’In this sense, the ideal image of tao may evolve correspondingly when Yami people experience the world and the life differently. In the context of globalisation, the Yami have made many efforts, which largely follow their traditional ways and usually lack efficiency and efficacy, to adapt themselves to a modernized lifestyle and livelihood. Accordingly, some external observers over-optimistically claim that‘the Yami are still there, and they are still Yami’, and Yami culture not only survives from the tidal wave of globalization but successfully absorbs foreign elements for its own good. However, such an opinion is based on a mere illusion created by ethnographic phenomena similar to the past but with a different structure underneath, which can be distinguished only by a more sophisticated analysis of the relations and contacts between persons and things. The analytical framework presented in this article, as I hope, can be helpful to develop an integrative understanding of the past and present ethnographic phenomena in Lanyu.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=652754645213133340,12.2,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
House Society and Environmental Resource Sustainability of rGyalrong Tibetans in Denba County,"Bor-wen Tsai, Ming-kuang Chung, Yung-ching Lo, Chia-nan Lin","house society, sustainable development, environmental resource, the rGyalrong Tibetan","Recent studies of environmental resource governance turn their attention to the relationships between local knowledge and issues of sustainability, biodiversity, land use ethics, and resource management. This study selects Denba（丹巴）as the target of interest. Denba is located in Ganzi（甘孜）Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, which is an autonomous prefecture in Sichuan Province in southwestern China. Residents of Denba belong to the rGyalrong（嘉絨）ethnic group which was certified as the rGyalrong Tibetan officially in 1954 by China government. Those Tibetan communities have lived on deep slopeland for hundreds of years and survived in a self-sufficient way. The population in 2003 was 2948 persons in 551 households. Most of them were Tibetan. This study discusses the sustainable landscape in such marginal area in terms of a special social institution--house society. The translation of primogeniture, labor exchange and traditional knowledge into sustainable resource management is explored. High resolution satellite imagery was used to identify major land use types and their configurations. Field survey and interviews were employed to investigate the social and cultural aspects of the research issues. Results show that a house for a family is an exemplification of local knowledge as well as the driving force for shaping landscape. The inheritance system of a house establishes a special social and labor network. The construction of a house demonstrates the rGyalrong Tibetan's traditional skill and knowledge. The layout of a house corresponds to their daily activities and the utilization of natural resources. This indicates that the house society is a crucial issue for the sustainability of this Tibetan landscape. The spatial configuration of the landscape demonstrates the local intelligence of resource management including the terraces for cultivation, the woods between terraces for water resource conservation and building materials, the drainage system for irrigation, the use of fragmental land around houses, the seasonal grazing in alpine grasslands, and so on. The suitability of land use is actually embedded in their social institutions which are centered in the house society. However, this sustainable landscape has begun to change. We have observed the impact on traditional social institutions of phenomena such as tourism activities, dam construction, and the forest restoration policy in recent years. The challenge becomes the community adaptation to this impact. This will be an interesting issue for further research. It also reminds us that sustainability is a dynamic process. The interactions between man and environment as well as the response to the environmental, economic and political change should be considered simultaneously",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=652754645213133340,12.2,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"The Subjective Comparison of Translator, Author and Reader: Out of The Representation Crisis in Ethnography——Review on Chien, Mei-ling’s“Transcription and Translation of Hmub Antique Songs: A Song Master’s Manuscript, Knowledge, Space and Landscape”",Ju He,"ethnography, crisis of representation, subject","It seems to be a histori c predi c ament that a “crisis of representation” in ethnography could occur in anthropology at all. If “writing”（representing）means purely “reproducing the Other,” or just having professional introspection, the relationships among and between subjects and objects will be severed in anthropology. These relationships might be effectively re-associated by some new exploratory writings in ethnography, which could not only study objects, reveal the process of research, and discover the background information and knowledge production of researchers, but could also offer the space for audience participation in ethnographic narratives. In doing so, they can make a contribution to escaping from the historic predicament in anthropology. Chien, Mei-ling’s article,“Transcription and Translation of Hmub Antique Songs: A Song Master’s Manuscript, Knowledge, Space and Landscape,”makes such an effort. It not only discusses the song master authoring antique songs and displays the process through which the anthropologist writes an ethnography, it also explains the relationships among antique songs, the song master and the anthropologist thoroughly. It also offers readers an opening to participate in the ethnography. Therefore, the theoretical breakthrough of this article is that in addition to analyzing the local culture, Dr. Chien Mei-ling also reflects on the context and process of ethnographic research. In doing so, she gives the audience the opportunity to critique the ethnography, by presenting and comparing the roles of cultural translator, ethnographic author and ethnographic reader, as well as the relationships among them, within a single article. As a result, it is a creative endeavor to make an organic and integral connection among and between subjects and objects emerge from the representational crisis of ethnography. As a consequence, it finds a way to escape the dilemma of postmodern anthropology.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&SSize=10&Fid=0&MSID=652754645213133340,12.2,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Flora and fauna surveys had also just started. Inō identified snake types without the help of naturalists, so he mistaken classified “vūruns or kamavanans” in Paiwanese as the “pointed-scaled pitvipers” （龜殼花）. Paiwanese people regard hundred-pace vipers (vūruns or kamavanans) as their guardian spirit, so why do we need to explore Inō’s erroneous interpretation? Causes of Inō’s mistake are multiple: different systems of classification of biological life during the Japanese colonial period in Taiwan, language translation problems, and different anthropological theories. This paper first reviews Inō’s investigation reports to deliberate causes of his mistaking “vūruns or kamavanans” for “pointed-scaled pitvipers”, and secondly, discusses the problem about Paiwan language for naming snakes which was recorded in Roman alphabet. Finally, this paper analyzes Inō’s concept about “venomous snakes.” Inō could be credited for making important contributions, but his reports also created problems.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=654467303154005227,13.1,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"The Local Moral World and Agricultural Activities of the Committed Organic Farmer: A Case Study from an Atayal Community in Shilei, Jianshi Township, Xinzhu","Hung-yu Ru, En-chia Lo","Atayal, Christianity, committed organic farmer, local moral world, organic farming","Shilei is an important community producing organic crops in Xinzhu County in northern Taiwan. The Atayal, one of the indigenous peoples in Taiwan, make up the main population of the community. Currently, ninety percent of the Atayal farmers are engaging in organic farming in Shilei. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationships between the motivations for converting to organic from conventional farming and the local moral world of the Atayal community. Special attention is given to: (1) the factors that contribute to shaping the local moral world of the Atayal in Shilei, and (2) how the local moral world influences the cognitive processes, behaviors, and material creations of committed organic farmers when they engage in organic farming. Two years of fieldwork were carried out between 2010 and 2012. In-depth interviews and participant observation took place in the contexts of the Atayal households, organic farms and churches to study the Atayal foodways related to organic farming during the fieldwork. In addition, a number of church archives were collected for studying the history of the Charismatic Movement that took place in Shilei between the 1970s and the 1980s. Our study results show that the motivations of converting to organic farming include deteriorated health status, the degradation of the local eco-system and a poor economic condition in general. And yet, the organic farmers are not a homogenous group in terms of their attitudes, preferences, and goals of practicing organic farming. The local moral world, shaped by Christianity, the experiences of social suffering, and structural violence, has a great influence on converting to and practicing organic farming among the Atayal. Notably, the norms and values of the local moral world guide the committed organic farmers’ behaviors and material creations related to the production and marketing of organic crops, and lead this type of organic farmer to a strong motivation to produce organic crops continuously. Since the committed organic farmer has successfully created new organic technologies by adopting both the local and the Korean knowledge and skills of organic farming, and effective and efficient marketing strategies of selling organic crops, s/he has become a model for those who plan to convert to organic farming. In addition, due to her/ his Christian identity and experiences of social suffering, the committed organic farmer possesses the spirit of altruism and becomes a promoter of organic farming by sharing the organic technologies s/he created with the other farmers in the community. Consequently, the committed organic farmer within a strong local moral world plays a significant role in the promotion of organic farming in Shilei. According to this study, supporting the committed organic farmer is the priority for the development of sustainable agriculture in the indigenous community. We suggest that the government should create a friendly policy with respect to the local moral world for facilitating the committed organic farmer to create the knowledge and skills of organic farming by adopting the local and modern knowledge. Also, the government should help sell the organic crops produced by the committed organic farmer on the market. With these measures, sustainable development of organic farming may be expected to take place in the indigenous community in the near future.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=654467303154005227,13.1,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

The author’s focus, in this case is on immigrants of Pangcah people of Hualien to South Africa in the 1980s. They belonged in the past to Taiwan society’s underlying labor class, meanwhile their life in the political and economic context was of the lower class, however they have one thing in common with each other, they were Christians when living in Taiwan. During the migration and growth process, they have set up the first overseas branch of their original village church, Pangcah Presbyterian Church of Taiwan, at the border between South Africa and Lesotho, but because of severe flooding, the local government decided evacuate the town residents in 1998 and also clear all buildings, including the church. However, although the Pangcah people were scattered all over South Africa, they continue to maintain momentum as religious, self-understanding even after global immigration. The Church is a social organization seen the ""home"" (Luma) of homeland, and allows them through the concept of “home” continue, to promote local development.

The commander of the Jinmen Defense Headquarters (JDH), Hu Lian, received locally produced sorghum liquor as a gift. He was surprised by its quality and the aroma of the liquor pleased him. In 1952 JDH established a sorghum distillery. The military authorities in the 1950s began trading rice for sorghum—required in large quantities to make this type of liquor—in order to encourage the farmers to shift production. Rice and sorghum functioned more like gifts than commodities between the military and Jinmen’s farmers.

"Constructing An Exemplary Civilized Village in Xiaotun, Anyang Yin Xu: Cultural Heritage, National Narrative and Local Memory",Shu-Li Wang,"cultural heritage, civilization, place making, China, social archaeology","After the archaeological site Anyang Yin Xu, China, became a World Heritage Site in 2006, changes occurred quickly in the surrounding villages without much in the way of preparation. Xiaotun village became well known after the discovery of Shang-period oracle bone inscriptions there in the late 19th century. This fame contributed to the decision to retain the village as part of the on-going construction of the Yin Xu National Archaeological Park by local authorities. Transforming an everyday living place into a national archaeological park has both national significance and global value, and all these spaces speak to the juxtaposition of different temporalities. This transition (i.e., from ruins to heritage site) results in the competition of temporalities in a given space containing historical values that are defined by the nation as well as being a site of memory for living inhabitants. The aim of state-led nationalism in China has been to bring ‘civilization’ and progress, but local villagers who have been displaced (e.g. Huayuanzhuang villagers) or who are fighting to remain in their homes (e.g. Xiaotun villagers) view the project negatively. Part of the reason for the villagers’ dismay is the failure of tourism to bring economic prosperity. The competing sources of memory and identity have resulted in several parallel scales of failed adjustment–from central state and municipal governments to local farmers-to brand Anyang as tourist destination. Drawing on ethnographic research, this paper investigates the life experience of Xiaotun villagers in the post-World Heritage era and the social impact of processes of heritage branding. I pay special attention to the social impacts of the state-imposed projects of heritage branding and to local memories of place. I was surprised to find that the local villagers had complex feelings toward the museum, site and place. How do the local people understand the UNESCO concept of a national heritage site? How is nationalism imposed upon the local people and in what ways do they understand, interpret or resist national discourse? This account is the first to document the rapid changes in local village life near the Anyang Yin Xu archaeological site following its elevation to World Heritage status in 2006. This paper intends to share elements of cultural memory among the villagers, as well as to explore the top-down imposition of nationalism juxtaposed with local modes of resistance, interactions with national history and understandings of the UNESCO concept of a World Heritage site. The paper describes how the official desire to project a civilized image to the outside world is played out in the transformation of people’s everyday lives.

The Practice of Deference and Its Politics: Theravada Buddhist Beliefs and Hierarchical Dynamism in China’s Southwest Border Areas,Tzu-kai Liu,"hierarchical dynamism, Theravada Buddhist beliefs, religious conversion, deference, Wa Buddhists","In this article I examine the dynamics of religious and political hierarchies in Wa Buddhists’ practice of Theravada Buddhist beliefs in the Autonomous County of Cangyuan, Wa Nationality, in China’s southwest border region. Communities of Wa Buddhists in Cangyuan have gone through a number of historical phases for which the notion of “hierarchical dynamism” (Robbins 2015), is a useful theoretical framework for understanding, in particular, the workings of complex, multilayered hierarchical relations in the local history of religious conversion and practice. Here the symbolic role of the Wa king and the agentive role of senior Wa orators illustrate a feature of nested hierarchies by which the political and religious domains are contested and juxtaposed over time. In particular, the Wa deferential greetings performed by senior orators are not only confined and grounded in the religious field, but also feed into the hierarchical dynamics by which community tensions and conflicts are managed, where political distrust is expressed, and where social relations are reconfigured in light of local ethnolinguistic practices and ideas of nbuan (merit).",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=707244575230734013,13.2,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Furthermore, after the mid-nineteenth century (1850-1911), when the Qing’s inability to sustain its rule in the periphery and the arrival of the Western colonial powers increasingly accentuated the “multinational frontier” aspect of Southwest Yunnan, the Flower Lisu were still able to maneuver their way in the political and economic systems by choosing the most suitable “ruler” for themselves.

In addition, the oral history obtained by field work provides a complementary emic perspective regarding the way of Flower Lisu are constructing their own historical memory of being part of the Qing’s “ruled resources.” Finally, the discussion further extends to how the Flower Lisu’s migration to Burma’s Kachin State, Shan State, and Northern Thailand is closely related to their choice of being part of the Qing’s force.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=707244575230734013,13.2,2015,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"The Construction of “Authenticity”: The Production, Representation and Transformation of “Taiwanese Cuisine” in Tokyo",Yujen Chen,"authenticity, Taiwanese cuisine, historical construction, ethnic restaurant, Tokyo","This article examines the production, representation, and transformation of the “Taiwanese cuisine” in restaurants at in Tokyo, analyzing how these restaurants interpret and represent “authentic Taiwanese cuisine.” Tracing the history of “Taiwanese cuisine restaurants” in Tokyo from the early 20th century, when Taiwan was under the colonial rule of Japan, this article aims to explore the historical construction of the notion of “authenticity” mainly in two aspects: the historical contexts of the producers (owners and chefs of Taiwanese restaurants in Tokyo), and the transformation of the identification and consumers’ consciousness of “authentic Taiwanese cuisine.” This study shows that the boundary between Taiwanese cuisine and Chinese cuisine had has been vague since the notion of “Taiwanese cuisine” appeared in the early 20th century. Although it had developed diverse local or regional dishes had developed in Taiwan during the colonial period, such as sautéed fish wuliu (literally five willow branches) and flying fish stewed with pickled mango, these dishes were not textualized and provided served in restaurants. By contrast, those the “Taiwanese cuisine” enjoyed by the upper class in exclusive restaurants were was mainly of Chinese origins, which resulting in the vague boundary between Chinese cuisine and Taiwanese cuisine even in Taiwan. The “Taiwanese restaurants” appeared in Tokyo during the colonial period, and the number grew mainly during the economic bubble of Japan since the second half of the late 1980s to late 1990s. Many Taiwanese migrated to Japan with the help from relatives who had studied or worked in Japan before the 1970s. As many Taiwanese restaurants were ran run by migrant families, the “authentic Taiwanese cuisine” was gradually came to be understood as family dishes or small-plate dishes since the 1980s. There were also restaurants run by Japanese businessmen or the descendants of those Japanese who grew up in Taiwan during the colonial period. In both cases, hand-making and the maintenance of key flavors of Taiwanese dishes are important strategies to identify the “authenticity” of Taiwanese dishes. However, with the increasing bodily experience as of tourists and media audiences particularly after the year 2000, the meaning of authentic Taiwanese food has been changed, referring to newly emerging label signature foods like beef noodles and bubble tea. As “authenticity” is a field of contest, the consciousness and expectations of consumers keeps changing the representation of Taiwanese cuisine in Tokyo. In this context, night market foods and famous Taiwanese enterprises provide a simple way to perform “Taiwanese cuisine” as the boundary between Taiwanese cuisine and Chinese cuisine is still vague. Based on the exploration of Taiwanese restaurants at in Tokyo, this article further argues that the “authenticity” of cuisines in ethnic restaurants can be analyzed at three levels. The first level is the historical contexts and personal experiences of producers, which constitute construct their identification of “authentic ethnic cuisines.” The second is the core factors of the “authenticity” as identified by producers, such as the key flavors of food, which is are closely related to the producers’ cultural identity and can be hardly are not easily changed. The third level is the supplementary factors of the “authenticity”, which is changing change along with consumers’ expectations and new trends. The analysis of the above levels in this research shows that the identification of authenticity is not only a choice between business and culture, but also the historical construction of ethnic cuisine involving the negotiation between producers and consumers of different periods and backgrounds.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/content/Periodicals/Content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MsID=710600570137156232,14.1,2016,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
The Resilient Landscape: Fijian Village Gardens in the Age of Commercial Agriculture,Hao-Li Lin,"Fiji, landscape, commercial agriculture, land tenure, walking and seeing","Commercial agriculture in the Pacific has typically resulted in increased monoculture, reliance on purchased food, and environmental degradation. This is particularly the case on Taveuni Island, Fiji, a wellknown hotspot for commercial taro enterprises. Using ethnographic data on the agricultural landscape in an indigenous Fijian community there, I demonstrate how the community maintains a degree of crop diversity and flexible land-use arrangements despite the sweeping effects of exportbased farming practices. The capacity for diversity and flexibility, I argue, is sustained in a landscape consisting of hilly terrain with fragmented gardens, which enables the community to respond resiliently to the disciplining influence of commercial agriculture, even while engaging in many of its practices. I also point out that the everyday acts of walking and seeing in the rugged landscape are neglected aspects of farming that allow the villagers to maintain a profound connection to an environment filled with meaning, memories, and a sense of time. This agricultural landscape is forever a complex social space, rather than a place defined solely by commercial productivity. The results of this study show how resilience may be cultivated in indigenous agricultural systems even given the impact of globalization.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/content/Periodicals/Content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MsID=710600570137156232,14.1,2016,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Blood and Soil: Yami Social Institutions Revisited,Hsin-chieh Kao,"Yami (Tao), social structure, kinship, property, social production and reproduction","This article aims at explicating the social institutions of the Yami of Lanyu and re-evaluating related anthropological theories and debates of the past fifty years. My discussions begin with a somewhat old-school but unsettled debate in Yami ethnography: Is Yami society ‘patrilineal’ or ‘bilateral’? Both ethnographers and the locals agree that Yami society reveals clear ‘patrilineality’ and ‘bilateralism’ at the same time. That is, the Yami put equal stress on patrilateral and matrilateral kin ties but also show an obvious ‘patri bias’, emphasizing solidarity among agnates in particular. As a result, the usual answer to this typological question is either that Yami society is structured according to patrilineality with a complementary principle of bilateralism or just the reverse. In the last wave of this long lasting debate, Yami society was said to be a bilateral society with patrilineal inclination, which operates on the basis of the social functions of zipos (relatives), a kind of bilateral kindred. However, the existence of patrilineality had been left unexplained until today. In my opinion, the ‘patrilinealty vs. bilateralism’ debate reflects epistemological and ontological confusions lurking in Yami ethnography and kinship studies. On the one hand, the recognition of patrilineality and ‘patrilineal descent groups’ is through ‘the soil’, based on data concerning estate and land tenure, while the recognition of bilateralism and ‘kindred and kith’ is through ‘the blood’, based on observations of the collaboration among consanguineally related persons. In other words, it was the biased selection and use of ethnographic materials that resulted in the diverging development of social theories and their contradiction. The core of the debate is not, as some researchers thought, the opposition between cultural ideals and social facts. Patrilineality is not simply a descent ideology that exists in the locals’ minds, but in the practice of the inheritance of estates, a part of social institutions. Both patrilineality and bilateralism are social facts. On the other hand, patrilineality and bilateralism are not the double standard that the Yami use to recognize consanguinity. Despite the use of ‘kinship’ concepts on the surface, both are expressions of the local political, economic, and jural relations and refer to parallel regulations inside Yami society. Whereas patrilineality regulates the transfer of land, the major means of production, bilateralism regulates the use of manpower, the major productive force. Nevertheless, patrilineality and bilateralism are of one common origin rather than being two separate domains. Both come from the framing relations in asa ka vahay (household), i.e. filiation and conjugality, and serve the ultimate goal of the social production and reproduction of asa ka vahay. A key point of this understanding is the covert status of women, whose labour and property are of indisputable importance but are often underestimated by ethnographers, and even by the locals themselves. Patrilineality, in fact, is merely the outstanding half of the ‘bilineality’ in Yami society, due to the highly visible estate and its increasing scarcity. By and large, under the co-regulation of bilineality and bilateralism, the reproduction of Yami society takes the form of neverending replication of asa ka vahay, the basic unit of Yami social structure, instead of everlasting existence of corporations such as descent groups or polities.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=712171645716124732,14.2,2016,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
From West to East: Rethinking Social Organization and Kinship studies in the Tibetan Himalayas through a Comparison between Sherpas and rGyalrongs,Ting-yu Wang,"Himalayan Tibetan area, mind of Asiatic grouping, heterogeneity, social organization, kinship","The extant literature in Himalayan Tibetan studies describes a highly unified Tibetan culture. Through this literature we can observe that Tibetans living in the western and central parts of the Himalayas present a high degree of homogeneity in history, social organization and kinship. In contrast, Tibetan communities in the eastern part display a broad heterogeneity in all these areas. In addition to Tibetan Buddhism—which produces a homogeneity that spreads from a center to the periphery in a top-down direction—another regime that produces homogeneity is the grouping strategy of Tibetan societies, whose direction is bottom-up and diffuse from periphery to center. This includes the systems of patrilineal lineage, polyandry, matrilineal cross-cousin marriage and the concepts of “flesh” and “bone”. In recent years, studies have begun to emerge that explore the diversity of the Tibetan culture circle’s eastern regions. The diversity of religion in the Amdo Tibetan area has been systematically and comparatively discussed by Mona Schrempf (1999, 2006). And while research mentions that there is also great variation in both social organization and kinship in Eastern Khamba (Zhang Jianshi 2000), there has yet to be research that has explored this region in comparison with Tibet in a holistic way. In this paper, through a comparison between Zhuokeji rGyalrong people in the Eastern edge of the Himalayas and the Sherpa occupied Western edge. I will focus on analysis of the differences in social organization and kinship to emphasize the uniqueness of the Eastern Himalayan region. Building on the works of Paul Benedict (1942) and Claude Lévi-Strauss (1969[1949]) whose research through the perspectives of language and culture lead them to conclude social groupings in Asia presented a particular “mind of Asiatic grouping,” I will demonstrate that not only have the Eastern Himalayan areas constituted an absent presence in the entirety of the Tibetan Himalayas, but that the East also presents a distinct area with its own historical, social, linguistic and cultural characteristics.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=712171645716124732,14.2,2016,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Mopo, Mama, Niangniang and I: Reflecting on Fieldwork Experiences and Knowledge Production of Zhuang Ritual Study",Ya-ning Kao,"Zhuang people, gender, fieldwork experience, knowledge production, autoethnography","At present, research on Zhuang rituals reveals an obvious division of labor between the sexes. Most male researchers, both local or and foreign, have focused their studies on male ritual specialists. However, this gendered division of labor is at odds with the realities of Zhuang ritual. For example, mopo and mogong ritual specialists conduct ritual orally and—because both male or and female dead ritual masters, ancestors, and spirit soldiers may pos-sesses her/himthem—their sex is not always the same as their gender in the ritual. This article offers an autoethnography as I explore my own fieldwork experience among women-dominated Zhuang ritual groups and investigate how status, gender and the degree of participant-observation impact knowledge production. In discussing this research and my experience as an ethnographer, this article makes a case for “collaborative ethnography” as a method—cooperating with ritual specialists, local and outside researchers, common people, and government officials—to produce an ethnography on Zhuang ritual specialists. I argue that this method will help research participants negotiate conflicts in the process of knowledge production while at the same time transcending the barriers of gender, status, ethnic group and literacy to develop a new way to transmit and inherit both Zhuang religious and anthropological knowledge.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=745170567717415637,15.1,2017,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

"Informal Standardisation and Moral Economy : The Response and Negotiation of Global Standards in an Electronic Factory in Shenzhen, Post-Mao China",I-Chieh Fang,"global standard, informal sphere, moral economy, disembeddedment, emotion","In response to the expansion of the global market, flexibility is the significant process drawing lots of attention in the late capitalist’s mode of production, but the standardization is still worth discussion in the global South. The factories coastal Chin like Shenzhen, the labour force (‘workers’) are mostly young people from rural village. The factory adopts the ISO 9000, a standard operational and management system, which provided by International organization for standardization (ISO) to re-organized itself. It intends to quickly establish a mechanism to convert migrant workers’ subjectivity to fit into the mode of production of global capitalism. Through ISO 9000, the factory gains the certificate for its products to enter into global market. Theoretically, implementation of ISO 9000 is arguably the invasion of global market forces, which will result in the separation of production mode and society, and the ‘disembeddedment’ will then follow. This paper investigates the extent to which ISO 9000 will break down existing social relations and penetrate social boundaries by conducting long-term fieldwork in an electronics factory observing how ISO 9000 implement and its required programs of education and training. This study looks at the process of standardization from a perspective of moral economy, which emphasizes the consensus and negotiations between social actors in the context of daily life, in order to correct the market in the political economy view. The study found that when the factory and the migrant workers in the face of imposed ISO 9000, their response is not to reject or resist, but to accommodate at the first glance. However, privately they de-standardization the ISO 9000 and at the same time ‘restandardization’ the implicit rules of their interactions and exchange by their own way, through emotions and gestures, which are both silent and invisible in the documents. The tacit agreement between workers and managers co-exist in the factory with ISO 9000 market rules. This allows migrant workers find the cracks to negotiate their agency under the scientific management, to retrieve the rhythm of the work process, and to rebuild the social relationship which market penetrates. It is arguable that due to the moral economy and the market economy go hand in hand, it makes Chinese factories in the global market disembedded while reembedded in the society.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=745170567717415637,15.1,2017,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

With the inauguration of a rapid transit system in 2009 and the redevelopment of the coastal region for commerce and tourism in recent years, it reemerged and metamorphosed into a tourist destination. As the city government moves ahead with the new transport network and developing tourism, local organizations center their arguments for a more inclusive city on the preservation of railway facilities and reclaiming neighborhood streets via a number of new activities. By considering on one hand the redevelopment of the waterfront by a city government trying to rebrand Kaohsiung as a global capital and secure popular support, and on the other, local efforts to preserve a train station from the Japanese colonial period and other actions taken to (re)claim city streets, this article examines how a cityscape designed for capital flow and political control is reinvented and reinterpreted by its residents as the Hámásing neighborhood is squeezed in the city’s post-industrial transformation.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=777704404105035707,15.2,2017,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"An Actor-Network Analysis of the “Building Solar Farms over Fish Ponds” Scheme: Local Government, Solar PV Firms, and Local Farmers",Hung-jen Yang,"Solar farms, Actor-Network Theory, Infrastructure, Heterogeneous Governance, Translation","The scene of the solar PV industry coexisting with agricultural and aqua-cultural industries has recently appeared on the Pingtung Plain, particularly in the areas where land subsidence becomes serious. This phenomenon, resulting from the project of “building solar farms over fish ponds,” shows the dynamic aspect of an infrastructure characterized by the interweaving of the technical and the social. In the summer of 2009, after Typhoon Morakot, the county magistrate of Pingtung formed an interdepartmental working group on green energy, endeavoring to integrate three tasks, i.e. post-disaster reconstruction, area restoration, and green energy transformation. In the process of post-disaster reconstruction, the working group on green energy functioned as a significant translator among heterogeneous elements, a role that could be further called an “actor of heterogeneous governance.” As a representative of the local government, the green energy working group coordinated with the Council for Economic Planning and Development of the Executive Yuan to form an inter-departmental mechanism for area restoration. Meanwhile, with a working mode of cooperation and learning, which emphasized joint efforts to diagnose the problems and seek the solutions, the green energy working group established a new mechanism for mutual learning and local invention in which diverse roles were included, such as department directors and members of the local government, local experts, organizations for cultural preservation and ecological conservation, solar PV firms, and subcontractors. Through the application of Actor-Network Theory, this analysis follows the green energy working group, farmers of wax-apples and aqua-cultural fish ponds, various solar PV firms, and other technical artifacts and technological systems. Using a symmetrical approach to humans and nonhumans, this paper seeks to explore how the actor of heterogeneous governance connected heterogeneous elements and facilitated a common trajectory of action in their common interest, how the negotiations between local knowledge and expert knowledge, between local categories and global categories, were brought about, how the locality could maintain a flexible border after shifting when a distant heterogeneous element took part, and how the actor of heterogeneous governance could serve as a mechanism for power balance, allowing the green energy capital of the solar PV industry to be properly harnessed by the locality.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=777704404105035707,15.2,2017,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"The Interweaving of Water Infrastructure and Society: A Case Study of the Construction and Management of Irrigation in Kalibuan Community, Taiwan",Ching-hsiu Lin,"infrastructure, irrigation, water management, property relations, Bunun people","Based on ethnographic research from 2011 to 2014 in Kalibuan community, in the Chenyuland River Catchment in Taiwan, this article examines how indigenous people have constructed and shaped their own irrigation system and methods of water management. This case study has significant implications for addressing problems relating to water access in indigenous communities. The majority of residents in Kalibuan community are from the Bunun people, and their communal irrigation system is unique. Generally, most communities in mountain areas do not use communal irrigation systems, rather, farmers individually maintain private, small-scale irrigation systems. As a consequence, many communities have experienced water shortage and conflicts over access to water. This article focuses in particular on how engagement with the infrastructure of irrigation systems is experienced and interpreted within local social, political, and cultural contexts. Drawing on theoretical insights from Actant-Network theory and anthropological perspectives on property relations and ownership, I describe how interactions between actors are involved in the dynamic processes of property negotiations. This research suggests that property negotiations not only generate ongoing ways of owning and using water, but also define a geographical and ideological boundary in the community’s irrigation infrastructure network. I argue that this boundary is key to enabling residents to form effective methods of water management, to turning their community into a ‘hydro-society’, and to shaping good ‘hydro-citizens’. Finally, this article discusses Bunun thinking in relation to irrigation infrastructure, and how they have attempted to find better ways of water management that reflect Bunun concepts of ‘human-water’ relations, social structure, and culture.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=777704404105035707,15.2,2017,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Education is regarded as social infrastructure which is significant to the development of theculture and society of a country. ‘Education’ refers to the process of giving and receiving systematic instruction at schools or universities, whereas ‘learning’ is informal and usually related to cultural transmission. In the past ten years, the government of Taiwan set up various projects to forge the connection between universities and their local societies. These projects establish courses with the intention of bringing students to engage in practical study within actual society, working with people in local communities.

"Compelling Categories, Shifting Identities: Social Media, Transnational Cultural Politics, and “T/Po/Bufen” Lesbian Identity Formation",Yu-Ying Hu,"social media, transnational cultural politics, T/Po/bufen, lesbian identity formation, queer anthropology","Enlightened by scholarship in queer anthropology and transnational sexuality, this article explores how younger generations of lesbians in contemporary Taiwan use the identity categories of “T”, “Po”, “bufen”, “nutongzhi”, “transgender”, “bisexual” etc. to conceptualize and categorize their genders and sexual desires under the condition of flourishing social media and transnational cultural politics. This article first reviews the cultural hierarchy between identity categories of “T/Po” and “bufen” developed in the modern Taiwanese lesbian movement. I proposes the concept of the “politics of categorization” to elucidate how power relations between global and local knowledges of gender and sexuality effect a redefinition of the boundary of T/Po identity categories and lead to a realignment of the mechanisms of subject inclusion and exclusion in the context of the building of Taiwan’s modern, democratic, and sovereign nationhood. Through my ethnographic research, I delineate how the identity categories of T/Po dominate lesbians’ identity formation and social interaction when the Internet becomes the principle social space in contemporary lesbian communities. However, the contested ideologies and the realignment of categorical boundaries also lead younger generation of lesbians to continuously approach and deviate from the above-mentioned identity categories, undergoing a journey of complex self-interrogation in the attempt to form an identity. Through this analysis, this article demonstrates how the encounter between a highly westernized Taiwanese tongzhi movement and local sexual culture produces a massive and complicated symbolic system of identity categories defined by uncertainty and fluidity. The efforts made by young lesbians to identify and position themselves in a heteronormative world are thus turned into a unique but endlessly hybridizing and fluctuating process, further complicating the impact of globalizing LGBT identity politics.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1001520467667373731,16.1,2018,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Quest for Beauty and Becoming a Mother: A Painful Paradox for Highly Educated, Urban Taiwanese Women",Amélie Keyser-Verreault,"Neoliberalism, Pregnancy, Gender, Human capital, Beauty ideal","This paper explores the ramifications that the ideal of beauty has on the experience of becoming a mother among educated urban women. For many women in Taiwan, beauty significantly contributes to a successful marriage, and this quest for beauty influences their whole lives. Undeniably, Taiwan has a modern economy, but marriage and starting a family is still valued, even for highly educated professional women. I analyze women’s preoccupation with beauty from a critical perspective on neoliberal ideology. I will argue that beauty can be understood as contributing to women’s human capital and the preoccupation with beauty in terms of aesthetic entrepreneurship. From this theoretical perspective, I show that Motherhood’s consequences for women’s bodies and the lack of resources to invest in one’s beauty, in term of money and time, are incompatible with Taiwanese beauty norms. Hence the painful paradox for many women in a society in which they are expected both to have children and to make themselves beautiful.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1001520467667373731,16.1,2018,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Comparison as Reflexive Practice: Old Paths and New Approaches to Comparative Studies in Ethnomusicology,Hsin-Wen Hsu,"Ethnomusicology, Comparative Methods, Reflexivity, Taiwan Hakka Music, Finnish Pelimanni Music","This article explores the diverse modes of comparison in Ethnomusicology, and proposes the notion and strategies of “comparison as reflexive practice,” based on the author’s ethnographic and comparative study of the institutionalization of Finnish pelimanni and Taiwanese Hakka music. Deeply shaped by the cultural relativism of Anthropology, Ethnomusicology shifted the traditional paradigm of Comparative Musicology while being institutionalized as an academic discipline in postwar North America. Since then, most ethnomusicologists have recognized the importance of fieldwork for the study of music culture, they have emphasized that researchers cannot merely sit in the armchair comparing or contrasting archival data produced by other researchers, but have to learn to play the music they study and conduct ethnographic research to gain deeper understanding of the research subject. Nevertheless, this “ethnographic turn” doesn’t mean that ethnomusicologists stop doing comparison or denying the usefulness of comparison. I discuss recent criticism and reflection on existing comparative research in Ethnomusicology, Anthropology and other neighboring fields of cultural analysis. In addition, I analyze comparative studies in Ethnomusicology, arguing that at least five modes of comparison are prominent across these studies. Furthermore, based on my own research experience as well as other ethnographers’ commentaries on comparison, I suggest comparison in the ethnographer’s eye is not just about identifying similarities and differences between cases in comparison. In contrast, it entails a complicated process of theory construction through which a researcher creates meaningful ties across different contexts. I indicate comparison takes place in ethnographers’ exploration and inscription, through which they construct comparabilities across contexts and the horizon of both the research subject and the cases in comparison transforms. In addition, I propose a series of strategies useful for turning comparison into reflexive practice, analyzing the ways by which they help unveil assumptions that have been taken for granted, recontextualize and connect cultural practices and social actions/interactions apart from each other, and facilitate researchers’ efforts to “see the forest for the trees” in the process of knowledge construction.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1001520467667373731,16.1,2018,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Ethnic Boundaries and the Identity Gradient: Diet And Ethnicity of the Hui Ethnic Group in Laoma Village, Longchuan County, Yunnan",Rong Gui,"Hui ethnic group in the borderland, diet, ethnicity, ethnic boundary, identity gradient","Laoma village is part of the community of the borderland multiethnic region. It is representative of communities which consist of the Hui plus multiple other ethnic groups. It has the internal homogeneity of the Chinese Hui nationality, and as well as national marginality and particularity, which is manifest in the permeable ethnic boundaries and gradiated ethnic identities which are based in the interactions between the Hui and other local nationalities. Focusing on the diet of Hui village people, which plays a symbolic role of Hui ethnicity, the author discusses the close relationship between diet and ethnicity from both collective and individual perspectives. An important feature of Hui marginality is that ethnic identity is primarily based on constructivism and on the living practices which are commonly disjointed from the concept of Halal. The formation of the identity gradient among the Hui of Laoma village is closely related to the particular cultural ecology and the national frontier system of the multi-ethnic borderland in western Yunnan. The author analyzes the factors in this formation from the microscopic, middle view, and macroscopic perspectives. The possible theoretical contributions and reflections on Hui ethnicity, marginalized ethnic groups, and frontier ethnic relationships lie in two aspects: firstly, in terms of the study of Hui nationality this case provides some reflection on the center from the position of marginality, secondly, in terms of theoretical analysis toosl and methodology, this case study has a certain value.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1001520467667373731,16.1,2018,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Sugary Colonialism: From Sugar Plantation Colonialism to Tourism Colonialism,"Ya-hung Huang, Chun-chieh Chi","indigenous traditional territory, tribal mapping, Pangcah People, Taiwan Sugar Company Hualien Sugar Factory, Danong Da-fu Plain Forest Park","In 2002, this research involved in the project of tribal mapping of Karowa traditional territory that used to be owned by Pangcah People. Contrary to the common belief that sugar industry was the driving force of Taiwan’s economy, the project found that the “success” of sugar economy was made possible by depriving indigenous people from their land by colonizers, and thereby causing indigenous people to lose their livelihood, culture, and identity. By exploring how Karowa traditional territory had become the base for sugar industry development, we attempt to reveal the injustice of land appropriation during Japanese colonial era. We also indicate that such injustice did not end with the end of Japanese colonial regime, nor with the end of martial law period during KMT’s regime, it continues with new tourism industry development based in the same traditional territory of the Pangcah people. This paper indicates that Taiwan’s indigenous peoples have attempted to recapture the autonomy of traditional territories in the way of reterritorialization through participatory mapping, which is for interpreting independently that their traditional territories are not terra nullius, but also indigenous peoples have existed in Taiwan at least for hundreds of years before the arrival of colonizers. Besides, this paper points out that the return of indigenous traditional territories not only involves indigenous people’s autonomy issue, but also involve whether non-indigenous people are aware of and recognize that the touristic space involved is on the indigenous peoples’ traditional territories. Nonindigenous people could be the unconscious ethnic oppressor if they are denied access to the true story of land appropriation of indigenous traditional territory by the colonizer. This paper also discusses about and makes recommendations on how the Taiwanese society can begin to work toward recreating “the native space,” and to undo the injustice that has inflicted upon indigenous people for many decades.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1036224151566003536,17.1,2019,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

This article considers the reproduction of Hoklo Taiwanese kin groups (jia) in a contemporary Taiwanese village, focusing on relations impacted by multiple human and non-human factors. The research was conducted in a Hoklo village in Chianan plain area. Six examples were analyzed for their reproduction of jia through the inheritance of houses. People reproduced kinship relations through co-residence in traditional-styled compounds before the 1960s. Co-residence has gradually fallen out of favor. However, people reinterpret and reorganize “incoherent” relations that emerged from past co-residences. Decision-chains between or across multiple generations link jia and their relations vertically. As houses and kinship ideals bridge these inter-generational decision-chains, we see how both human and non-human factors create the dynamics of the jia’s reproduction.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1036224151566003536,17.1,2019,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Towards an Anthropology of Heritage Imaginaries: Penang Case Study,Wei-I LEE,"heritage imaginaries, mediators, representation, walking, intangible cultural heritage, George Town","Facing the vogue of the heritage study over decades, what can contemporary anthropology do? This paper aims to propose an approach of heritage imaginaries, based on observations at the World Heritage site George Town, Penang, Malaysia. First, in presenting debates occurred during the elaboration process of Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) conventions at UNESCO, I will briefly examine two new roles that anthropologists are playing in the renewal of the contemporary World Heritage regime: participant decision-making and observation of mediation activities. Then, through a case study of the experiences of ICH preservation work carried out in Penang, I highlight the limitations of a rescue mentality and the archiving process, review the difficulties of ICH safeguarding, and clarify the anthropological perspective on ICH as “representation.” Finally, in order to explore a new approach for the anthropological study of heritage, I will propose to take the heritage mediators as objects of research, and observe the work of imagination in concrete walking experiences. In my conclusion, I try to elaborate the concept of “heritage imaginaries” with three principal ideas crystallised through the Penang case: the return to traditional context as a tool of imagination, the construction of intangible infrastructures as imaginative engineering, and information exchanges as sources of imagination.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1070562714151374605,17.2,2019,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

The ethnography mainly depicts why volunteers were motivated to enter the debris, sweeping and investigating cultural resources there. Also, it focuses on how they weave the interaction between human and “non-human” inside the heterotopic space. The research indicates that heritage volunteers, different from volunteers in modern religious groups and communities, were multiple, heterogeneous, and constantly changing. In addition, they included local citizens, ordinary people, and local elites.

The Politics of Redistribution under New Governmentality: The Case of Rice Industry Transformation in Chihshang Township,"Naiwen Wang, Shiun-wey Huang","geographical indication, governmentality, redistribution, neoliberalism, transformation of rice industry","Suffering from the impact of the WTO, the grain merchants of Chihshang Township strove to find a new model for rice purchasing and selling through geographical indication. However, early Taiwanese trademark laws forbade the use of location name for profit. To overcome this regulation, the Chihshang grain merchants united as one group to use the logo of Chihshang Township to represent their legal status, but due to the poor recognition of the Chihshang Township logo in the market, this plan failed. Later, due to the WTO including the protection of intellectual property rights as one important provision, the grain merchants ultimately benefited from Taiwan’s entrance and were able to register the term Chihshang for geographical indication. Once public property, the location name gained commodity-like characteristics, and different powers eagerly focused on how to distribute the new rights and profits. At the same time, a new governmentality was born after the registration of geographical indication. Although the income of Chihshang peasants increased due to the success of the “Chihshang brand,” the basic contradiction of profit distribution between grain merchants and peasants was not resolved. The officer who promoted the geographical indication effectively became the head of the township and actively dealt with the structural problem of distribution within the rice industry. This action re-articulated the peasants` imagination of state effect and helped him acquire the support of most townspeople and become the first person to run unopposed in the 2018 Chihshang township election.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1070562714151374605,17.2,2019,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Using participant observation and in-depth interviews, I explore how these directors revolutionized discourses of collective Indigenous identities and revitalized local cultures through documentary films and independent public screenings. I also consider some of the challenges and complexities these directors faced while filming in their native communities. Through these reflections, this article raises ethical questions around conflict management during collaborative filming, what is left unseen and unsaid, and how directors negotiate their own identities as insiders in relation to their work.

In George Town, Penang (Malaysia), a world heritage site listed since 2008, Chinese Kongsi own massive collective property in the historical quarters, such as ancestral halls, temples, and shop houses. This article will examine the particular process of Kongsi becoming heritage, and try to initiate a discussion of some meanings of world heritage that are not yet apparent, in a specific historical context and contemporary situation. We will explore the particular Kongsi heritagescape in George Town, first by walking through its core zone, and recalling different heritage actions led by these traditional Chinese Kongsi, along with governmental forces and NGOs, in response to UNESCO’s initiative. Then we will analyze some events and changes that have occurred, from narratives to management, during this process, and bring out different subjects involved in this heritage dynamic, such as ancestors or citizens, are imagined. Going back in history, we ask how the Chinese Kongsi, as world heritage, should face the history of coolies that was inseparable from its own.

This saying hinges on the belief in penunggu (spirit guardians). Locals from different ethnicities—Chinese, Dayak, and Malay—all believe in the presence of penunggu in their surroundings. If these beings are disturbed, they will cause sickness or discomfort. To appease them and cure illness, people rely on the help of tatung (spirit mediums).

"Planning as Promise: Meetings, the Language of the State, and Community Action in the Humanities Innovation and Social Practice Project",Shaw-wu Jung,"plan, promise, meeting, governance, humanity innovation and social practice project","Anthropology generally regards the state and bureaucracy as instrumental and symbolic, the former based on its utilitarian rationality, while the latter on its relationships with local culture. Taking the case of planning, I further point out that attention should be paid to its potency to conjure emotions among the people, and how it promises, much as a religion promises its devotees, to let people become part of a much larger meaningful totality, and more, willful agents of state governance. This article draws on my participation in the Humanities Innovation and Social Practice Project under the Ministry of Science and Technology from 2013 to 2016. It explores how the Project stimulates people’s engagement through three kinds of meeting: meetings between the funding agency and the Investigation Team, between members of the Investigation Team, and between the Investigation Team and collaborative groups. The paper first explores how planning develops into the mechanism of a promissory future, and second examines the gaps between the promise and the discontent that arises as a result of negotiations and attunements among various agents.

The Meeting As Convergence and Competition of Future Temporalities: An Ethnographic Analysis of the Environmental Impact Assessment of Taiwan’s Offshore Wind Development,Hsin-yi Lu,"Environmental impact assessment, offshore wind energy, meeting, temporality, future","Environmental impact assessment is the main channel for citizens to participate in science and technology risk assessment within the system, so EIA meetings often become the main battlefield for all parties to express their opinions and debate the fate of an development project. Inspired by recent anthropological theorization on time and temporality, this paper argues that the EIA is not just a negotiation of the allocation of space and environmental resources. The EIA meeting is also a convergence of competing temporalities. This article uses the EIA meetings for an offshore wind development project as the field site and the topic of analysis, in which the future of Taiwan energy deployment is at stake. I divide the temporal dimensions of the opinions expressed in the EIA meetings into the ""distant future"", the ""near future"", and the ""immediate expectation moment."" The government and the developer have promised a grand vision of the distant future of the energy structure and marine environment through the planning of large-scale infrastructure. However, the expert committee members of the EIA meeting can only perform in the near future that can be grasped by current scientific and technological capabilities. The public participation in the EIA process is, on the one hand, summoned or provoked by the long-term vision promised by largescale infrastructures, on the other hand, the meeting is a field of opinion for discursive confrontation, in which the actors experience a series of immediate and irreversible anticipatory moments. Every moment of excited evocation (on or off stage) points to a new beginning of the next unknown moment, and this is the main factor that attracts people to participate in the meetings. During the EIA process, from local briefings and public hearings to ad hoc committee meetings in the conference room of the EPA, the proportion of discussions about the distant future has gradually been replaced by near-future technical predictions, and thus the enthusiasm for public participation has also declined.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1125115554721550447,18.2,2020,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Vital Tribe, Empowered Evaluation? Ethnographic Observation at the Site of the Indigenous Vital Tribe Program",Wen-ling Lin,"the indigenous vital tribe program, evaluation meeting, parliament of things, more-than-human perspective, heterogeneous assembly","Under the impact of neo-liberalism and global capital flows, as well as the rapid social changes and the flourishing of individualism, the traditional tribal cultures of the indigenous peoples in Taiwan have become increasingly emptied out, and the tribal collective support systems have gradually declined. In view of this, the Council of Indigenous Peoples started the Indigenous Tribe Vitality Program in 2012, hoping to unite the strength of the tribal members through mutual assistance, co-eating, sharing, and co-production to maintain the stability of tribal survival. The Indigenous tribal vitality program is implemented through tribal meetings to form consensus and complete its public affairs participation. In addition, in order to truly understand the implementation of the vitality program of each tribe and the effectiveness of the promotion of the program, the administrative part of the promotion program requires a mid-term visit and a final local evaluation meeting. Experts, scholars, and administrators make up the members of the mid-term visit and the local evaluation meeting at the end of the period. They are also used to screen the tribes that can be continuously funded in the next year and that can serve as models for the guidance and development of the vital tribes in the future. The mid-term visit and final evaluation mechanism is to guide and identify the foundation and structure of tribal activation and the vision of sustainable management. This article takes the final evaluation meetings of the Indigenous Tribes Vitality Program as the field for observation and proposes a different research approach from the existing humancentered perspective of the meeting. It observes, describes, and discusses the ""parliament of things"" composed of the agentive perspectives of objects, the environment, places, bodies, and materials, as well as their revealed trajectories, and their relationship with other entities. Through the speaking and self-narration of things, researchers will be able to detect and identify all kinds of things and their dynamic generation in the evaluation meeting, as well as understand how they penetrate the evaluation meetings, affecting the form, boundaries and connotations of the meetings.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1125115554721550447,18.2,2020,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Bypassing, Repairing, and “Mobile Learning”: A Learning Ethnography of Shenzhen Young Migrant Workers’ “Being a Boss” and “Seeing the World”",I-chieh Fang,"penetration, de-skilling, informal learning, mobility, labour","In Paul Willis’s “Learning to Labour”, the lads articulate ‘anti-school culture’ as their reaction after penetrating/seeing through the schooling mechanism. This paper will demonstrate some other reactions to seeing through the school system, through the case of migrant workers in Shenzhen China. These reactions are: bypass, repair, and “mobile learning”. By analyzing the learning strategies displayed by a group of young migrant workers in an electronics factory, who left school out of choice but were keen to learn, this paper argues that “mobile learning” allows social actors to imagine and realize new possibilities without challenging the existing structure. Migrant workers use this method to bypass and repair the school system which is falling apart. This paper points out that migrant workers who drop out from school are not “bad students.” This label is not helpful for understanding their situation or for solving their problems. Their problems cannot be solved by exhausting various resources to help them become “good students.” These young migrant workers are not backward, unteachable, unmotivated, or unwilling to learn. Rather, they saw through the middleclass nature of schooling and its urban bias, and realized it cannot possibly help them improve their livelihoods. They become wage labourers in factories in Shenzhen as the result of finding alternatives. Migrant workers who engage in “mobile learning” move to different places and social contexts. On the one hand, through “legitimate peripheral participation,” they gain knowledge and skills in that social context, and they collate and assemble such learning resources for their own use. On the other hand, they mobilize cultural taste, social experiences, and symbols between urban and rural settings, and thus create social, cultural, and symbolic capital which enables them to transform their subjectivities in response to the failure of the schooling system. However, “mobile learning” has its limitations. All the resources, opportunities, and every transition of this learning process is not institutionalized. “Mobile learning” relies largely on waiting, coincidences, the appreciation of supervisors and workers’ own extra labor (such as showing loyalty, hard work, diligence, etc.). In short, the path of migrant workers’ “mobile learning” is thin and easily ruptured.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1126734606325266422,19.1,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Forms of Ethics Review: Document, Meeting, and IRB Review Process",Ching-wen Hsu,"meeting, document, research ethics review committee, ethics review system, ethics review process","Through looking at university research ethics review committee meetings and examining the documents that frame as well as are produced by the meetings, this article aims to understand how the research ethics review committee translates ethics principles into procedures and rules that can be executed. Most of the literature on research ethics review tends to focus on structural issues of the ethics review system, contending principles of research ethics in different academic fields, and critiques of institutional overreach. Relatively less attention has been paid to the review process and the way ethics regulations are interpreted and applied. This article draws on personal experience as a committee member to describe the actual process through which research ethics review committees arrive at decisions on research applications. Research ethics review committees encompass routine administrative work and research project reviews. The ethics officers, who affirm proper application of administrative laws, and the review committee members, who are trained in specialist areas, work together to implement the abstract concepts of research ethics and execute regulations and laws. While there are differences across committees, research ethics review committees share common configurations and methods of reaching decisions to ensure consistency within individual committees as well as across local committees. During the review process, committee members become temporary bureaucrats for the purposes of decision-making. They actively and constantly interpret research ethics review procedures, rules, categories, and terms while filling in forms and assessing research protocols. Moreover, decisions regarding research applications are made collectively so that they are, or appear to be, beyond individual judgements. Bringing the committee together to discuss research application documents, routine Institutional Review Board (IRB) meetings are where the principles of protecting human research subjects and advancing academic knowledge are actively negotiated. Committee members assess the risk involved in a research project by reading the researcher’s application documents, deliberating on various scenarios to evaluate potential research-related harms, resolving disagreements, and reaching decisions as a group based on ethics principles as well as applicable rules. Therefore, IRB meetings are not only the mechanism that makes decisions on research proposals but also play a pivotal role in maintaining ethics guidelines and administrative laws, implementing and producing internal rules, establishing standard operational procedures (SOPs), and generating documents for the review system. The products of these meetings, that is, the meeting minutes, SOPs, and various documents, further frame how ethics reviews are conducted and the scope of the research ethics review. As the topics and methods of academic research are constantly evolving, the ethics review faces the possibility of research projects exceeding current rules, procedures, and categories. In order to accommodate more and more diverse research projects, meet review requirements, maintain consistency, and accomplish the goal of bureaucratic efficiency, review committees must consistently review and revise existing forms, procedures, and categories. Moreover, discussions and decisions made in meetings become precedents that are relied on to achieve consistent decisions. Through documents and meetings, ethics review committees align past precedents, current research, and future prospectuses, and articulate the diverse fields of international research ethics principles, state regulations, bureaucratic administration, and academic research.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1126734606325266422,19.1,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
Society and Its Structure: Rethinking Social Anthropology,Hsin-chieh Kao,"Society, Social Structure, Social Boundary, Social Organism, Social Continuity","This article aims to investigate the reasoning process which has made the study of social structure and the question of social continuity become an old-school research topic with little value and feasibility among social anthropologists. This process began with social anthropologists’ various ontological presuppositions, that is, how ‘Society’ is imagined, whether social life is, in essence, the continuous activities of living individuals or partial demonstrations of an out-of-sight, gigantic entity, how social anthropologists should describe and define such an object, etc.. Their ontological presuppositions have provided a set of answers for fundamental questions like ‘what is society?’ ‘what does society look like?’ ‘what kind of continuity would be necessary for such society?’ and ‘what kind of structure would be necessary for such continuity?’ In this reasoning process, however, central connotations of some key concepts used by social anthropologists have shifted from one property to another, which I call ‘accent shift.’ For example, the accent of the concept ‘realness’ has shifted from ‘permanent relations’ to ‘boundedness’, the accent of the concept ‘organicity’ has shifted from ‘mutual dependence’ to ‘part-whole relations,’ etc.. These accent shifts are hard to discern, but have implicitly changed the contents of ideas, including social realism, organic analogy, etc. Correspondingly, social anthropologists’ understanding of social life and its continuity has also been twisted. Consequently, the study of social structure has led to the theoretical dead alley of holism and mechanism. Rather than a literature review of anthropological theories of society, this article is an attempt to depict the routes of reasoning when theorists were conceiving their theories. In my opinion, many problems in social anthropology are nothing but a problem of bifurcation among various routes of reasoning. Social anthropologists might observe the same things from different angles, associate the same things with different kinds of relations, and focus on different points within the same concepts, discourses, and ideas. What really matters here is neither the qualities and quantities of empirical data nor the technical problem of ‘truth and its representation,’ i.e. some people did their fieldwork or wrote their ethnographies badly while others did not. It is rather a problem of social anthropologists’ own modes of thinking, their analytical tools and theoretical models which are applied to organize and rework their empirical data. But it should be recognized that those modes of thinking, analytical tools and theoretical models are not products of induction but gifts from devolution and inspiration. Even solid empirical data will not be able to correct mistakes existing in those modes, tools, and models if theorists have a belief in them and attribute the inconsistencies to the people who collected and used the data. In the end, the problem of modes of thinking has to be solved by means of logic, which makes this job look more like a kind of meta-anthropology, as this job can only be done by social anthropologists themselves.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1126734606325266422,19.1,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
My Walking in the Tayal Agro-Ecological Narratives: Corresponding with Tim Ingold,Yih-ren Lin,"traditional ecological knowledge, agro-ecology, walking, narratives, Tim Ingold, care","This paper is a reflective narrative depicting the characteristics and practices of the traditional agricultural ecological knowledge of the Tayal people who live in the hind mountains of Jienshi District, Hsinchu County. This paper also initiates a dialogue with anthropologist Tim Ingold’s discourse about walking based on his interpretations of the concepts of production, history, dwelling and lines, which I echo with my understanding of care from an ecological perspective. In contemporary society, Tayal people’s agricultural activities are greatly influenced by the modern market economy. Therefore, the operation of traditional household management is loosened and changed. However, through my fieldwork and action-oriented teaching courses in the university, I found that some elements from their traditional knowledge practices still exist and borrow a modern form to develop. This paper employs the methodology of narrative enquiry to highlight the importance of these elements. Furthermore, my research indicates that the core spirit of these traditional knowledge practices lies in recognizing ways to help others to grow. The paper is divided into five parts. The first part is an enquiry into the concept of “walking.” The second part uses the method of narrative to bring out the complementary relationship between walking and narrative.

"On Path, Walking, and Pathing: Village Paths in Yap and Yami",Yu-chien Huang,"path, pathing, agencing, Yap, Yami (Tao)","The idea of “path” or “pathways” is immensely critical to the people of Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and Oceania. It symbolizes indigenous historical consciousness, also figures as a metaphor of social ordering. My paper compares “village path[s]” between two Austronesian-speaking groups: the Yapese in Micronesia, and the Yami (Tao) off Eastern Taiwan. The Yapese culture is known for the robust form and various registers of hierarchy. The Yami (Tao) culture is known for its egalitarian features, embodied in the life course of the growing and dying house, which is analogized as the life-history of the founding/inhabiting couple. The concepts surrounding “path” therefore demonstrate a sharp contrast between the two cultures. I examine how “village path” signifies the social order in Yap and Yami in different ways, and then explicate path as landscape, as pathing/agencing, and as signifying practice[s]. I apply path/pathing as a new pathway to reconsider hierarchy/equality in the Austronesian-speaking peoples. I further suggest that contrasting different cultures’ concepts of “path/pathing” opens a route to investigate agencing (“the transformative and reflexive potential of ‘doing undergoing”), labor, temporality, forms of life, and the opens new possibilititesfor comparative studies, which advances anthropological knowledge.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1161507152067240304,19.2,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Good Seafood Harvest: Fishing Gear, Life-Death Mesh, and Embodied Skills in Taiwanese Aquaculture",Eric Siu-kei Cheng,"thing, embodied skill, mesh, attending, aquaculture","Taiwanese fish farmers must be familiar with various kinds of fishing gear in order to fulfil their goal of a good harvest. The Taiwanese aquaculture industry has developed many different types of equipment for different parts of the industry. This article presents field data collected from 2012 to illustrate how fish farmers, harvesting masters, and fish net makers use the gear. I analyze how things interweave to generate relationships between human and aquatic beings. I introduce the “Think Through Thing” methodology to reflect on three issues: 1) the formation of a “life-death mesh” during the making, using, and repairing of fish nets, 2) the political, economic, and social relationships derived from the design, use, and controversy of fishing gear, 3) the practice of embodied skills of using fishing gear in different parts of the aquaculture value chain. I develop my version of the methodology, “Thinking Through Gear,” by investigating how I attended various occasions of Taiwanese aquaculture and fishing villagers’ daily life. I thus engage in dialogue with theoretical discussions of multi-species ethnography, categories of embodied experience, and agro-food sector.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1161507152067240304,19.2,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"Fluid Volume Thinking and Politics of Air/Wind: Case of Dalinpu, Taiwan","Yi-ting Chang, Shiuh-shen Chien","air pollution, weather-world, fluid volume thinking, wind, body","Air pollution is an undeniable atmospheric phenomenon. Most publications about air pollution are concerned with human risk perception regarding pollution particles and energy transition in relation to the restructuring of the carbon economy. Less attention has been paid to the politics of air and wind on the one hand and the interactions between human and “three-dimensional, voluminous environment of air and wind” on the other hand. This paper aims to fill this gap. Inspired by Volume Geography scholars in general and environmental anthropologist Tim Ingold in particular, we argue that the politics of air pollution and wind needs to be understood in the context of the “weather-world” (the “comingling” of humans and the weather). Although wind as voluminous environment seems intangible, humans can still “feel” the wind via what we call “fluid volume thinking.” Three features of fluid volume thinking can be identified: (1) local experience and knowledge tends to be both bodily and intuitive, (2) people’s daily thinking includes spatial directionality, and (3) people’s daily life corresponds to the spatial and temporal “rhythm” of the mixture of sea, land and air. This kind of fluid volume thinking can explain how the temporal and spatial relationship between residents, the atmosphere, and factories is socially and politically constructed in the face of air pollution. Our theoretical framework is further empirically examined through the case of Dalinpu in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, a fenceline community surrounded by heavy industry factories where the first environmentalist movement successfully terminated an industrial zone project in the name of the preservation of wind.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1161507152067240304,19.2,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
The Development of Indigenous Cultural Knowledge in Higher Education: A Course Study of Multicultural Communication in Taiwan,"Tien-tai Wu, Ya-lin Chen","Culturally Sustaining System, Indigenous Education, Multicultural Communication, Mainstreaming Ethnicity, Indigenous Cultural Knowledge","Using Culturally Sustaining Pedagogy to think about how to design courses and develop curricula for indigenous education, this study examines the teaching and learning processes concerning indigenous cultural knowledge in a multicultural communication class. Through class observations and in-depth interviews in 2020 at National Dong Hwa University, we try to find the significant educational issues and multi-cultural learning systems which are related to the development of culturally sustaining systems and mainstreaming ethnicity. Based on the spirit of multi-cultural thinking and open dialogue between students and teachers, we emphasize learning from the perspective of indigenous peoples and form a support system which can transmit indigenous cultures through both formal education and traditional learning systems. Then we invite scholars and indigenous elders to discuss the course design and plan the curricula and teaching activities together. We integrate our disciplines by combining courses and forming related teaching issues which are not limited by the current disciplinary classifications. Working together with the tribe and the university, we shorten the distance between the traditional cultural transmission system and formal school education. Indigenous cultural powers are revitalized and the functions of university education are strengthened during the processes of teaching and learning. Step by step, we set up a culturally sustaining system that combines indigenous and university resources. By carrying on the traits of indigenous cultures holistically and through life-long learning, we try to fulfill the ideals of mainstreaming ethnicity in higher education.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?&SiteID=530164240637641451&MenuID=530167100636226027&MSID=1161507152067240304,19.2,2021,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
"An Ever-Extending Biography: “Field Photos” of the Indigenous Peoples in Taiwan from the 1950s to the 1960s in the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica",Wen-ling Lin,"Photo archive, Photographic image, Cultural biography of things, Taiwan Indigenous Peoples Studies, Academic institutionalization","From the 1950s to the 1960s, a survey team organized by the Institute of Ethnology of Academia Sinica visited nine ethnic groups of Taiwan’s Indigenous peoples, as well as the living areas of several Taiwanese Plains Indigenous peoples. During the field investigation process, their cameras recorded various activities and objects in the field. The survey work spanned about 10 years, and by 1965, a large number of field record images had been accumulated. The contents of this batch of field photos include: photo images of the villages visited (far, medium, and close), the natural environment around the tribe, local plants, people, rituals, material culture, buildings, statues, weaving looms and utensils, etc. If the contents of the images are viewed in accordance with the sequence in which the photos were taken, it is possible to grasp the movement traces and routes of the investigators at that time to a considerable extent. Although the black and white photos are old, they can still show the people, things and details that are brought into focus by the lens. These field photos have also been widely used in research papers and ethnographic publications, and have survived to this day. These photographs of field investigations spanning 10 years enrich and illustrate three-dimensionally the research results written in each text, assist the presentation of early studies of Indigenous peoples in Taiwan, and support research hypotheses and concepts. These field photos not only “recorded” the social and cultural outlook of Taiwan’s Indigenous people at that time, but also left field footprints and genealogical knowledge for early research on the Austronesian peoples in Taiwan. This article adopts the analysis framework of the photographic ecosystem to sort out the field photography archives of the Institute of Ethnology, Academia Sinica, from 1950 to 1960, and annotates three important nodes of the photos’ biography: (1) From the 1950s to the 1960s, photographic images were included in the monographs published by the Institute of Ethnology as research results, highlighting the social biographies of this batch of photo files. Here, photography has witnessed fieldwork on the ground, describing the interactions within fieldwork and the production process of scientific knowledge. The developed photos and images assist in the presentation of encyclopedic knowledge of subjects. (2) Archiving of physical photos taken in the 1950s and 1960s and subsequent digital files points out the material biographies of the photo files. The conversion from analog to digital material/interface makes the images more “freely” released from the photographs. These photo files that survive in the binary material world of 0 and 1 have more diversified possibilities for application and knowledge extension paths. (3) This batch of photographic images from 60 years ago, through the multiple possibilities of materials/interfaces, has moved into the field and ecosystem of academic publication in response to changing academic thinking, social actions or events. As photo archives move from one ecosystem to another, their use, value, and meaning, including the value of their biographies, have also changed. The scope or boundary of the aforementioned important identifiable nodes is distinguished, described and explained through specific examples and activities.

Becoming-with in a More-than-Human World: An Ethnographic Research on the “Insect-Fish-Flower-Bird” Markets in Beijing,I-yi Hsieh,"Beijing, Things, Market, Becoming, umwelt","This essay presents an ethnographic investigation into the “insectfish-flower-bird” markets in Beijing, based on fieldwork research conducted since 2012. Analyzing connoisseurs whose aesthetic practices engage with local collectors’ markets emergent in the process of urban renewal since the 1990s, I address how they negotiate a sense of locality by crafting a new selfhood alongside non-human beings in a time of rapid globalization. In the ethnography we encounter experiences in which the cultivation of selfhood and new sociality in a rapidly changing environment evolves in a process of people becoming along with beloved multispecies beings. Referencing multispecies ethnography and theorists such as Donna Haraway and Thom van Dooren, this article shows that the connoisseurs in Beijing manage to create an umwelt, an environment-world, which serves as a time capsule that brings back sensorial elements connecting them with the romanticism of nature once widely available in the everyday life of the hutong, where cohabitation with insects, fishes, flowers and birds—and thus the knowledge derived from such experience—were defining indexes for old Beijing identity. The rapid disappearance of the hutong residential form in the urban renewal process thus further points to how cohabitation with domestic nonhuman beings is fading into people’s fond memories about what city life once was. The ethnography focuses on the Shilihe market, located at the southeast corner of Beijing’s third-ring expressway, which has been touted since its establishment in 1996 as the largest “insect-fish-flower-bird” bazaar among many small ones in the city. By presenting a thick description of the connoisseurs involved in three sections in the Shilihe market – the teahouse, the literati walnut area, and the humming insect area – this essay shows the transformation of lives and livelihoods of many artisan-turned-connoisseurs in the age of market reform. Furthermore, this essay argues that the Shilihe case points to the great Chinese urban transformation in the age of market reform as a multispecies story. In this story, the seemingly peculiar aesthetic practices concerning non-human beings, which materialize qualia of the old Beijing milieu, recreate the umwelt once available in hutong and teahouse socializing as romanticization of the city’s imperial past. The collectors’ markets not only tell us about the nostalgia for old Beijing against a backdrop of globalization—thus illuminating the multiverse existent within a city—they also tell a story of profound precarity. The experiences of government-enforced relocation and eviction bring about a phenomenon in which a collective longing for the city’s past emerges, sustaining a sense of urgent need to revive and rescue local cultures. This permeating sentimentality urges many to search for an anchor of locality by cultivating intimacy with non-human beings. Many thus turn to the collectors’ markets. Given this dynamic of urban renewal defined by a mixture of precarity and nostalgia, the market reform allows a new kind of cultural heritage connoisseur to appear, capitalizing on the rise of collective longing for old Beijing by setting up shops in the “insect-fish-flower-bird” markets. This essay illustrates that the conversion of cultural capital by way of the new cultural industry of urban heritage presents anything but a smooth transition, shedding light on the uncertainty underlining the livelihoods of the connoisseurs by referencing the crisis theory of capital accumulation.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?SiteID=530164240637641451&MSID=1163232341620704633&MenuID=530167100636226027,20.1,2022,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology

Bourdieu and the Politics of Symbolic Violence,Ghassan Hage,,"In this lecture I examine the analytical work performed by the concept of ‘symbolic violence’ in Bourdieu’s theorisation of society as a mechanism for the production and distribution of, and the struggle over, being, or, to put it differently, the production and distribution of, and the struggle over, the viability of life. I show how Bourdieu’s key concepts constitute analytical angles on dimensions of this struggle for viability. Habitus highlights a conception of viability associated with practical efficiency: the more efficient one is, the more viable one’s life becomes. Illusio points to the viability that comes from having a life pursuit that makes life meaningful: it is the struggle to have a raison d’être that makes life valuable in our own eyes. Capital focuses on the viability derived from recognition: the sense of worthwhileness that comes when others validate the importance and significance of our life pursuits, our tastes, and our possessions. People’s struggles to augment their being is shaped by the kind of habitus, illusio and capital they inherit and for their capacity to invest their inheritances such as to yield an as satisfactory life as possible. The value of this inheritance, however, is crucially dependent on the social reality that valorizes it. One cannot inherit a valuable capacity to speak English in a world that is not an English-speaking reality. This is why the struggle to augment one’s being is always a struggle to keep reality on one’s side to maximize one’s complicity with reality. Symbolic power for Bourdieu is the power to create this complicity. Symbolic violence is a measure of the degree to which the dominant can naturalize this sense of complicity with reality such as to not only impose their reality but make others experience it as the only possible reality there is. The lecture examines what kinds of modes of domination and resistance such a degree of power entails.",https://www.ioe.sinica.edu.tw/Content/Periodicals/content.aspx?SiteID=530164240637641451&MSID=1163232341620704633&MenuID=530167100636226027,20.1,2022,Taiwan Journal of Anthropology
