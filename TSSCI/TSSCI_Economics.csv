"Panel VECM Approach to Examining Differences in Labour, Capital and Total Factor Productivity on Large Companies' Export Revenue and Export Intensity",Maja Bašić,"Total factor productivity, Labour productivity, Export, Export intensity, Vector error correction model (VECM), Impulse response function, Large companies","In order to answer how increases in total factor productivity, labour productivity and capital productivity affect equilibrium export growth and export intensity growth, a panel vector error correction model (VECM) is applied onto a firm level data of Croatia's 300 largest exporters in the period 2006-2015. Significance of this study is twofold. Firstly, VECM approach determines short and long run responses to shocks in total factor productivity, labour productivity and capital productivity. Results show that shocks in total factor productivity affects export growth but not export intensity growth. Labour productivity shocks do not affect export or export intensity growth, while capital productivity shocks have an effect on both export and export intensity, whereby the system takes longer to go back to equilibrium after capital productivity shocks than total productivity shocks. Secondly, managerial and policy implications of short-term and long-term effects of total factor productivity and labour productivity on export and export intensity growth are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-N202301090004-00001,50.4,2022,Academia Economic Papers
Firm and Export Heterogeneity in Export Growth: Evidence from China,"Chih-Hai Yang, Meng-Wen Tsou","Export growth, Foreign ownership, Export margins, Processing exports","This study examines the roles of firm characteristics and export heterogeneity in export growth. An analysis of the 2001-2007 firm-customs data set from China reveals that small and young firms exhibit higher export growth than large and mature firms. Conversely, foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), particularly joint ventures, exhibit a significantly lower export growth rate relative to private firms. Export type, market choice, and export variety are influential factors in export growth rate. A higher ratio of processing exports and a larger share of exports to advanced economies increase the growth rate of exports. Product variety and number of destinations are also positively associated with export growth. Considerable differences in the determinants of export growth exist between FIEs and domestic firms and between processing and ordinary export-oriented firms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-N202301090004-00002,50.4,2022,Academia Economic Papers
Preemption in a Linear City,Chia-Hung Sun,"Timing game, Preemption game, Location theory, Spatial discrimination","Based on Fudenberg and Tirole's (1985) preemption game, this study investigates both the theory of endogenous location and the timing of entry in a spatial discrimination model with a linear city. Two firms first decide when to enter the market and where to locate their respective plant and then compete in price or quantity in the product market at each instance. We find that the equilibrium involves sequential entry, with the leader locating at one endpoint and the follower locating in the interior of the linear city. The location differentiation in the Cournot model is increasing in transportation cost, whereas in the Bertrand model it is decreasing. The location differentiation and timing differentiation are both larger under Bertrand competition than under Cournot competition.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-N202301090004-00003,50.4,2022,Academia Economic Papers
"THE INTERNET, SLASH, AND WAGE",Wehn-Jyuan Tsai,"Internet, Labor supply, Slash, Wage, Wage inequality","An increase in overall Internet penetration is widely considered by policymakers as a viable way to combat poverty and close the urban-rural wage gap. Few studies, however, provide empirical evidence on the economic impact of the Internet. In this paper, we use the 1996-2005 sets of Family Income and Expenditure Survey to study the effects of the Internet on individual labor supply behavior and regional wage inequality. In an empirical model of labor supply, we use an Internet-enabled employee dummy and the density of local telephone subscribers twenty-nine years ago as instruments for the household Internet adoption variable. The empirical results suggest that the Internet does not have any statistical effect on individuals finding a job, whereas it indeed helps those employees developing multiple careers. In addition, our results show that the Internet might exacerbate regional wage inequality.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202209-202210070012-202210070012-287-323,50.3,2022,Academia Economic Papers
"ANTIDUMPING POLICY, EXPORTS, AND FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF TAIWAN",Chia-Ching Lin,"Antidumping, Exports, Foreign direct investment, Taiwanese firms","There is currently no comprehensive study of the impact of antidumping allegations on the exports of Taiwanese firms. This research focuses on 70 antidumping allegations involving companies listed in Taiwan, taking into consideration the role of foreign direct investment (FDI). The empirical analysis shows that, in general, antidumping allegations negatively influence the exports of the Taiwanese firms involved. Further, for companies engaged in FDI, such activities were favorable to their exports and helped mitigate the negative effects of the antidumping allegations. The favorable influence, however, does not exist if a firm chose Mainland China as their target country for investment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202209-202210070012-202210070012-325-356,50.3,2022,Academia Economic Papers
"ON-THE-JOB TRAINING SUBSIDY, WAGE INEQUALITY AND GROWTH IN A TWO-ENGINE GROWTH MODEL",Wei-Neng Wang,"On-the-job training subsidy, Wage inequality, Two engines of growth","This paper develops an endogenous growth model with two engines, R&D and capital with endogenous skill accumulation. Analytically, on-the-job training subsidies not only enhance the ratio of high-skilled to low-skilled workers, it also decreases wage inequality. The effects of on-the-job training subsidies on GDP growth, however, is ambiguous. The calibration results show that GDP growth exhibits an inverted U-shaped relationship with on-the-job training subsidies. That is, an increase in on-the-job training subsidies boosts overall growth and reduce wage inequality, provided that the status quo on-the-job training subsidies are moderate. Moreover, there exists a growth-maximizing subsidy rate, which decreases with the efficiency of skill accumulation, with the substitution elasticity between high-skilled and low-skilled workers in the capital-good sector, and with the depreciation rate of existing skills.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202209-202210070012-202210070012-357-401,50.3,2022,Academia Economic Papers

Focusing on the average and quantile treatment effects derived from difference-in-differences models, this study investigates how these heterogeneous labor welfare payment policies suppress wage growth.

THE IMPACT OF TAX INFORMATION EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS ON BROKEN LINKS IN OVERSEAS OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE OF TAIWAN'S MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,"Shinemay Chen, Wei-Min Hu, Cheng-Hsin Lin","Corporate ownership structure, Broken ownership links, Tax information exchange agreement, Double tax agreement, Tax haven","Due to the opacity of tax havens, multinational corporations (henceforth MNCs) have implemented harmful tax practices that erode the tax base of their home countries. To combat international tax avoidance and profit shifting, the OECD has promoted tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) since 2000. In 2012, OECD also mandated that countries or regions on the tax haven blacklist must sign at least 12 bilateral agreements on the exchange of information that meet the OECD transparency standard. The increased information sharing between tax authorities makes it more difficult for multinationals to shift profits offshore to avoid taxes; tax havens, therefore, are losing their charm. Whether the expansion of the TIEAs network will delink tax havens from MNCs' ownership structure is unclear. To explore this question, this paper uses TEJ's financial data to examine how the Tax Information Exchange and Tax Havens mechanism affects multinational corporations' shareholding structure. The results show that the number of delinks related to tax havens is relatively high, and the expansion of the TIEA network negatively impacts delinks. In addition, when tax havens sign more TIEAs with other countries or regions, delinks increase.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202206-202207050019-202207050019-199-239,50.2,2022,Academia Economic Papers
THE EXTENT OF IMPLICIT TAX AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL AND TAX REFORM,"Jenn-Shyong Kuo, Tsan-Yu Wu, Yilien Han, Yen-Ju Chen","Implicit tax, Tax reform, Statute for industrial innovation, Tax preference","This study explores whether Taiwan's Tax Reform Act of 2010 (TRA2010) affected implicit corporate taxes. The literature mostly uses explicit taxes paid to the government to measure tax burden, whereas the implicit tax, the reduced pre-tax rate of return for enterprises enjoying tax preferences, is often neglected. Applying both direct and indirect methods, this study uses data from TSEC- and OTC-listed companies from 1999 to 2017. Several results emerge: first, pre-tax rate of return is positively related to effective tax rates, indicating that tax preferences induce the implicit tax; second, the implicit tax decreased across industries, especially for high-tech industries, after TRA2010; third, under the direct method, the implicit tax of traditional industries does not show significant difference after TRA2010; and fourth, under the direct method, the implicit tax of high-tech industries is significantly higher than that of traditional industries. Taken together, the results demonstrate that high-tech corporations enjoyed more tax preferences before TRA2010, and that the differences in the implicit tax between the two industries narrowed after TRA2010. Hence, the purpose of TRA2010, to decrease variation in tax preferences across industries, was achieved.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202206-202207050019-202207050019-241-285,50.2,2022,Academia Economic Papers
Effects of a Per-Bag Trash Collection Fee Program: Evidence from a Synthetic Control Method,"Frank Yao Huang, Po-Chun Huang","Per-bag trash collection fee, Synthetic control method, Waste avoidance, Waste substitution","Pay As You Throw (PAYT) policies are implemented worldwide to reduce waste. This paper estimates the effects of a PAYT policy in New Taipei City-per-bag trash collection fee (PBCF) program-on households' waste disposal. Under the PBCF, people have to buy certified bags for their unsorted waste, while sorted waste (food and recyclable waste) is disposed of for free. We apply a synthetic control method that allows cities/counties to have different trends in waste disposal. The estimation results using the city/county-level administrative data suggest that the PBCF decreases unsorted waste by about 27.2% and recyclable waste by about 20.8%. Food waste almost doubles in the short term, but the magnitude gradually reduces over time. Overall, the program reduces total waste by about 17.4%. These results suggest that waste avoidance behavior resulting from the PBCF appears not only in unsorted waste but also in recycling. Finally, we estimate that the welfare gain from the PBCF is about 30,000 NTD per household per year.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202203-202204010021-202204010021-1-39,50.1,2022,Academia Economic Papers
The Effect of Risk Information on Housing Prices in Taiwan,"Tzu-Chang Forrest Cheng, Tai-Chi Wang, Jian-Da Zhu","Information disclosure, Risk perception, Housing market, Soil liquefaction risk","This research uses a difference-in-differences framework to investigate the effect of new risk information on housing prices in Taiwan. The results show that this information changed individuals' subjective risk perceptions, so that housing prices in the highest-risk areas dropped, but only temporarily in the first three months after the disclosure. This information effect happened for those apartments lacking certain earthquake-resistant characteristics. In addition, we investigate the dynamics of the effect around the boundary. We demonstrate that individuals were able to form continuous risk beliefs based on discrete information, and the housing prices dropped more sharply for apartments located closer to the center of the highest-risk area. Furthermore, individuals had updated their risk beliefs differently for apartments with different levels of earthquake resistance. For apartments with the least earthquake resistance, the immediate price drops were larger, and the housing prices returned to normal more slowly, relative to the safer apartments. Most notably, the effect did not disappear at all for those apartments with the least earthquake resistance that were also located in the center of the highest-risk area.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202203-202204010021-202204010021-41-73,50.1,2022,Academia Economic Papers
HOW SUPPLY-SIDE FACTORS AFFECT COLLEGE DROPOUTS: THE EFFECTS OF COLLEGIATE RESOURCES AND ADMISSION QUOTAS ALLOCATION ON DROPOUTS,Mateus Lee,"Student-faculty ratios, Collegiate resources, Return ratios, Admission quota, Dismissal policy, College dropouts","This study investigates how supply-side factors - collegiate resources and admission quotas allocation - affect college dropouts. Estimation is based on department-level institutional and admission data from 68 Taiwanese public and private colleges from academic year 2016 to 2019. Controlling for school and department fixed effects, inappropriate multi-channel admission quotas allocation reduces the minimum admission score on the Advanced Subjects Test (AST) and leads to the recruitment of students with unexpectedly low AST scores. It also increases both dropouts based on incompatible interest at public colleges and dropouts based on academic performance at private colleges. Moreover, lower collegiate resources and higher final AST admission quotas lead to larger dropouts based on incompatible interest at private colleges. Policy implications regarding the admission quotas allocation are suggested.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202203-202204010021-202204010021-75-115,50.1,2022,Academia Economic Papers
OUTWARD FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT AND LABOR SHARES: EVIDENCE FROM TAIWANESE MANUFACTURING FIRMS,"Chih-Hai Yang, Yi-Tung Liu, Meng-Wen Tsou","Labor share, Outward foreign direct investment, Technological progress","Using Taiwanese data on manufacturing firms during 2002-2018, this study examines the impact of outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) on labor shares. Controlling for firm fixed effects, the labor share is lower for a firm undertaking OFDI versus firms that do not. This effect is, however, driven mainly by firms’ investing in China rather than in other countries. In addition, firms with more exports, higher export intensity, and higher productivity tend to have lower labor shares. Considering the potential endogeneity of OFDI, we adopt propensity score matching (PSM) for multiple treatments PSM. Results show that, relative to firms that did not engage in OFDI, firms that invest in China and other areas have the lowest labor shares (a reduction of 37%-39%), followed by firms investing only in China (a reduction of 20%-22%), and firms investing in other areas only have little differences in labor shares.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202203-202204010021-202204010021-117-154,50.1,2022,Academia Economic Papers

THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY POLICY OVER BUSINESS CYCLES IN TAIWAN,Yu-Hsiang Hsiao,"Monetary policy, Business cycle, Impulse response","This paper investigates the asymmetric impact of monetary policy over business cycles in Taiwan. Employing Romer and Romer's (2004) identification approach, we construct a new measure of monetary policy shocks for Taiwan's economy. Estimated by the new measure, the finding suggests that the impact of monetary policy is larger and the transmission speed is faster than with a short-term restriction approach. Moreover, the impact of monetary policy on output, employment, and real bank loans are less effective in recessions than in expansions. Furthermore, private consumption and investment are less responsive to monetary policy in recessions than in expansions, and government consumption has no significant response in either state.

THE INFORMATION CONTENT OF THE PRE-OPENING LIMIT ORDER BOOK: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF TRANSPARENCY REFORM AT THE OPENING CALL,Yi-Heng Tseng,"Taiwan stock exchange, Limit order book, Pre-opening quotes and depths, Individual investor, Institutional investor","The adoption of the pre-open disclosure mechanism in June 29, 2015 has made the limit order book (LOB) highly transparent during the opening call. Our study finds that, after this reform, though the close-to-open return volatility becomes higher, the weighted price contribution (WPC) at the opening call still increases and the opening prices are less manipulated in large cap stocks. Although the price discovery efficiency declines most of the time during the opening call, the poor quality of pre-opening quotes and depths disclosed in the LOB has greatly improved since 8:55. Moreover, the reference prices and best 'unexecuted' quotes along with depths are highly related to the changes in equilibrium prices. For large cap stocks, the information content in the 4^(th) and 5^(th) best quotes emerges in the last five minutes of the opening call. This transparency reform also raises the probability of individual and institutional investors submitting aggressive orders. The sensitivity of order aggressiveness to the bid-ask spread variation is significantly different during the half hour before and after the market opening, implying that both types of investors have less confidence in the pre-opening quotes and depths.

As the Survey was conducted at the household level, we used the National Transfer Account (NTA) method to decompose household educational expenditures into personal expenditures. Our results suggest that Taiwanese families increased their educational spending for children in junior high school or below. In contrast, educational spending for children in senior high school first increased and then decreased. There was a significant drop since 2011. We found that parents' educational attainment and income positively correlate with academic expenditures on children, but parents' age and the number of household members have opposite effects. We also found that household's educational spending responded to the varying admission rates of high schools and universities. Families also increased their educational expenditures when returns to higher education increase. This paper further compares the educational expenditure decisions among households with different income levels. Our results show that while households of all income levels value educational investment in children, families of varying income levels have divergent trends in their educational expenditures.

The intergenerational income elasticity is estimated for both paternal and maternal families, where the age of children is restricted to the period when their observed income is close to their permanent income. The estimated father-child income elasticity is 0.249-0.332. Controlling for the income of the father and paternal grandparents, the father-child income elasticity falls to 0.222-0.310. The grandparents-child income elasticity is 0.249-0.561, and the mother-child income elasticity is 0.208-0.269. Controlling for the income of the mother and maternal grandparents, the mother-child income elasticity rises to 0.235-0.276. The maternal grandparents-child income elasticity is, however, statistically insignificant.

To increase the demand for insurance, this paper proposes a new tool of government intervention: an insurance-linked lotto. The proposed lotto is independent of the occurrence of the insurable risk, but the probability of winning the prize or the prize itself is positively correlated with the insurance coverage. We show that when an individual's preferences are characterized by rank dependent expected utility, the insurance-linked lotto could enhance the equilibrium demand for insurance and improve individual welfare as well.

Specifically, we focus on the relationships among a property's market value, its assessed value, and the owner's income and wealth. Our results show that Taiwan's property tax system consistently undervalues real estate. The gap between assessed value and market value is especially prominent among high-value properties. As a result, while the assessment-sales ratio is weakly progressive regarding income, it is severely regressive regarding wealth. In addition, since this regressiveness is not evident for financial and other non-property assets, the property tax system provides incentives for people to concentrate their assets on real estate.

Based on the fertility stopping rule, the paper defines girls whose parents' preference is for a son and boys whose parents' preference is for a daughter. The results indicate that the parents' gender preference has no effect on high school outcomes of children, because the opportunity to enter high school is close to 100%. However, this gender preference significantly affects children's choice of field of study. For senior high school students, both the effect of girls' parental preference for a son and the effect of boys' parental preference for a daughter on the choice of ＂social science program＂ are positive. For vocational high school students, girls whose parents prefer a son are more likely to choose women-stereotyped fields of study, while boys whose parents prefer a daughter are less likely to choose women-stereotyped fields of study.

Within several years, China swiftly dominated the global solar energy production market. However, Chinese firms' predatory pricing provoked retaliation from the U.S. and the EU with ＂anti-dumping＂ and ＂countervailing＂ investigations beginning in 2011. This paper constructed a firm-level panel dataset and measured the extent of resource misallocation prevalent in the Chinese solar industry between 2009 and 2014. Our results suggested that although substantial resource misallocation existed in 2009 and 2010, the Chinese solar industry's misallocation had improved afterward. This occurred mainly because of the improvement in output distortion patterns among Chinese firms. However, through our decomposition exercise, we found that capital distortions played a more critical role in explaining the Chinese solar industry's production loss. This suggested that to advance its solar energy industry further, focusing on curtailing capital distortions should be the Chinese government's priority.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202106-202107130014-202107130014-245-283,49.2,2021,Academia Economic Papers
THE LIFETIME EARNINGS ACROSS COHORTS IN TAIWAN,Pi-Fem Hsu,"Lifetime earnings, Cohort effect, Mixed model, Initial conditions","The study adopts the Panel Study of Family Dynamics database which comprises 20-year longitudinal surveys to examine cohort differences by estimating the heterogeneous lifetime earnings among individuals. The random effects of the mixed model are used to distinguish which portion of lifetime earnings was due to the remuneration of initial conditions and which part was due to age-earning profile. H H Empirical results show that the remuneration for initial conditions declined over cohorts. If men born in the 1981-1990 cohort possess high school, college, or university education, respectively, then their remuneration for initial conditions compared with men born before the 1960 cohort will be reduced by 34%, 32%, and 50%, respectively. In the past 20-year surveyed period, no evidence shows that an individual's cohort would cause earnings to grow heterogeneously. Regardless of any cohort, an individual's extra (or discounted) remuneration for initial conditions would affect the growth of lifetime earnings. Those with superior (or inferior) unobserved abilities would have higher (or lower) remuneration for initial conditions, which also increases (or reduces) the growth of lifetime earnings.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202106-202107130014-202107130014-285-319,49.2,2021,Academia Economic Papers
Does Taiwan Need a Macro-Prudential Policy? How to Do It? How to Coordinate with Monetary Policy?,Po-Yuan Wang,"Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium, DSGE-VAR, Monetary policy, Macro-prudential policy, Welfare analysis","This paper develops a small open economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with collateral constraints. We estimate the model with data in Taiwan using the Bayesian technique, and assess the fit of the model by the DSGE-vector autoregression (DSGE-VAR) methodology. We demonstrate the welfare implications of the monetary policy and the macro-prudential policy. Our results suggest that an interest rate rule optimally responding to the growth of housing prices or domestic loans could enhance social welfare and make all agents better off. Introducing an optimal loan-to-value (LTV) ratio rule in response to domestic credit or housing price dynamics is also Pareto improving. Furthermore, the optimal deployment of both the monetary and macro-prudential policy could yield more social welfare. The coordination of policies effectively stabilizes the financial system and limits the volatility of inflation.

The results show that, first, the rating standard has tightened from 2008 to 2014, but loosened from 2015 to 2018. Second, the specific regime and environment in China affect credit rating determinants. Bonds with implicit or explicit guarantees are assigned better ratings. Firms with high audit quality are also assigned better ratings. Third, ratings can predict default probabilities and explain bond yield spreads.

THE MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY,Wei-Neng Wang,"Corporate social responsibility, Corporate value, Social welfare","This paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium model to analyze the macroeconomic and welfare effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Analytically, this paper shows that the effects of CSR on consumption, corporate value, and social welfare are ambiguous. The calibration results show that the steady-state corporate value and social welfare exhibit inverted U-shaped relationships with CSR. Moreover, an increase in CSR can result in a double dividend in terms of enhancing both corporate value and social welfare, provided that the status quo CSR expenditure is moderate. Also, the corporate-value-maximizing CSR expenditure is lower than the welfare-maximizing CSR expenditure. From a policy implication's point of view, this paper demonstrates that although an increase in the tax-deductible ratio of CSR expenditure can improve social welfare, it will also distance the state from a welfare-maximizing scenario.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202103-202104130021-202104130021-121-162,49.1,2021,Academia Economic Papers

Previous studies find that a merger in this setting tends to be welfare-reducing if the merged firm exits the upstream market and the downstream goods are highly differentiated. The reason is that a reduction in the number of upstream suppliers raises the input price and lowers downstream production. This paper departs from previous studies by considering the case in which the merged firm continues to trade in the upstream market. A vertical merger is always procompetitive with this assumption change because, in this case, the merged firm sells inputs in the upstream market if the downstream goods are sufficiently differentiated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202012-202101130018-202101130018-445-473,48.4,2020,Academia Economic Papers

The study focuses on how firms ＂control＂ the cost and expense to minimize their tax burden. To simplify the analysis, we investigate whether there is a significant difference in salary expenditure between the firms which file their tax returns under a unique corporate tax audit policy and those do not. We use the corporate tax return data and income registry data from the Fiscal Information Agency between 2004 and 2014.

While most existing studies examine this relationship using a linear model, this paper adopts a non-linear threshold model to identify whether there exists any tax-burden threshold effect for this relationship in Taiwan. We find that there is a threshold effect for the rate of tax burden in this relationship, which is equal to 19.657%. If the rate of tax burden is less than 19.657%, then an increase in the rate of tax burden significantly decreases SE. By contrast, if the rate of tax burden is greater than 19.657%, then a further increase in this rate leads to an increase in SE. In addition, we present results showing that the threshold model outperforms the linear model in terms of in-sample fits, and that the relationship between the tax burden and SE, whether above or below the former's threshold level, is quite robust with respect to different estimation methods for SE.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202012-202101130018-202101130018-511-555,48.4,2020,Academia Economic Papers

In view of this, this paper explores two solutions: the efficiency solution and political equilibrium solution. According to our research, based on the fact that only the high-type taxpayers will buy indivisible goods, (1) the commodity tax on the indivisible goods acts as differential lump-sum taxes, which leads to the conclusion that the optimal commodity tax on the indivisible goods should be given priority for taxation under the premise that high-ability taxpayers will still be willing to purchase indivisible goods. The tax rate of indivisible goods is positive; (2) high-ability taxpayers hope the tax on indivisible goods could be much lighter, while the low-ability taxpayers hope the tax on indivisible goods could be much heavier. This result reveals that the tax rate on indivisible goods in the political equilibrium will be lower than the one in the optimal commodity taxation.

The benefits of exploiting extant cost-based competence are found to erode; gaining new competitiveness, such as high-quality competence, at the appropriate time is thus an inevitable challenge. Because of the preemptive effect of forerunners, the industrial adjustment of adopting the leap strategy is gradual, and heterogeneity may arise in equilibrium. We determined the equilibrium diffusion of the adoption of this strategy and examined the effects of exogenous changes on this diffusion. Specifically, we herein show that reductions in the barriers to market entry and improvement in cost efficiency result in tougher competition and reduce the probability that a firm will adopt the leap strategy. By contrast, changes helpful to exploring quality-based competence, such as a decrease in the fixed cost of adoption or market integration during the diffusion period, can expedite a leap and may persuade more high-quality players to join in. This model makes a theoretical contribution that informs latecomer strategies, the design of development policies, and the effects of market integration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202009-202010140014-202010140014-413-444,48.3,2020,Academia Economic Papers
On the Efficiency Aspect of Inheritance Taxation,"C. Y. Cyrus Chu, Chun-Hui Lu, C. C. Yang","Inheritance tax, Resource misallocation, Efficiency","Bequest by definition is what a child receives from her deceased parent. This fact implies that returns to bequeathed capital may vary substantially across children if the capital market is not perfect. Previous studies on inheritance tax such as Piketty and Saez (2013), however, are mostly built on the perfect-capital-market premise under which bequeathed capital all receives a common rate of return. Theoretically, this paper identifies inheritance tax as a device for increasing TFP (total factor productivity) by correcting the possibly inefficient misallocation of bequeathed capital. Numerically, calibrating the U.S. economy suggests that it is optimal to significantly increase the progressivity of the inheritance tax from the current level, which contributes to a steady-state 6.29% increase in TFP.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-202006-202007030021-202007030021-151-181,48.2,2020,Academia Economic Papers

By focusing on the influences of vertical differentiation and inelastic demand, we show that a specific tax is superior to an ad valorem tax in the short run, when the marginal cost of the high-quality product is relatively low or is relatively high and the ad valorem tax rate is high. We also show that a specific tax may not only be welfare superior to, but may also Pareto dominate an ad valorem tax in the long run, when the ad valorem tax rate is high. These two results imply that the government should impose a specific tax on products with price-inelastic demand if the tax revenue requirement is high.

This paper analyzes the choice of commodity tax base by world welfare in an asymmetric model. It is found that the origin tax principle is superior to the destination tax principle in terms of world welfare for the case of large differences in product quality. As the degree of quality differentiation shrinks, world welfare is higher under the origin tax principle when the trade cost is low; world welfare is higher under the destination tax principle when the trade cost is high. In addition, when product quality differences are smaller, world welfare is higher under the destination tax principle.

ECONOMIC GROWTH AND SOCIAL WELFARE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF FINANCING A RETIREMENT PENSION,Chi-Ting Chin,"Retirement pension, Premium financing, Tax financing, Endogenous growth, Social welfare","Based on the growth and welfare effects of a retirement pension, this paper analyzes the pros and cons (by the lifetime risk) between premium financing or tax financing. Several main findings are concluded as follows. First, both premium financing and tax financing reduce the balanced growth rate, and tax financing reduces economic growth rate more than does premium financing. Second, a retirement pension reduces the welfare of the younger and raises that of the older. To finance from premiums, the welfare loss of the younger is lower than the welfare gains of the older; but to finance from taxation, the welfare loss of the younger may be higher than the welfare gains of the older. Relative to premium financing, tax financing has larger bad effect on welfare of all generations. Finally, there are some research limitations in the theoretical estimation model, which leads to some estimation errors between the theoretical estimation and the actual data on the employed population and the tax payable in each age group.

The application of governance mechanisms may be detrimental to firm value when the firm grows at a fast rate. The optimal governance mechanism is more intensive when external financing is allowed.

THE EFFECT OF CULTIVATING ART AND TALENT SKILL ON COLLEGE OUTCOMES: EVIDENCE FROM TAIWAN YOUTH PROJECT,Chia-Hua Liu,"Skills, Cultivating art and talent skill, Educational attainment, National colleges, Elite national colleges","With the expansion of higher education, the public attention on educational attainment has shifted from entering college to entering a good college. The implementation of the multi-channel admission program raises the impact of non-test scores on college outcomes. Using the Taiwan Youth Project, this paper examines determinants of cultivating art and talent skill (cultivating skill), and effects of cultivating skill on college outcomes. In analyzing determinants of cultivating skill, the paper finds that basic competence test scores (BCT scores) are negatively correlated with cultivating sport-and-dance-related skills, and positively correlated with cultivating writing-and-speech-related skills. These findings suggest that the relationship between cognitive ability and sport-and-dance-related skills is substitutional, while the relationship between cognitive ability and writing-and-speech-related skills is complementary. Moreover, after controlling for inherent talent and other characteristics, results indicate that cultivating skills and BCT scores both are positively correlated with entering a good college. Among all skills, the positive correlation between writing-and-speech-related skills and entering a good college is the clearest. Furthermore, the interaction between cultivating skills and BCT scores is positively related to entering a good college, which implies that students who have both decent art and talent performance and good BCT scores may get a better result under the multi-channel admission program.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201912-201912300022-201912300022-571-611,47.4,2019,Academia Economic Papers
AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF WIDENING DAILY PRICE LIMIT AND EXTENDING THE CLOSING CALL,Yi-Heng Tseng,"Taiwan stock exchange, Price limit, Order aggressiveness, Order performance, Trading halt","This study employs intra-day data to investigate how the reform of widening the daily price limit to ±10% on 1 June 2015 affects order choices along with performance.

This is referred to as antidumping-jumping FDI. Currently, Taiwan is the country with the highest frequency of receiving dumping accusations in the world. However, there are currently no empirical research papers on the behavior of antidumping-jumping FDI. Focusing on the antidumping lawsuits against Taiwan during the period of 1987-2014, this research covers 13 countries that have filed antidumping lawsuits against Taiwan, 70 cases and 228 companies. Event history analysis is adopted for this paper. The empirical results show that antidumping lawsuits stimulate companies to implement antidumping-jumping FDI.

The results show that this relationship depends on the probability of liquidity shock. When the probability of liquidity shock is low, the banks invest only in long-term risky loans, and then the bank liquidity risk and credit risk are positively correlated; however, when the probability is high, they are inclined to hold long-term risky loans and full liquidity reserves, and then the bank liquidity risk and credit risk are uncorrelated. Moreover, more loan market competition and higher deposit rates increase both bank liquidity risk and credit risk. Both the bank liquidity risk and credit risk are decreasing in adequate capital requirements when imposing capital regulation that requires the banks to use equity capital.

Our empirical results consistently indicate that D&O insurance is negatively associated with tax avoidance activities. In other words, D&O insurance will enhance the effectiveness of corporate governance, and prevent the management from engaging in tax avoidance activities. Moreover, we also find that D&O insurance coverage is negatively associated with firms' tax avoidance activities. However, our further tests find a positive relationship between abnormal D&O insurance coverage and tax avoidance activities, indicating that the abnormal D&O insurance coverage will induce moral hazard and lead to more aggressive tax avoidance activities.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201909-201910010013-201910010013-485-524,47.3,2019,Academia Economic Papers

This paper constructs a small open, two-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to study the macroeconomic effects of tourism receipt fluctuations. It finds that the decline of tourism receipts has a negative effect on total output. In particular, the tourism sector experiences severe declines in output, labor, and investment. When the elasticity of substitution between labor of tourism and other sectors is high, the negative macroeconomic effects can be mitigated. We also investigate the effect of the tourist subsidy policy. Although the subsidy helps reduce the output decline in the tourism sector, the debt-financed subsidy deteriorates the fiscal position; the required fiscal adjustment - cutting government spending or raising taxes - in turn has negative effects on the overall economy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201906-201906280006-201906280006-163-207,47.2,2019,Academia Economic Papers

The motivation of for re-dating is because the current crisis dates are either incorrect or incomplete, making early warning signals tend to be incorrect. We re-check the details of the three types of financial crisis dates in Taiwan during the period 1983 to 2016. Our results find that there are six banking crises in Taiwan, which occurred in 1985, 1995 to 1996, 1998, 2000 to 2001, 2007, and 2008. One currency crisis occurred in 1997 to 1998 and there were no debt crises over this period in Taiwan. Then, we build an early warning econometric model to examine whether our bank crisis dating outperforms the dating in the literature. We consider four different banking crisis dating samples: Caprio and Klingebiel (2003), Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Laeven and Valencia (2013) and ours.

In our work, we use the standard deviation and semi-deviation of returns on equity as the proxies for insurers' total risk and downside risk respectively. Results show that derivatives participants tend to have lower values in these risk measurements. However, insurers that use more derivatives have higher risk. One of the possible explanations is that the excessive amount of derivatives use could make insurers' income flows more volatile and thus increase insurers' risk. On the other hand, the volume of reinsurance usage is related to higher insurers' risk.

We use three unique types (Form A, Form B, and Form C) of coverage for vehicle damage insurance data in Taiwan. We first identify the basic characteristics of policyholders and vehicles which are currently applied by insurers for property damage to vehicles. We further investigate some supplementary information, which requires small information cost for the insurers to obtain from the insureds. Our evidence shows that, for the crucial risk classification based on the current official rating formula, claim coefficient is a relatively critical factor for Form A, while claim coefficient and car age are important for Form B, and policyholder age is important for Form C. We also find that some additional information such as the claim record in the previous policy year provides useful information for risk classification. Our findings imply that the official rating formula may consider various risk factors among different types of coverage for damage to vehicles. In fact, insurers could improve claim prediction by adding unused information such as the claim record in the previous policy year or other factors. Thus, the deregulation of automobile insurance rating can benefit from an efficient risk classification.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201906-201906280006-201906280006-297-338,47.2,2019,Academia Economic Papers

However, the effectiveness of such policy becomes doubtful when the nominal interest rate is close to the zero lower bound. This paper applies Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to estimate a Bayesian time-varying parameter vector autoregression model and attempts to evaluate the effectiveness of Japanese monetary policies through the interest rate channel in recent years. The main empirical findings of the paper are as follows. First, the effects of monetary policy through the interest rate channel show time-varying effects between 1975 and 2015 in Japan. Second, the shock of a decreasing interest rate has little positive effect on production and the unemployment rate. These findings are supported by the view that it is difficult for the quantitative easing policy in recent years to stimulate the economy through the interest rate channel.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201903-201903290013-201903290013-31-73,47.1,2019,Academia Economic Papers

This paper further expands to a three-equation simultaneous model, allowing for exploring the nexus among NIM, NonII, and profit stability (measured by the Z-score) for Taiwan's 47 commercial banks spanning the period 2001-2014. The empirical results show that banks with higher NonII have less profit stability, which corresponds to the ＂moral hazard＂ hypothesis. Banks with lower profit stability (Z-score) not only need higher NIM, but also require involvement in more off-balance-sheet activities to earn higher non-interest income.

BRS also mention the possibility of non-monotonicity. However, the decrease in magnification effect accompanies the decrease in industrial productivity and the result that all firms export, which does not coincide with empirical findings.

A QUANTITATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE CAUSES OF TAIWAN'S WAGE STAGNATION,Shu-Shiuan Lu,"Neoclassical, Labor market, Wages, Taiwan","Wage stagnation between 2000-2012 is unprecedented in Taiwan's development in the past 60 years. This phenomenon is puzzling, as the growth rate of average labor productivity remains above 2.5%, while there is almost no growth in real wages. In this paper, a simple arithmetic computation and a neoclassical measuring approach - business cycle wedge methodology - are adopted to explore the possible causes of such a growth difference in average labor productivity and real wages. Moreover, we address why wages grow much more slowly than in the previous twenty years. It turns out that the use of different deflators for deflating average labor productivity (i.e., real gross domestic product per worker) and real wages accounts for about 80% of the gap. Furthermore, there are two reasons for why the wages during 2000-2012 grew more slowly than the preceding period, i.e., 1980-2000: (1) the fall in total factor productivity in the early 2000s and then the increasing capital market friction caused the growth rate of the marginal product of labor to fall; (2) the fall of the markup of wages paid over the marginal product of labor caused the slow growth in wages paid. All the above factors lead to the observed wage stagnation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201812-201812240012-201812240012-519-553,46.4,2018,Academia Economic Papers

Our results reveal that there is a significant genuine effect of openness on growth. This effect depends on the type of data, openness indicators, and countries of the articles used. For example, the impact of openness on growth is higher in the African countries, which implies that the trade policy is far more important in poor countries. We also find evidence of problems of heterogeneity and publication bias in the literature. The resulting meta-regression results show that the studies considered are different with respect to the openness indicator used, the type of data, the number of countries, and the sample of countries.

THE NON-MONOTONIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TRADE LIBERALIZATION AND INCOME INEQUALITY,Tsechien Hsu,"International trade, Income inequality, Heterogeneous producers, Frictions in the borrowing and lending market, Intra-industry trade","At the end of the twentieth century, many economists believe that trade is not the main reason causing income inequality within countries, because several empirical studies have found that the pattern of the rise in inequality does not coincide with the prediction of the Heckscher-Ohlin model. However, many recent studies, especially those based on firm heterogeneity, rediscover the theoretical basis and empirical evidence to support the relationship between the two. Based on the friction in the borrowing market, the difference between the capital endowment and the endogeneity of the demand elasticity, this paper generates the non-monotonic relationship between the inequality and trade liberalization. Based on firm heterogeneity, some studies predict the existence of a monotonic relationship, but others show a non-monotonic feature, although the mechanism is different from this paper.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201812-201812240012-201812240012-597-636,46.4,2018,Academia Economic Papers

By contrast, short selling activities due to institutional investors have two opposite effects on mispricing: an information effect, which predicts a negative effect on subsequent stock returns and a price correction effect, which predicts a positive effect; the net effect will be negative if the former dominates the latter.

Real-time data of inflation forecasts and the output forecast are used, and the inverse quantile regressions are applied to deal with endogeneity of exchange rate variables. We find the policy reaction parameters systematically deviate from the estimates of the conditional mean over the conditional interest rate distribution. In particular, the interest rate smoothing parameter will be higher in the upper part than in the lower part of the conditional distribution of the interest rate. Furthermore, the central bank prefers an anti-recession policy for the current output gap and an anticyclical policy for future output gaps. The central bank's anti-recession preference for the current output gap not only may cause asymmetric interest rate inertia, but also leads to diverse and conditional interventions on the nominal exchange rate.

A Performance Evaluation of Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance: An Application of the Economic Index of Riskiness,"Richard Lu, Ling-Yu Hsiung","Constant proportion portfolio insurance, Economic index of riskiness, Economic performance measurement","The investment performance of constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) strategies is evaluated by using the economic performance measure (EPM). This performance measure generalizes the Sharpe measure by replacing the standard deviation with the economic index of riskiness proposed by Aumann and Serrano (2008). For the performance evaluation, the return distributions are generated by Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that whether the CPPI strategies can outperform a buy-and-hold (BH) strategy depends on the level of the multiplier, the performance measure, and the market scenario. The multiplier is the most important factor that determines whether CPPI can outperform BH. When the multiplier is no more than two, CPPI almost always outperforms BH under the normal return and volatility market. However, if the multiplier is five, which is a commonly used value in applications, CPPI is outperformed by BH under all market scenarios studied.

However, that for male workers mostly results from the discrimination that comes with the unorthodox nature of temporary contracts.

DECOUPLING OF WAGE GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN TAIWAN: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION,"Yi-Ling Lin, Tzu-Ting Yang","Wage, Labr productivity, Terms of trade","One of the most puzzling facts about Taiwan's economy in the past 15 years is that the growth of the real wage rate has fallen far behind the growth of labor productivity (real GDP par hour worked). Many previous studies have suggested this phenomenon could be due to the decline in the share of lobar compensation. We examine this issue empirically by decomposing the growth gap between the real wage rate and labor productivity into the growth of three components: share of labor compensation, wage to labor compensation ratio and the relative price of output to consumption (i.e. the ratio of the GDP deflator to CPI). In contrast to the traditional view, we find that the change in the relative price of output to consumption contributes the most to the wage-productivity growth gap. The decline in the relative price of output to consumption can explain 87 % of the annual growth gap between the real wage rate and labor productivity during 2002-2014. Furthermore, by decomposing the change in the relative price of output to consumption and analyzing data from South Korea, we hind that the decoupling of wage growth and productivity growth actually reflects the deteriorating toms of trade.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201806-201807160015-201807160015-263-322,46.2,2018,Academia Economic Papers
Land Rent Pattern with Commuting Mode,"Jyh-Fa Tsai, Jun-Chun Hsiao","Land rent pattern, Commuting mode, Externalities, Congestion, Accidents, Emission","This study shows that the residential land use pattern of Alonso (1964) and Muth (1969) can be obtained by choosing a commuting mode instead of the typical classification of land use directly. Differing from the related studies in the literature setting different wage rates or income levels for households, our study shows that every household with the same income still generates the varying bid rent function analytically. Comparing the commuting modes of mass transit, motorcycles, and cars, it is shown that commuting by car with a high fixed cost and a low marginal cost will be advantageous with a longer commuting distance. In contrast, commuting by mass transit with a low fixed cost and a high marginal cost will be advantageous to those traveling a shorter commuting distance. This model is then applied to the case of the Taipei metropolitan area. Two policies on the costs of commuting modes, including fuel taxes on motorcycles and cars and fares on mass transit are analyzed.

THE OPTIMAL DEGREE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION IN AN OVERLAPPING-GENERATIONS MODEL,Chi-Ting Chin,"Social welfare, Overlapping generations, Intellectual property rights (IPRs), Research and development (R&D)",Kwan and Lai (2003) obtain the optimal degree of intellectual property rights protection (IPRP) in a representative-agent model. This paper analyzes the welfare effect of intellectual property rights protection in an overlapping-generations model. It is shown that a rise in IPRP implies that the wealth is transferred from the younger to the older generations; thus it expands the wealth gap among various generations and reduces the social welfare. The optimal degree of IPRP in the overlapping-generations model is lower than that in the representative-agent model.

OPTIMAL HOUSING PRICE TO MAXIMIZE THE UTILITY OF RATIONAL HOUSING BUYERS,"Chih-Hsing Hung, Wu-Tien Chung","Optimal housing price, Risk aversion, Bequest motives","When housing prices deviate from normal prices during a housing boom, salaried workers cannot afford the higher prices. However, housing prices are affected by many factors, and housing has both a consumption function and investment motives. This paper argues that an appropriate house price can be best defined by the optimal housing price. Based on a model of the maximal utility of a rational consumer, this study takes several important parameters that affect the optimal housing price of a rational buyer, quantifies the parameters, and simulates the model with relative values. The results of the model indicate the positive impact in terms of the real growth rate of housing prices, the housing consumption preference, the real rate of return, and the risk aversion coefficient on the optimal housing price. Thus, the loan value ratio (LTV) and the bequest motives all show negative impact. However, the impacts of mortgage rates at lower rates are negative, while those at higher interest rates are positive. The optimal price increases with housing consumption preferences or the real rate of return on investment, resulting in an increase in housing consumption, or an increase in housing investment due to increased real estate prices and risk aversion.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201803-201803310015-201803310015-69-97,46.1,2018,Academia Economic Papers

Under this condition of government failure, we re-examine the optimal privatization and tariff policy, as well as their impact on social welfare. First, it is found that the optimal level of privatization will be higher and tariff will be lower (or even subsidy in some cases) whenever lobbying exists. Second, the domestic welfare will be higher under political contribution than that without, and produces Pareto improvement for both countries. Moreover, to extend the situation of trading countries with or without a Free Trade Agreement, we find that the changing direction of aggregate welfare depends on the efficiency of lobbying.

"PUBLIC INFORMATION, PRICE DISCOVERY AND ORDER CHOICES DURING THE OPENING CALL","Yi-Heng Tseng, Ping-Yang Wei","Taiwan stock exchange, Opening call auction, Price discovery, Order aggressiveness","The limit order book (LOB) of the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) has been fully opaque during the opening call in the past decade. This offers a relatively clear environment for investigating how public information affects price discovery and order choices during the opening call. We find that individual investors (symbolizing the un-informed traders) place conservative orders before opening and half of their orders cluster within 8:30-8:35 am. On the other hand, the order sizes from institutional investors (symbolizing the informed traders) are quite large and their orders tend to be more aggressive in the early stage of the opening call. The indicators of price discovery efficiency roughly emerge the I -shaped patterns, revealing that the market rapidly ＂learns＂ about the equilibrium values of stocks particularly in the first five minutes of the opening call auction. At this time, more than 90% of sample stocks significantly reject the ＂noise hypothesis＂ (Biais et al., 1999). Though public information has a weak influence on the price discovery efficiency, it nevertheless affects many aspects of order choices. Our results show that the individual investors are typical trend-followers. Their orders tend to be more aggressive when the buy or sell direction of these trades better conform to the current fluctuations of the US market index and the TAIEX Futures returns. We find that 30% of their orders belong to margin trading or short sales, and these traders somewhat chase the market prices. As for the institutional investors, it seems that they prefer short sales when the TAIEX Futures rises after market opening. Our results also suggest that though the intensity of the Market Observation Post System (MOPS) announcements significantly stimulates the order aggressiveness of individual investors, its influences on the order aggressiveness of institutional investors are much milder, indicating that there's still room for improvement with regards to the relevance and the timeliness of these announcements. Lastly, the implementation of the ＂Pre-Opening Information Disclosure Mechanism＂ on June 29, 2015 marks the end of trading in ＂black box＂ during the opening call auction in the TWSE, but nevertheless it slightly undermines the price discovery efficiency of small capital stocks. Based on the experiences learnt from leading exchanges in the world, it shows that the market transparency is the primary remedy for information asymmetry. It is noteworthy that the transparency improvement may probably lower the quality of unveiled parts of the LOB.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201712-201712200016-201712200016-503-597,45.4,2017,Academia Economic Papers

Our results indicate that under exchange rate uncertainty, antidumping policy might stimulate dumping firms to undertake foreign direct investment, especially if the filing country adopts price undertaking measures. However, if the fixed costs of foreign direct investment are much lower in a third country than those of the filing country, the dumping firms tend to undertake foreign direct investment in the third country instead. In addition, the higher the exchange rate uncertainty is, the more likely the foreign direct investment is to occur.

Our research reveals that market demand uncertainty is a crucial factor in determining the firm's location. In particular, under spatial uniform pricing, the monopoly may locate its plant at the interior post of the highway and stay away from the market with the greatest degree of demand uncertainty, whereas under discriminatory pricing, it will always locate at the market post with the least degree of demand uncertainty. Futhermore, we also find that the welfare under discriminatory pricing is greater than the welfare with uniform pricing as long as the discrepancy in the degree of demand uncertainty among markets is large enough.

Under this theoretical framework, we study the occurrence of indeterminacy. Our main results are the following: given an equal rate tariff on both imported intermediate goods and final goods, agents’ expectations cannot be fulfilled, and thus indeterminacy disappears. We find that as long as tariff rates are equal, the economy exhibits saddle-path stability when the final good is relatively labor-intensive; whereas the dynamic system is unstable when the intermediate good is relatively labor-intensive. However, if the tariff rates are unequal, our numerical simulations show that the economy may exhibit indeterminacy depending on the relative magnitude among these structural parameters such as tariff difference, skill education externality, factor substitution in intermediate goods, and the endogenous factor-intensity in final goods.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201709-201710120018-201710120018-305-350,45.3,2017,Academia Economic Papers

The result is that asymmetric dispersion, where one firm locates at the market center while the other firm locates in the interior, is the unique location equilibrium under Bertrand competition. Duopoly firms choose to agglomerate at the market center under Cournot competition. We also find that consumer surplus, industry profits, and social welfare are all higher under Cournot competition than under Bertrand competition.

The amount of the parental benefit was based on 60 percent of average insured salaries during the last six pre-childbirth months of work. In this paper, we use the 2002-2007 and 2010-2014 waves of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey to study the effect of the paid parental leave policy on the labor market outcomes of women of childbearing age. By including mothers with children aged 0-3 as a treatment group and women aged 45 or above as a control group, we use a difference-in-differences method to evaluate the policy effects on employment and wages. We take advantage of detailed information on various sources of income and recode women who were recipients of a parental benefit as the employed in order to obtain an estimate of the true employment ratio. The empirical results suggest that, for mothers who had one child at the age of one, the paid parental leave policy will lead to a reduction in the likelihood of employment by 16.82 percent.

It shows that the degree of currency substitution and the existence of foreign inflation are two crucial determinants in influencing the effects of monetary policy on the real exchange rate (hence the relative prices of non-tradable to tradable goods). The relative magnitude of the elasticities of demand for both goods and the wage differential influences critically the steady-state response and the dynamic path of output fluctuations. This dynamic general equilibrium model also shows that the impact of monetary policy on the real exchange rate (the relative prices of non-tradable to tradable goods) and the real output is greater than their steady-state changes.

An agent selects her occupation between entrepreneur and worker according to her level of entrepreneurial capability, which determines the productivity of her launched firm. Although this model is isomorphic to Melitz's heterogeneous firm model in terms of the aggregate welfare gains from trade, it enables us to see the inequality in welfare gains from trade among heterogeneous agents.

Under this framework, we examine the impact of an anticipated increase in the international price of an imported intermediate good and an imported final good on macroeconomic variables such as terms of trade, capital accumulation, and investment in a small open economy. We further investigate the steady state and dynamic behavior of relevant macroeconomic variables. The results indicate that: (1) an increase in the international price of an imported intermediate good, in the long run, will lead to a more than proportional increase in the relative price of a domestic final good in terms of an imported final good (i.e., the terms of trade); and (2) trade elasticity, substitution and intensity among production factors, as well as dependence of final production on the intermediate good, all determine whether the long-run capital stock will increase or decrease. If trade elasticity is large enough, then people increase their investment due to an anticipated increase in the relative price of the imported intermediate good. Once the relative price of the imported intermediate good actually rises, whether investment increases depends on the degree to which final-good production is dependent on the intermediate good.

With monopoly protection, pricing rises high above marginal costs, and the demand for goods is far below the optimal level, finally, resulting in deadweight loss. With infinitely-lived representative households in non-overlapping-generation models, various studies have compared several subsidy policies to correct the distortion of the monopoly pricing. On the other hand, in overlapping-generation models, since the assets of generations differ, subsidy policies transfer the wealth among the generations, forming intergenerational wealth redistribution.

We find that the strategic buying by a vertically integrated firm in the intermediate good market can make tacit collusion harder to sustain. The reason is that the effectiveness of strategic buying is inversely related to the degree of competition in the downstream market. Therefore, in the collusion phase, the integrated firm disadvantages the downstream cartel with a higher intermediate good price by buying more intermediate goods strategically. On the other hand, in the phase of Nash reversion, the punishment for deviation is ameliorated by a lower intermediate good price as a consequence of reduced strategic buying.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201612-201701040014-201701040014-487-535,44.4,2016,Academia Economic Papers

Brand Loyalty and Learning in Pharmaceutical Demand,Chung-Ying Lee,"Brand loyalty, Learning, Pharmaceuticals","Medicines for chronic conditions like high cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes are repeatedly used for a long period of time. Consumer dynamics thus plays an important role in the demand for those drugs. The paper estimates a demand model with brand loyalty and learning, using data from cholesterol-lowering drug markets in the United States. The estimates suggest high switching costs and strong learning effects at the molecule level in the markets. Switching costs raise the predicted probability of choosing the same drugs successively, and learning greatly increases patient stickiness to a molecule in the long run.

We obtain two main results as follows. First, provided that only the informational advantage of FDI is considered, international licensing can encourage FDI inflows if the variance of demand, innovation size, and fixed setup cost of FDI are small, while the foreign firm continues to select exporting otherwise. Second, when the two advantages of FDI are involved simultaneously, the effect of international licensing on FDI inflows is ambiguous, and depends upon the magnitudes of the fixed setup cost of FDI and the variance of demand in the domestic market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201609-201610170048-201610170048-361-386,44.3,2016,Academia Economic Papers

We examine how anti-dumping retaliation may arise and whether such retaliation can be a threat that dissuades a domestic firm facing dumping from first petitioning for anti-dumping protection. The findings show that the anti-dumping duty imposed by the domestic country may result in dumping in the foreign country. Under such a circumstance, the foreign firm will petition for anti-dumping protection, and thus anti-dumping retaliation arises. We further show that firms facing foreign retaliation still have the incentive to first petition for anti-dumping protection. Finally, we investigate the welfare effects of a domestic anti-dumping duty in the context of a threat of foreign antidumping retaliation.

The main contribution of this study is to use non-displaced siblings of displaced workers as a control group, which enables us to control for the unobserved genetic and family background characteristics and thereby mitigate the endogeneity problem of displacement. The monthly wage of displaced male workers reduces 5% within 1-2 years after plant closure, compared with that of their non-displaced brothers, and the effect is persistent within 2-5 years after displacement. In contrast, no significant wage loss is found for displaced female workers who were reemployed immediately after plant closure. Overall, the effect of wage reduction is more pronounced for men and lower-educated workers. We do not find evidence that job loss increases the probability of hospitalization.

Our empirical evidence does not support that the change of college recruitment results in favoring students of high SES families, either measured in terms of their residence towns' population density or the average household income tax of their residence town.

Deviating from the traditional setup, we adopt the new trade theory of increasing returns to scale (IRTS) and imperfect competition, extend it to consider firm heterogeneity (the coexistence of big and small firms), and analyze how the market size and minimum wage level might affect the firm size distribution and the rate of unemployment in a small open economy. The major findings are as follows: With big firms’ advantage in marginal cost and small firms’ advantage in fixed cost, (1) if the substitution elasticity between the big vs. small firms’ products is large enough, then larger market size will benefit the big firms. (2) Given a level of substitution elasticity, raising the minimum wage will offset the big firms’ advantage in marginal cost. Thus, the number of big firms will decline and the small ones will increase.

We consider the potential endogeneity of R&D concentration and industry R&D intensity by using firm density as an instrument. Based on the 2006 Census data on Taiwanese manufacturing, we find that R&D agglomeration fosters SMEs’ R&D activities, but it has no influence on large firms’ R&D decision. A technology regime fertile with technological opportunity is advantageous for both SMEs and large firms, whereas R&D concentration tends to be less relevant to R&D activity for both groups of firms. Moreover, an increasing but concave relationship between market concentration and R&D propensity is found for SMEs, but not for large firms.

We first characterized the equilibrium of two-sided heterogeneity as resulting from the interaction between the characteristics of competing subcontracting technologies and differences in foreign market access across contractors. We embedded the static results in a dynamic setting to address questions concerning the long-term evolution of subcontractors within the industry. Sustained upgrades were driven by heterogeneity and the expenses involved in branding. In particular, this proposed model predicts that the probability that a subcontractor firm will decide to perform branding increases when the firm produces goods that exhibit high-productivity technology. Furthermore, we demonstrate that government measures can enhance industrial upgrades to be accomplished through branding.

Local Protectionism and Market Mechanism: The Case of the Chinese Steel Industry,"Chia-Lin Chang, Wan-Wen Chu","Chinese industry, Steel industry, Local protectionism, Market mechanism, Entry and exit","In this paper we investigate the impacts of local protectionism on the development of the Chinese steel industry. We find that the entry and exit rates of the enterprises in the Chinese steel industry from 1998 to 2007 are much higher than those of other countries, which shows that this industry is highly competitive. There has, however, been an overcapacity problem in China's steel industry for a long time. Hence, we try to account for the contradiction between the two phenomena. We assume that the above situation results from the way the Chinese local governments promote the steel industry. That is, the Chinese local governments would offer preferential loans, land at low prices, and other favors to attract firms to enter the steel sector. They would also provide tax breaks or subsidized loans to certain targeted firms, so that these firms would be less likely to exit the industry when they incur losses. This policy tends to raise the exit threshold for the favored firms. We hence argue that the way the Chinese local governments promote the steel firms may have different effects on the entry and exit thresholds of different kinds of firms. We then examine how the entry and exit rates differed for different kinds of steel enterprises in terms of scale and ownership from 1998 to 2007, and test if an increase in the enterprise's productivity increased its market share and whether enterprises with low productivity exited the market more easily, in order to see if the market mechanism in China's steel market was working during this period. Our results reveal that private and smaller firms were more likely to enter the steel industry, and large-scale firms, no matter whether they are state-owned or private firms, were less likely to exit the industry. Furthermore, the market mechanism in China's steel sector was able to work effectively among the existing firms, but the mechanism weeding out backward firms was impeded. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that the way the Chinese local officials promote the steel firms leads to long-term overcapacity in the Chinese steel industry, while the market remains highly competitive.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201512-201512210015-201512210015-481-533,43.4,2015,Academia Economic Papers

Pump and Dump Price Manipulation and Early Detection in Taiwan,"Jin-Huei Yeh, Yi-Chun Lin, Shan-Ying Chu","Equity price manipulation, Pump and dump, Price bubble, Unit root test","Stock price manipulation will erode market efficiency, ruin trading orders in capital markets, and bring undesired social cost. How to detect it early has long been an interesting and important issue for academics and supervisory authorities. While we have many theoretical models deducing insightful policy implications over the past decades, empirical research is limited due to data availability. In this paper, we propose an early warning model to detect equity price manipulation using the recursive right-tailed unit root test suggested by Phillips and Yu (2011). As we aim to detect the existence of price manipulation instead of testing any specific type of manipulation, we suggest identifying manipulation via the common phenomenon of running up prices that prevails among the vast amount manipulation strategies. By retrieving the sentenced cases of price manipulation from the Law and Regulation Retrieving System of the Judicial Yuan of R.O.C. within the period from 1994 to 2010, we examine the price data and identify the manipulation period using the new technique. The ability of this model to identify manipulation is admirable when contrasted to the manipulation periods identified by the court judges. Our approach is also comparable to the scheme ＂Attention Securities Announcement＂ published by the TWSE and OTC in featuring the risk of price manipulation. We further categorize each manipulation period into 4 stages and disentangle a set of comprehensive stylized facts in understanding the patterns of pump and dump manipulation in Taiwan. Several findings are worth noticing: (1) The commonly employed GARCH model for risk evaluation does not reveal whether the equity has been manipulated. (2) The average pumping period is about 2.4 times longer than the average dumping period, and the highest pumped price can be on average 3 times as high as the initial price before pumping. (3) We can characterize the maximal possible manipulation profits and maximal possible loss for investors by the cross-sectional average holding-period returns for the pumping and dumping periods, respectively. Our easy-to-implement manipulation monitoring approach is shown to be forward looking and effective. Proper installation and implementation of it for public information disclosure may help enhance the transparency and quality of the market, deter manipulation activities, and protect uninformed investors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201512-201512210015-201512210015-589-638,43.4,2015,Academia Economic Papers

"Government Transaction Policy, Inflation, and Unemployment",Te-Tsun Chang,"Phillips curve, Government transaction, Size of government","This study examines how the size of government and government transaction policies affect the long-run relationship between inflation and unemployment in a search-theoretic framework with explicit microfoundations. Government agents, subject to the same matching technology and other constraints as private agents, are sellers and buyers in the goods market and behave exogenously regarding terms of trade. I show that public agents' transaction policies can change the private agents' incentives, the set of equilibria, and the slope of the Phillips curve. If their terms of trade resemble those of private agents, government agents ameliorate trade frictions for households and firms, thus inducing firms to hire workers. Higher inflation, and thus lower real money balances, discourage firms from hiring workers because a decrease in profits ensues. Thus, higher inflation accompanied by a larger government might induce a lower unemployment rate. If there are multiple equilibria, a sufficiently large government might eliminate the equilibrium accompanied by a high unemployment rate. However, a larger size of government induces a higher unemployment rate if a government agent makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to a firm and a household. Then, the effect of government moves in the opposite direction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201509-201510070006-201510070006-317-343,43.3,2015,Academia Economic Papers

We also investigate the effects of government policies on economic growth, the income replacement rate, and the total amount of labor insurance annuity. Research finds that an increase of the labor insurance premium rate has a negative effect on economic growth because it will cause an increasing tendency of employers to underreport employees' income. In addition, an increase in the labor insurance premium rate may reduce the total amount of labor insurance retirement annuity. In addition, the cost of underreporting wage is similar to cost of tax evasion. The lower cost of underreporting wages can contribute to economic growth and increase the income replacement rate, but it will result in a decrease in the amount of labor insurance retirement annuity.

"Tax Evasion, Financial Dualism, and Economic Growth",Fu-Sheng Hung,"Tax evasion, Financial dualism, Asian tigers, Economic growth","This paper examines the optimal policy of tax enforcement in an endogenous growth model with the presence of financial dualism. Individuals can accumulate capital by depositing savings into the formal and informal financial sectors, and capital incomes derived via informal (formal) financial institutions are evadable (non-evadable). By following the argument of new structuralists, we find that it may be optimal for countries with a less developed formal financial sector to choose a policy of tax enforcement that results in more severe tax evasion and a larger informal financial sector. Conversely, countries with a more developed formal financial sector should impose a policy of tax enforcement that leads to more tax compliance and a small size of the informal financial sector. This result is consistent with recent empirical studies. Moreover, our calibration shows that countries with a less developed financial sector and more severe tax evasion can perform equally well in terms of economic growth with those countries whose financial sector is more developed and tax evasion is less severe.

When the environmental damage function is linear, whether polluting firms are aggregate or dispersed does not affect the optimal environment policy. However, when the environmental damage function is quadratic, aggregated firms should face a higher pollution tax than dispersed firms as long as the market demand function is not too convex. Moreover, the pollution tax for aggregated firms decreases (increases) with a higher market concentration when the demand function is convex (concave). However, the pollution tax for dispersed firms increases (decreases) with a higher market concentration and a relatively large damage parameter when the demand function is convex (concave).

The results show that the average system technical efficiency score over the sample period is only 0.432, suggesting a great deal of room for FCUs to improve their efficiency. The decomposition indicates that the inefficiency is mainly from pure technical inefficiency rather than scale inefficiency. The process efficiency results signify that the efforts to improve inputs utilization efficiency in process 1 are more important than efforts to improve loan creation and problem loan control efficiencies in process 2. It is also found that the FCUs positively reacted to the financial reform.

Equilibrium Unemployment and Growth: The Role of Revenue Sharing and Bargaining Institutions,Chia-Ying Liu,"Bargaining institution, Economic growth, Revenue/profit sharing, Unemployment","This paper constructs an endogenous growth model in which (i) union wage bargaining causes equilibrium unemployment; and (ii) revenue/profit sharing is related to workers' compensation. In this setup, we prove that under a revenue sharing scheme, a growing unionized economy may be characterized by a positive relationship between unemployment and growth and, accordingly, we provide a theoretical explanation as to why in reality high unemployment can be quite compatible with high economic growth. We also find that, in an economy with revenue sharing, unionization does not exhibit a monotonic relationship with growth, but crucially depends upon the bargaining institution. This result reconciles the discrepancy between the existing theory and empirical observation. Besides, we make a comparison concerning the growth effect of a consumption tax in a full-employment economy with that in a share economy with equilibrium unemployment. It is shown that without a labor-leisure trade-off, a consumption tax has a positive effect on economic growth under either a revenue sharing scheme or a profit sharing scheme.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201412-201501160027-201501160027-485-525,42.4,2014,Academia Economic Papers

The main results from the theory analysis are as follows: (1) Increasing the tax rate imposed on the corporate bond yield reduces economic growth, employment, the inflation rate and the market price of capital. However, the impact of it on the firm’s debt-to-equity is ambiguous. (2) The impact of the corporate tax, the dividend tax, and dividend yield on economic growth, employment, inflation rate, and the debt-to-equity is ambiguous. (3) A high nominal interest rate is associated with high economic growth, employment, debt-to-equity ratio and inflation rate if the corporate tax rate is higher than the tax rate on the corporate bond yield. The numerical results are summarized in the following. The tax on the corporate tax, the corporate bond yield, and the distributed dividend is harmful to economic growth, employment, and inflation rate. Similarly, an increase in dividend yield and agency cost is harmful to macroeconomic performances. But, the impact of those policies on debt-to-equity is different.

The Price Effect of Medical Care Utilization for the Elderly: A Natural Experiment of the 921 Chi-Chi Earthquake,"Wei-Der Tsai, Chih-Chia Chen, Jack C. Yue","921 Earthquake, Medical care utilization of elderly, Price elasticity of medical care demand, Copayment exemption, Nonlinear difference-in-difference","This study aims to analyze the effect of price changes on the medical care utilization of the elderly aged 65 and above. The 921 Chi-Chi earthquake occurred on September 21, 1999, and caused severe damage to the central part of Taiwan, especially Nantou and Taichung Counties. Immediately following the earthquake, Taiwan’s government provided medical aid to the victims via waiving the NHI copayments of ambulatory care for one year and of inpatient care for two years. We use the 921 earthquake as a natural experiment to investigate how the elderly reacted to the copayment exemption. By using the difference-in-difference in nonlinear regression specification, on one hand, we compare a group of veterans, who were victims and lived in the affected areas, with nonveteran victims, to identify the effect of price subsidization. On the other hand, we compared the victim veterans living in the affected area with the non-victim veterans living in the unaffected area to identify the impact of earthquake damage on the medical care utilization. Our empirical results show that the government copayment exemption policy increased the mean number of outpatient visits per person by 3.24 for all observations and 3.5 for the male sample, and had no effect on inpatient care either in the probability of hospitalization or length of stay after hospitalization. The earthquake resulted in an increase of 4.63 in the mean number of outpatient visits per person for all observations (4.55 for the male sample), and an increase of 10.37% and 2.66% in the likelihood of hospitalization roughly (12.58% and 3.29% for the male sample), respectively, in the first year and second year following the earthquake. The price elasticity of outpatient care for the elderly was about -0.05 for all observations and -0.06 for the male sample. Our empirical results provide some policy implications regarding the control of the growth of medical costs for the elderly.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201412-201501160027-201501160027-599-645,42.4,2014,Academia Economic Papers
Welfare Effects of Economic Integration in the Presence of VIIT,"Yen-Ju Lin, Yan-Shu Lin, Zhi-Win Wu","Vertical intra-industry trade, Economic integration, Vertical product differentiation, Welfare effects","This paper constructs a vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT) model to explore the welfare effects of economic integration with different quality products as well as the role of the degree of quality differentiation. We take into account both popular settings of trade costs in the literature-transport costs and tariffs-and find that there is a significant diversity in welfare efficacy. In the transport costs setting, no matter what the product quality differences are, the low quality country will be better off as economic integration proceeds. However, the high quality country might be better off or worse off during the process of economic integration, depending on the degree of quality differentiation. This implies that what is good for the high quality country also benefits the low quality country, but the opposite is not always true. Contrarily, in the tariffs setting, a drop in trade costs definitely benefits the high quality country, while it may harm the low quality country. This shows that a tariff reduction gives rise to a conflict between the two countries, and economic integration is not always an easy road to travel on.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201412-201501160027-201501160027-647-679,42.4,2014,Academia Economic Papers
Does D&O Insurance Enhance Target Shareholder Wealth during M&As?,Chia-Wei Chen,"D&O insurance, Shareholder wealth, M&As","Following the increasing number of corporate wrongdoings, directors' and officers' liability (D&O) insurance, ideally designed to protect shareholder wealth, has attracted increasing attention from both scholars and practitioners. This insurance may enhance the function of the board and reduce conservatism. However, moral hazard problems may undermine the incentive for board monitoring and hence induce managers to pursue their own interests at the expense of shareholder wealth. Analyzing 129 listed firms announced to be acquired during the period from 2008 to 2010, the empirical findings indicate that target firms carrying D&O insurance tend to suffer lower cumulative abnormal returns (CARs). Moreover, the difference remains significant when alternative approaches or subsamples are applied, suggesting that the cons of this D&O insurance seem to outweigh the pros. Since the findings provide international evidence on the role of D&O insurance, disclosure of the information on this insurance, advocated recently in several nations, is worthy of support.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201409-201410280018-201410280018-305-329,42.3,2014,Academia Economic Papers

This study adopts a simultaneous equation framework to understand the link between growth and profit since they are competing and interdependent variables for managers. The inverse relationship between size and growth, found across different subsamples and time periods, provides a challenge to the Law of Proportionate Effects. Profit persistence in the overall sample disappears with the exclusion of the state-owned monopoly of the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) and within the more competitive period 2003-2006 when growth persistence is found. Abnormal profits in the previous period prompt faster growth in the next period.

On the to Estimate the Risk of Life Insurance Reserves,"Ming-Hua Hsieh, Ya-Wen Hwang, Wei-Yu Kuo, Cheng-Hsien Tsai","Risk management, Life insurance, Reserving","How to measure the risk of policy reserves is important for life insurers because policy reserves are the largest liabilities with long durations. In this paper, we propose the ＂QPQ＂ method for determining the risk of policy reserves. We compare our approach with the traditional P-measure approach and Q-measure approach proposed by QIS 2 of Solvency II. Under the P-measure approach, the discount rate should be theoretically adjusted by risk premiums. However, it is difficult to determine the risk premiums of liabilities, and thus most studies have not considered the risk premium adjustment. Under the Q-measure approach, risk factors are simulated under the assumptions of risk neutrality. The movements of the risk factors, however, do not reflect the real movements of risk factors, and thus can-not reflect the possible real-world fluctuation of the reserves. The QPQ method can avoid the drawbacks of the above approaches.Based on the QPQ method, life insurers use best estimate valuation to determine their reserves at time t = 0 under Q measure. Then they generate stochastic future economic states (risk factors) from time 0 to time T under P-measure and apply the best estimate valuation to quantify their reserves at time t = H. For each scenario of the simulated stochastic future economic states, the reserve is again computed using best estimate valuation. The distribution of the reserve at time t = H is then discounted back to time t = 0 by the risk-free rate with maturity H. At the last step, commonly used risk measures (e.g., VaR and CTE) on the reserve distribution at time t = 0 are used to quantify the risk margin of the reserves.We apply the QPQ method to calculate the risk of reserves of the endowment policy, interest sensitive annuity, and equity-indexed annuity. We find that there exist significant differences between the QPQ, P-measure, and Q-measure approaches. The risk of reserves is overestimated under P-measure. However, the risk margin under Q-measure is lower than that under the QPQ method, suggesting that the risk of reserves is underestimated under Q-measure. Since the adequacy of policy reserves is critical to the solvency of life insurers, we suggest life insurers adopt the QPQ method to estimate and manage the reserve risk.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201409-201410280018-201410280018-403-434,42.3,2014,Academia Economic Papers

We argue that the supply and price of reinsurance may adjust in accordance with the change of non-life insurers' loss ratio. The results show that loss ratio negatively affect reinsurance use. Besides, we also find that loss ratio weakens the positive relation between leverage and reinsurance use. This implies that the increase in loss ratio is associated with the shortage of reinsurance supply, leading to less use of reinsurance by non-life insurers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201409-201410280018-201410280018-435-483,42.3,2014,Academia Economic Papers

The results indicate that for policyholders who are likely to adjust their coverage, current portfolios of two types of automobile insurance significantly affect their insurance portfolios in the following policy year. In fact, customers purchase the two kinds of automobile insurance policies as substitutes or complements to realize equilibrium potentials.

Since most studies of moral hazard in comprehensive automobile insurance in Taiwan used data before the premium rate deregulation, this study turns to analyze the same issue by using data after it. After eliminating policies when policyholders switched their policies to different contract form most likely due to a learning effect and to make the claim conditions of the renewal form coincide with those of the initial form, a negative incentive effect was found to exist when policyholders switched their policies from form C to non-deductible form B. But the negative incentive effect was not found when policyholders switched their policies from deductible form B to non-deductible form B.

We employ a two-part model to investigate the effect of distribution systems on the quality of insurance policies, and use 12,746 individual health insurance policies effective in 2002 from a life insurance company in Taiwan. We track the claims that occurred during the period from 2002 to 2007, and use their information as a proxy for the quality of the insurance contracts. The results show that the distribution system affects the quality of contracts. Specifically, bancassurance channels are the best of the three distribution systems, regardless of whether a claim is filed within a two-year period or for the first time, and no matter the probability of claims, and the number of claims. Secondly, telemarketing channels are better than traditional insurance salespersons channels when considering the file claimed for the first time, and no matter the probability of claims, and the number of claims.

The major findings are as follows:(1) In the long run, the rise of the Tobin tax rate would cause the real exchange rate to decrease, output to increase, and real foreign currency balances to decrease, but whether the real balances increase or decrease depends on the magnitude between the currency substitution elasticities.(2) In the short run, the magnitude of foreign inflation rates is crucial in influencing the behavior of real exchange rates, (i.e., real exchange rates may overshoot, undershoot or misjump around their equilibrium values) while the magnitude of the effect of the Tobin tax on the stock of foreign currency and other structure parameters in the model are key elements to determine the degree of real exchange rate movements.(3) The range of an increase in the rate of the Tobin tax should be smaller than monetary expansion in order to maintain real exchange rate stability. It is shown that if the degree of currency substitution is higher, the range of an increase in the rate of the Tobin tax should be bigger; if the cost elasticity of holding foreign currency is higher, the range of an increase in the rate of the Tobin tax should be smaller.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201312-201312250031-201312250031-559-596,41.4,2013,Academia Economic Papers
Technology Licensing in Multiple Markets,"Ray-Yun Chang, Hong Hwang, Cheng-Hau Peng","Technology transfer, Two-part tariff licensing, Multiple markets","Most studies which address licensing treat a licensor firm as either an insider or outsider. To integrate the two extreme cases, this paper sets up a model in which the licensee firm can produce two goods, one is homogeneous to and the other is horizontally differentiated from that produced by the licensor firm. The licensor firm licenses its superior technology to a licensee firm via a two-part tariff contract. It is found that if the innovation is non-drastic, the optimal licensing contract is composed of a pure royalty (two-part tariffs) if the innovation is small (large). On the other hand, with a drastic innovation, the licensor firm, contraposition to that in a single market case, definitely licenses its technology to its rival. Moreover, the royalty rate and the fixed fee in the optimal two-part tariff contract should both be positive.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201312-201312250031-201312250031-597-613,41.4,2013,Academia Economic Papers

A journal ranking list can be useful to researchers as a publication reference and to institutions as the basis for hiring, promotion, and resource allocation decisions. The existing list of journal ranking used by many institutions in Taiwan is based on decade-old data which may be considered outdated. It is therefore important to update the ranking using the most recent data. Both quantitative and qualitative measures are used in updating the ranking. The quantitative measure is based on the impact factor of a journal, and the factor is further adjusted using an axiomatic approach to obtain a robust index. For the qualitative measure, expert meetings were held and the opinions and suggestions therein are adopted to help shape the final ranking of the journals.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201309-201310140023-201310140023-327-361,41.3,2013,Academia Economic Papers
"Financial Restraint, Capital Investment, and Economic Growth","Fu-Sheng Hung, Wen-Ya Chang","Financial restraint, Financial development, Asymmetric information, Credit rationing, Economic growth","We examine the effects of a government policy of financial restraint on capital investment and economic growth. To promote capital investment, conventional wisdom has long suggested that the government adopts a policy of financial restraint that keeps the interest rate below the equilibrium level. In contrast, many countries have recently adopted the policy of financial liberalization according to the McKinnon-Shaw thesis. This paper re-examines the effects of financial restraint by developing a model that incorporates both the conventional wisdom and the McKinnon-Shaw thesis. We find that there are optimal levels of financial restraints measured by a lending rate ceiling below the equilibrium level which maximizes economic growth and social welfare, respectively. Our results are consistent with recent empirical evidence showing that a mild financial restraint is beneficial to capital investment and economic growth.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201309-201310140023-201310140023-363-398,41.3,2013,Academia Economic Papers
The Impact of Offshore Production on Within-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity,Chu-Ping Lo,"Offshore production, Firm heterogeneity, Selection","This paper extends Melitz's (2003) dynamic industry model by incorporating Antràs and Helpman's (2004) outsourcing structure to show that a within-industry selection of heterogeneous firms can be driven by offshoring. In a North-South world, offshoring enables relatively more productive firms in the North to leverage foreign resources to expand their market shares at the expense of the relatively less productive firms. This endogenous selection enables an economy to transit to high-productivity varieties, thereby raising the aggregate industry productivity. In particular, offshore production increases the number of product varieties in offshore-intensive industries but reduces that in less offshore-intensive industries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201309-201310140023-201310140023-399-420,41.3,2013,Academia Economic Papers
Effects of Operational Risk and Reputational Risk for Financial Institutions and the Role of Corporate Governance,"Yong-Chin Liu, Xi-Ruo Wang, Mei-Hua Liao","Operational risk, Reputational risk, Event study method, Abnormal return, Industry-adjusted earnings","This study examines the effects of various operational risk events for banks from 1990 to 2011 on stock price reaction, profitability, risk and reputational loss, as well as whether corporate governance can reduce the impact of operational risk. For internal-factor and external-factor events, we separately estimate both the stock abnormal returns (ARs) and industry-adjusted excess earnings, along with reputational losses within the ARs and excess earnings, for occurring, finding and announcing days, respectively. Our findings indicate that the internal fraud events face significantly negative ARs, excess earnings and reputational losses during the announcement period; the stock risks do not increase, and prices moderately reflect decreasing profitability. The serious disasters and events resulting from external factors face no negative excess earnings, but have negative ARs and reputational losses during both the occurring and announcement periods. Moreover, the post-event stock nonsystematic risks increase and stock prices have overreactions. Based on regression analyses, among corporate governance mechanisms, information disclosure and insider ownership can reduce nonsystematic risks and alleviate the impact of operational and reputational losses on market values; meanwhile, no significant effect for the other mechanisms is observed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201309-201310140023-201310140023-421-471,41.3,2013,Academia Economic Papers

Comparison of the Vickrey Second-Price and Random nth-Price Auctions for Analyzing Country of Origin Labeling in Taiwan,"Wen S. Chern, Jia-Pei Hong, Ernest Kang Liu","Auction, Country of origin labeling, Tobit, Bid premium, Taiwan, China, Vietnam",The purpose of this study is to compare the random nth-price auction with the widely used Vickrey second-price auction in an empirical application. It has been shown that the second-price auction does not induce sincere bidding for those who are off-margin of the market clearing price. The random nth-price auction can correct this drawback. These two auction methods were applied and compared for investigating the economic benefits for country of origin labeling (COOL) regulation in Taiwan. The consumer's willingness to pay (WTP) premiums for oolong tea produced in Taiwan vs. those imported from China and Vietnam were elicited using these two experimental auctions. Auction results revealed very different bidding behaviors. The random nth-price auction appeared to induce more sincere bidding than the second-price auction in this study. Tobit and the ordinary least squares (OLS) models were used to estimate the bid and premium functions. Econometric results from both auction methods all showed that participants were willing to pay very high premiums for Taiwanese oolong tea over those from China and Vietnam. The net price premiums for Taiwanese oolong tea due to COOL are estimated to be 57% over Vietnamese tea and 56% over Chinese tea. These results have important policy implications for agricultural trade between Taiwan and China.,https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201306-201307170030-201307170030-215-254,41.2,2013,Academia Economic Papers
The Crowding-Out Effects of Old-Age Economic Security on Fertility: Evidence from Taiwan,Yen-Ling Lin,"Fertility, Old-age economic security, Count data, Poisson regression","This study investigates the effects of old-age economic security on fertility. The fertility rate has exhibited a downward tendency in many countries following the postwar baby boom. In the early years, the fertility rate decreased due to industrialization. While various related factors, such as women’s education, wage and labor participation, were highly developed in many developed countries by the end of the 20th century, these have been insufficient to explain the current fertility rate tendency. In this research we use multiyear cross-sectional data from the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure to investigate the old-age economic security effects. Our empirical results show that the stronger the old-age economic security is, the more the number of births is crowded out. We suggest that governments should establish a mutual assistance mechanism between the old-age economic security policies and fertility policies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201306-201307170030-201307170030-255-295,41.2,2013,Academia Economic Papers

Hsu et al. (2012) cast doubt on estimates in previous empirical studies on the effect using gravity regression. The potential bias comes from ignoring the important interactive effect of relative demand and trade cost on locational choice and thus on trade patterns. Using a dataset on the trade flow of creative goods from APEC countries, we find that after controlling for the interactive term, the estimated coefficients on the elasticity of demand are much corrected toward those predicted by theory.

Killing the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs?-Evidence from the Reduction of the Futures Transaction Tax in Taiwan,"Shih-Chang Huang, Hsin-Yi Lin, Hsien-Ming Lien","Difference-in-differences, Taiwan stock index future, Morgan Stanley stock index future, Futures transaction tax","To energize the futures market and attract foreign investments, the Taiwan government since 1998 has reduced the transactions tax levied on futures three times. Although the existing literature overwhelmingly supports the view that a tax cut substantially increases the trading volume and thus effectively buffers the negative impact on tax revenue, almost all empirical works are conducted based on a before-and-after analysis-comparing the trading volume of Taiwan stock index futures (TSIF) before and after the tax reduction. However, such an evaluation is likely to induce endogenous bias, because of failure to account for changes in the economic environment during the same period. Using Morgan Stanley Taiwan stock index futures (MSTSIF) as the control, this paper employs the difference-in-differences method to examine how the TSIF volume increases as a result of reducing the (index) futures transaction tax from 2.5 to 1 basis point in January 2006. Our results show that this tax cut increased TSIF trading volume by 11.0% in the following year, less than half of the increase obtained from before-and-after analysis (24.4%). Moreover, the growth of trading volume of TSIF declines to 5.6% when extending our sample to two years. We conclude that the increase of TSIF volume due to tax reduction is mostly a short-term effect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201303-201304230009-201304230009-1-37,41.1,2013,Academia Economic Papers

Second, we also find that stronger creditor rights will help improve banking risk in developing countries, whereas they worsen it in developed countries. Third, we find evidence that political and legal institutions are independent in developed countries, but they are substitutes in developing countries. Finally, we find that freedom of the press in developed countries and corruption in developing countries are potential factors through which political rights may affect banking risk.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201303-201304230009-201304230009-39-83,41.1,2013,Academia Economic Papers

This is done by comparing the empirical performance of the asset pricing models with a time varying discount factor to the model with a constant discount factor. We employ the noise ratio method developed by Durlauf and Maccini (1995), to demonstrate the relative degree to which each null model approximates the data. The specification tests are applied to the data of Taiwan's stock market as well as the S&P 500, and we find evidence that the asset pricing model with a time varying discount factor is superior to that with a constant discount factor. In order to make the test robust, we design a testing procedure of the t, Wilcoxon, and DM statistics to test the magnitude of the noise ratio difference between these models using a post-sample approach, which is generated by both recursive regression and rolling regression. The results show that there do exist some time-varying discount factor models that are superior to the benchmark for both indices.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201303-201304230009-201304230009-85-125,41.1,2013,Academia Economic Papers
Asymmetric Pricing in the Gasoline and Diesel Markets of Taiwan,Kuo-Wei Chou,"Oil prices, Exchange rate, Production-distribution chain, Error correction models, Asymmetric pricing","This paper applies an asymmetric error correction model with threshold cointegration to explore the links between gasoline and diesel price adjustments in Taiwan and the prices of international oil. Oil prices and the exchange rate are the major input costs involved in refining gasoline and diesel. Upon examining the petroleum production-distribution chain, we assessed price asymmetry at the refinery and distribution stages. This paper finds that gasoline and diesel price adjustments follow a politico-economic asymmetry; that is, prices adjust more quickly to cost decreases than to cost increases. Exchange rate shocks are the main source of price asymmetry. By comparing kinds of gasoline, and stages in the production-distribution chain, we infer that asymmetry is caused by production and inventory adjustment costs, imperfect competition, and consumer search behaviors. It appears, however, that price adjustments are principally dominated by the political and economic concerns of the oil companies. Finally, we show that price asymmetry has a significant effect on consumer gains in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201303-201304230009-201304230009-127-181,41.1,2013,Academia Economic Papers
Optimal Monetary Policy for Taiwan: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Framework,"Yu-Ning Hwang, Pei-Ying Ho","Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE), Monetary policy, Credit channel","The objective of this paper is to investigate the monetary policy of Taiwan by using a micro-based dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with a banking sector. Because Taiwan's central bank has claimed to use the M2 aggregate growth rate as the monetary target since 1992, this study essentially centers on the welfare assessments of the optimized money growth rate rule and the alternative Taylor-type interest rate rule. We find that the money growth rate rule plays a better job in stabilization and is welfare dominating over the interest rate rule for all types of real shocks. Due to the liquidity effects that the monetary aggregate supplies for consumption, controlling the growth rate of the monetary aggregate can successfully reduce both the inflation and output volatilities. The welfare superiority of the monetary aggregate rule holds for alternative specifications of the model, including the frictionless credit market, the lower international capital mobility and lower nominal rigidity. The current monetary policy, estimated by Teo (2009), follows in a similar fashion to the optimized monetary policy that this study suggests, but has smaller effects in stabilizing the CPI inflation and exchange rates. Reinforcing its endeavors in inflation and exchange rate stabilization can be welfare improving.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201212-201301280009-201301280009-447-482,40.4,2012,Academia Economic Papers

To account for this large estimate uncertainty, this paper develops the corresponding Bayesian sampling algorithms for Watson's decomposition method and Apel and Jansson's systems approach. We assess our algorithms by conducting a series of Monte Carlo simulation experiments. To illustrate the practical relevance of our algorithms, we also apply them to Taiwan's seasonally unadjusted data and incorporate the idea of seasonal unit root into our Bayesian framework. Simulation and empirical analyses show that our Bayesian sampling algorithms are flexible and do not merely duplicate the maximum likelihood estimates. We find that the maximum likelihood estimate generally understates the parameter variability and puts too little weight on the variance. A Bayesian approach allows for more stochastic variation in the permanent and cyclical components. Our analysis demonstrates that the posterior distribution facilitates assessment of the parameter uncertainty such that a Bayesian approach is rich enough to cope with model specification issues and provides more relevant information for conducting monetary and fiscal policies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201212-201301280009-201301280009-483-523,40.4,2012,Academia Economic Papers

Empirical Decomposition and Economic Growth Forecasting,"Jin-Huei Yeh, Nick Y. P.

(1998), to disentangle and forecast Taiwan's real GDP growth. We find that the real GDP could be decomposed into six stationary and near-orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), along with a nonlinear trend. Specifically, some IMFs have cyclical patterns similar to the Hodrick-Prescott filtered real GDP series under certain smoothing parameters. Based on the empirical stationarity and near-orthogonality of the IMFs, we can estimate and forecast these component series easily through simple time series models. In particular, our approach differs from the typical difference-first-then-fit recipes in that it retains all information and dynamic content of the original series instead of discarding partial information, which can be relevant for anticipating futures, due to differencing. By comparing with the other popular methodologies, linear or nonlinear, in predicting Taiwan's real GDP quarterly growth, our empirical results confirm the superior yet simple forecasting performance of the new approach.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201212-201301280009-201301280009-559-598,40.4,2012,Academia Economic Papers

For Taiwan's economic growth rate, the effects of optimism/pessimism and overreaction/under-reaction to the news on forecasts during the expansion and contraction periods of real activity are identified in the proposed framework. Overall, our empirical results discover that Taiwan's government usually under-reacts to the news during business cycles, and tends to be pessimistic, especially in expansions. Besides, these behavioral biases in the post-2001 period are much more significant than those in the pre-2001 period. On the other hand, when comparing the government to the private sector in Taiwan, these behavioral biases affect the private sector's forecasts much more severely. Moreover, in our in-sample and out-of-sample experiments, the forecast performance improves significantly after correcting the identified behavioral biases of the Taiwan government's forecast.

Exchange Rate and Pricing to Market: Evidence from Taiwan's Exports of Woven Fabric of Synthetic Fiber,"En-En Huang, Ching-Yu Lan, Biing-Shen Kuo","Pricing to market, Exchange rate pass-through, Textile industry, Woven fabric of synthetic fiber","This study empirically investigates the pricing to market behavior of Taiwan's woven fabric of synthetic fiber exports to 5 major foreign markets, including the U.S., China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Pricing to market refers to adjustment of exporter's markup to exchange rate movements, thus depending on degree of competition facing exporters in any particular market. Nevertheless, change in exchange rates also induces change in marginal cost of production. The novelty of our paper lies in an ability to differentiate the effect of change in exchange rates on the markup adjustment from that on the marginal cost, by making use of the simple cost structure in the textile industry. Without applying time dummies as proxies for cost as in Knetter (1995), the empirical validity of the restrictions on parameters implied by theory can now be formally tested. We find significant evidence for the pricing to market behavior of Taiwan's exports of woven fabric of synthetic fiber. Of more interest is the finding that producers adjust their markups to a greater extent for exports to the U.S. and Indonesia in the absence of quota protections, suggesting higher competition.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201209-201210220017-201210220017-417-446,40.3,2012,Academia Economic Papers

Utilizing the orthogonally decomposed stationary regularity series from real quarterly GDP and CPI by EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition), an empirical adaptive decomposition method that aims to entertain nonlinear and nonstationary time series, we demonstrate the close coupling relationship between long-run stock market volatility and the business cycle fluctuations. As these component series preserve the most primary information in the macroeconomic state variables sampled at lower frequencies, the long-run component volatility is capable of generating regime shift behaviors in daily volatility without resorting to Markov switching or other regime switching mechanisms. Moreover, the prediction of future volatility at various horizons is easy within the framework by taking advantage of the decomposed stable cyclical pattern of these macroeconomic series. By further examining the relative contribution of 3 factors (namely long-term, medium-term and short-term) comprising the long-run risk to the overall volatility, we find that the median frequency factor in long-run volatility explains the turbulent market variations during periods of recession.

Considering the possible endogeneity property of private tutoring spending, we use the instrumental variables method for estimation, and the results show that on average a one hour per week increase in parents' hands-on tutoring will increase private tutoring spending by about NT$5,400.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201206-201208030029-201208030029-237-268,40.2,2012,Academia Economic Papers
Pricing Dynamic Guaranteed Funds under a Double Exponential Jump Diffusion Model,"Chuang-Chang Chang, Ya-Huei Lian, Min-Hung Tsay","Dynamic guaranteed funds, Jump diffusion model, Double exponential jump diffusion model, Laplace transform","This paper complements the extant literature to evaluate the prices of dynamic guaranteed funds when the price of underlying naked fund follows a double exponential jump diffusion process. We first derive the closed-form solution for the Laplace transform of dynamic guaranteed fund price, and then apply the efficient Gaver-Stehfest algorithm to Laplace inversion to obtain the prices of dynamic guaranteed funds. Based on the numerical pricing results, we find that the proposed pricing method is much more efficient than the Monte Carlo simulation approach although it loses a sufficiently small accuracy. On the other hand, we also provide an investigation on the behavior of prices of dynamic guaranteed funds when jump is taken into consideration. In addition, the sensitivity analyses of the prices of dynamic guaranteed funds with respect to jump-related parameters and the relative errors between the prices of continuous-monitored and discretely-monitored dynamic guaranteed fund are given in this paper as well.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201206-201208030029-201208030029-269-306,40.2,2012,Academia Economic Papers
Replacement Cost Insurance and Moral Hazard: Empirical Evidence of Automobile Theft Insurance in Taiwan,"Chun-Ting Liu, Chia-Ling Ho, Shu-Hui Hsieh","Replacement cost policy, Actual cash value policy, Moral hazard, Automobile theft insurance","Based on claim analysis of the replacement cost policy and the actual cash value policy in the automobile insurance market, this paper examines whether the protection of the replacement cost policy can induce moral hazard. The results show that the loss theft rate is higher one month before the replacement cost policy expires than that of the actual cash value policy. We confirm that the protection for the replacement cost will result in moral hazard. In addition, some characteristics of the insured car and policyholder may be the root cause of moral hazard. According to empirical findings based on regression analysis, there may be a moral hazard with policyholders for domestic cars, insured cars of 700 to 799 thousand NT dollars, the first two years of new cars, and younger policyholders from 18 to 29 years old. However, an effective underwriting policy can be adopted to control the moral hazard induced from protection for the replacement cost of automobile theft insurance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201203-201205030003-201205030003-2-34,40.1,2012,Academia Economic Papers
Trade Effects of Regional Trade Agreements on Taiwan: An Empirical Study Using Gravity Model,"Zong-Shin Liu, Mei-Ying Lai, Chih-Huan Chen","Regional trade agreement, Gravity model, Import diversion effect, Export diversion effect, Panel data","Since the early 1990s, the major trading partners of Taiwan consecutively signed Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs). Taiwan, however, is not a member of those RTAs. What trade effects do those RTAs have on Taiwan? Do they affect trade relations of Taiwan with its trading partners? Most previous studies merely evaluate the average trade effects of RTAs, which cannot be applied to correctly assess the trade effects on Taiwan. This study is the first to construct a parsimonious gravity model, focusing on the trade between Taiwan and its trading partners, and uses panel data covering 21 countries from 1980 to 2008 to empirically investigate the trade effects on Taiwan of five RTAs signed between its trading partners. The major findings are summarized as follows: NAFTA, EU and ANZCER have significant import diversion effects on Taiwan, where NAFTA also exhibits an export diversion effect. In contrast, both AFTA and CEPA have positive effects on imports from and exports to Taiwan. Regarding the net trade effects, both AFTA and CEPA can enhance trade relations with Taiwan, but NAFTA, EU and ANZCER do the opposite. Moreover, most RTAs are found to have significant trade effects on Taiwan since they went into force, and each member of all RTAs has different trade effects on Taiwan. According to the results, it should be helpful for expanding external trade if Taiwan could sign bilateral FTAs with the U.S.A. and ASEAN countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201203-201205030003-201205030003-35-77,40.1,2012,Academia Economic Papers
"Education Quotas, Progressive Taxes, and Long-Run Output",Jing-Jun Chang,"Education quotas, Progressive taxes, Peer effect, Cramming for examination","Theoretical studies often suggest that progressive taxes, when compared to flat-rate taxes, are harmful for economic performance. This paper attempts to provide an alternative. We show that progressive taxes might be good for long-run output and upward intergenerational mobility in a society with education quotas. Since the number of students of a university is limited, progressive taxes might result in more talented children of the poor going to universities instead of the untalented children of the rich. This might stimulate the educated workers to accumulate more human capital by peer effects. Therefore the positive effect of human capital accumulation on output might outweigh the negative impact of work hour reduction in some situations and have higher output in the long run.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201203-201205030003-201205030003-78-108,40.1,2012,Academia Economic Papers
Bank Ownership Types and Multiple Relationships with Corporate Clients,"Bih-Yun Kuo, Jing-Twen Chen","Bank ownership types, Multiple relationships, Enterprise credit record, Dependence level of the client to the creditor bank, Information asymmetry","This study aims to investigate the multiple relationships of creditor banks and their clients through ”the ownership of the creditor bank” and ”the dependence level of the client to the creditor bank”. The empirical results are as follows: (1) the banks prefer to have relationships with micro-enterprises with a high level of information transparency. The higher the score of the credit rating of the chairperson, the less desire there is to build the multiple relationships with the micro-enterprise; and micro-enterprises with bad credit have more difficulty to build up the multiple relationships. Due to the foreign bank supply, the microenterprises with sufficient funds do not develop multiple relationships aggressively; these results are obviously opposite to the findings of Berger et al. (2008). The more lending there is from a private financial holding company or non-financial holding company, the more they tend to develop the multiple relationships. The implication shows that the banks provide insufficient funds, and the banking relationship is unstable. (2) The more the medium and large companies borrow from foreign banks, the fewer relationship banks they have; but the opposite result shows that the more they borrow from private banks, the more they intend to build up the multiple relationships with banks. The results also show that credit availability and relationships are less stable for private banks than state-owned banks. The contribution to the micro-enterprises by state-owned banks is not less than the private banks in Taiwan; this finding is contrary to the finding of Kumar and Francisco (2005), and we also find that state-owned banks have less intention to provide funds than private banks. (3) Banks tend to support medium and large companies with huge fund investment in R&D to avoid their effort in finding new relationship banks. When the R&D expenditure ratio is more than 1.8%, these companies do not need to depend on the indirect financing through banks, and use their own advantages to issue commercial paper, corporate bond or issue CB domestically or abroad. (4) the larger the size of the private financing holding companies, the more liquidity they have to provide sufficient funds to meet the corporate financing needs than the private banks; therefore when private financing holding companies provide more credit availability to medium and large companies, the latter have a significant decrease in the number of the relationship banks.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201203-201205030003-201205030003-109-159,40.1,2012,Academia Economic Papers
Gaussian Inference in Dynamic Panels with Fixed Effects Based on Second Differencing,"Jhih-Gang Chen, Biing-Shen Kuo","Panel unit root test, Moment conditions, Weak instruments","This paper develops a new approach to estimation in dynamic panel data models with fixed effects and incidental trends, based on second differencing. The proposed estimation method is immune to the weak instrument problem that is known to arise when the conventional GMM is applied to the cases where the autoregressive coefficient (ρ) is close to unity. Similar to the first-difference estimator introduced by Han and Phillips (2010, pp. 119-151), the new estimator has standard Gaussian asymptotics for all values of ρ ∈ (-1, 1) in both panel and time series cases. Given its smaller asymptotic variance when the series exhibit positive or moderate positive autocorrelation, the panel unit root test built on the second-difference estimator is more powerful than that built on Han and Phillips' counterpart.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201112-201202140021-201202140021-5-42,39.4,2011,Academia Economic Papers
Deterrence Strategy in Generation Competition,Hsueh-Jen Hsu,"Technological competence difference, Deterrence strategy, Generation competition,  Finance constraint","In some industries, the size of the main raw material used in each new generation of production line is much larger than that used in the previous generation. The main material also is more fully utilized. Therefore the output of each new generation increases dramatically, and its average variable cost decreases significantly. However, equipment users may have to play a main role in developing the new technology. When the expense of R&D and physical investment are financed mainly from a firm's profit, a low-cost firm can strategically raise capacity utilization rate and force its rivals to give up initiating the developing process. The first question is whether low-cost firm can successfully deter high-cost firm from advancing to the new generation? Second, is it rational for the low-cost firm to adopt such a deterrence strategy? The findings of this paper are: when the capacity enlargement efficiency is large or small, the deterrence strategy would be unnecessary and ineffective respectively. When the capacity enlargement efficiency falls at a medium level, the deterrence strategy is both credible and effective in deterring the high-cost firm from developing new technology. The larger the cost difference between firms, the more likely it is that the low-cost firm will adopt deterrence strategy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201112-201202140021-201202140021-43-75,39.4,2011,Academia Economic Papers

In the present study, we utilize a generalized oligopoly model to analyze how economic integration between two countries with income disparity affects their welfare and FDI, and have reached the following conclusions. If the governments of the two countries do not impose any tax or subsidy policy on FDI, (1) the country with higher income will attract more FDI; (2) the magnitude of the FDI is positively related to the income disparity; (3) the FDIs will not be affected by the trade cost. On the other hand, if the two governments impose taxes or subsidies on FDI, (1) the governments will levy taxes (subsidies) on FDI if the trade cost is small (large); (2) FDI to the low-income country is higher than that to the high-income country, and the difference in FDIs increases with the integration; (3) both countries are better off after economic integration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201112-201202140021-201202140021-76-100,39.4,2011,Academia Economic Papers

Results of numerical analysis suggest that exam takers differ in their responses to an educational expansion when facing various talent distributions and degrees of test discriminability. In some cases, severe competition exists among some group of exam takers, and its effects spill over to other exam takers outside this group. In sum, we propose related policy thinking as follows: increasing either educational resources for disadvantageous students or the degree of test discriminability under a differential expansion system can decrease the effort levels in preparing for the exam and raise the total welfare of all exam takers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201112-201202140021-201202140021-101-135,39.4,2011,Academia Economic Papers

It is shown that the upstream monopolist may charge a more efficient local retailer a lower input price under price discrimination. This finding is of interest as it goes against the standard conclusion in the input price discrimination literature. Moreover, contrary to the general findings in the literature in which input price discrimination is welfare-deteriorating, we find that input price discrimination improves social welfare if the positive output allocation efficiency effect outweighs the negative production efficiency effect.

The European Commission accepted the argument and punished Microsoft. This paper sets up a duopoly model with one domestic firm and one foreign firm to analyze the effects of bundling behavior by the foreign firm on the innovation and profit of the domestic firm, consumer surplus, and social welfare under Bertrand or Cournot competition. There are two products in the model in which product 1 is produced only by the foreign firm and product 2 is produced by both firms. Assuming that the two goods are independent in demand and the two firms engage in innovation only for product 2, we find that the bundling practice decreases the foreign firm's innovation, but increases the domestic firm's innovation under Bertrand competition. However, it decreases both firms' innovation. Moreover, the bundling practice always increases the domestic firm's profits and innovation of the industry, and reduces the domestic consumer surplus and welfare.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201109-201201110011-201201110011-2-28,39.3,2011,Academia Economic Papers

Empirical results indicate that the central bank adopts a counter-cyclical monetary policy rule, and exchange rate stability is an important target in the conducted policy. Besides, monetary policies have asymmetric effects on macro variables and the estimated threshold value is positive. An increase in the exchange rate change, measured in its absolute value, increases the interest rate under a depreciation regime, but it decreases the interest rate under an appreciation regime.

According to wavelet analysis, the Dow Jones Industrial Index and the macroeconomics indicators are first decomposed into ”trend components” (scaling coefficients) and ”volatility components” (wavelet component). Then, with the concept of multi-resolution representation, we evaluate the correlation coefficients between each sub-band of the stock price and the macro-economic indices. Consequently, the connection between the ”trend-components/volatility-components” of stock price and macro-economic indices could be discussed and thus revealed.Based on our results, the ”trend component” of the Dow Jones Index has significant relations to those of the following six indices: EXYR (Export Annual Growth Rate), CPI (Consumer Price Index), DUOR (Durable Goods Orders), M1YR (M1 Annual Growth Rate), NFE (Non-Farm Employment) and PSR (Personal Savings Rate). Meanwhile, the ”volatility component” of the Dow Jones Index is connected to those of the CCI (Consumer Confidence Index) and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure).

The equilibrium concept we use is that of Bayesian-Nash equilibrium. Based on the recognition of the ”aggregative structure” within Cournot competition in which each firm's payoff is determined by its own strategy choice and the un-weighted sum of all firms' strategy choices, we are able to characterize the equilibria in a very simple way. We show that when we consider not the best response but the strategy consistent with a Nash equilibrium in which the aggregate strategy of all players take same value (which is given by what we call the replacement function), then Nash equilibria correspond to fixed points of the aggregate replacement function whose properties we can certainly obtain without need for restricting our attention to symmetric games or games in which there are just 2 players. We develop sufficient conditions under which there is a unique equilibrium.

Based on three hypotheses and data in the 2002 policy year, this study finds that (1) premium expenditures can be saved for most of the claimed policies when drivers are not policyholders; (2) the age difference between policyholders and drivers displays a distribution with two peaks, representing the age discrepancies for husband-wife and parent-child relationships, respectively consistent with age patterns provided by government; (3) the average loss frequency of policies when drivers are not policyholders is higher than that when drivers and policyholders are the same person, indicating that the risk of insurance policies without driver restriction is underestimated. This research confirms that the insurance policies without driver restriction induce a special form of moral hazard in Taiwan automobile insurance market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201012-201101210044-201101210044-619-659,38.4,2010,Academia Economic Papers
Mean Reversion of Short-Term Nominal Interest Rates in Emerging Countries,"Shu-Hwa Chang, Tsung-Wu Ho, Pei-Ling Chen","Nominal interest rates, Panel unit root tests, Cross-sectional dependency, Instrument generating functions, Common factor method","This paper investigates the stochastic properties of short-term nominal interest rates for several emerging countries, and the OECD is a benchmark for comparisons. For that purpose, we employ univariate unit root tests as well as panel unit root tests. Empirical results indicate that univariate unit root tests fail to reject the unit root null at conventional levels; however, the panel test proposed by lm et al. (2003) rejects the unit root null. Because unaccounted cross-sectional dependency may cause a serious over-size problem, we first carry out a formal test for the presence of cross-dependency and, to account for cross-sectional dependency we employ the two panel unit root tests which explicitly allow for cross-sectional dependency: the instrument generating function method developed by Chang (2002) and common factor method proposed by Pesaran (2007). For emerging countries, we find overwhelming evidence that rejects the unit root null, favoring the notion that some countries are mean reverting. Evidence of mean reversion indicates that, instead of VECM-based models, VAR in levels is more appropriate for interest rates modeling (Wu and Chen, 2001). In terms of policy implications, the stationarity of interest rates is consistent with uncovered interest parity (UIP), which implies that a central bank's ability to determine national interest rates will be restricted by the international flows of capital.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201012-201101210044-201101210044-661-696,38.4,2010,Academia Economic Papers
Sovereign Ratings and International Momentum Strategies,Hsien-Yi Chen,"Sovereign ratings, International momentum strategies, Country risk","This paper examines the profitability of momentum strategies based on sovereign ratings in several international equity markets. Recent several papers have indicated that business cycle is proposed as a possible explanation of price momentum. A sovereign credit rating reflects the rating agency’s opinion on the ability and willingness of sovereign governments to service their outstanding financial obligations in full and on time. An important difference between sovereign credit ratings and business cycle variables is that the former in the description international capital market risk conditions is more complete also multi-dimensional. We use a composite risk rating compiled by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG), which is the only international rating agency to provide detailed and consistent monthly data over an extended period for a large number of countries. Furthermore, using stock return data from 21 developed and 18 emerging markets over the January 1998 to May 2005 period, we find that momentum profits are negatively correlated with the country-risk measures and generally fall in response to a lower composite risk ratings score. Specially, this evidence is more pronounced in emerging markets and Asian countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201009-201010260001-201010260001-329-364,38.3,2010,Academia Economic Papers
Feedback Effect and Excess Volatility with Learning,Ming-Chun Hung,"Learning, Excess volatility, Coordination incentives, Global game, Feedback effect","We set out in this study to analyze learning with regard to both fundamentals and observations on asset prices and aggregate investment, explicitly linking this to the dual endogeneity in an investment model, and then discussing the effects of both feedback and coordination incentives on excess volatility and certain investment phenomena. A notable finding is that, regardless of whether or not learning is evident, the coordination incentives amongst agents may well result from the feedback effect; indeed, the stronger the effect of feedback, the higher the coordination incentives. Alternatively, with high liquidity in the financial market, or with the occurrence of substantial shocks, the coordination incentives amongst agents are found to decline under learning, whereas under no learning, they are fixed. Although there is an increase in excess asset price volatility with both the feedback effect and coordination incentives, there is a decrease with the mass of investing firms. At the same time, learning relating to prices is found to amplify the excess asset price volatility more than no learning, whilst learning relating to aggregate investment also increases the excess asset price volatility more than no learning.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201009-201010260001-201010260001-365-412,38.3,2010,Academia Economic Papers
Limited Attention and Annual Earnings Announcements,"Chen-Hui Wu, Chin-Shun Wu, Victor W. Liu","Behavioral finance, Information technology, Limited attention","This paper examines market responses at different times of annual earnings announcements in Taiwan. Since accounting information is available on the Internet at almost no cost, we argue that there is still a cost of limited attention to investors. The empirical results show that the unexpected return changes at the outset of the earnings announcements season are insignificant. As the filings of annual reports intensify, investors become attentive to the massive earnings news and trade accordingly with an increase in unexpected return changes, culminating at the end of the earnings announcement season. We find a significant decrease in trading volume for good news and bad news announced after the statutory due date, which does not necessarily imply investor inattention since a consensus in the market decreases trading volume. We end by examining the trading activity of different types of investors during the earnings filing period. Overall, our findings suggest that the attention allocation by investors is not homogeneous during annual earnings announcements and support the hypothesis of limited attention.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201009-201010260001-201010260001-413-457,38.3,2010,Academia Economic Papers
The Mutual Fund Advertisement Effect and the Purchase and Redemption Flows,"Ying-Fen Fu, Hsin-Hong Kang, Hai-Ching Liu","Fund advertisement, Bull market, Bear market, Purchase rate, Redemption rate","This study examines the influence of various print ad strategies of mutual funds on the investment behavior of fund investors. Past literature has never employed a sample of Taiwan's fund's print advertisements to investigate the effect of fund advertisement. This study examines many issues which were not investigated before. Our study is related to the behavioral finance. When the fund investors are attracted by the fund ads, they pay less attention to risk. The reason may come from the emphasis on performance by most of the fund ads. Thus investors are focused on the past performance, making them ignorant of risk. Moreover, ad frequency is an important strategy of fund print ads. It is better for fund companies to place the advertisement many times than to have their fund ads printed on the front page of the newspaper. Even though the advertisement size is not large, the repeated ads stimulate investors to invest in the advertisement funds. The results show that no matter whether in bull or bear markets, fund advertisements have significantly positive influence on fund flows. However, we should consider the purchase and redemption rates simultaneously to clarify the purchase and redemption decision differences when investors decide to make a transaction on advertised funds.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201009-201010260001-201010260001-459-502,38.3,2010,Academia Economic Papers

Given the limitation in risk sharing and information opacity, Taiwan's stock market provides an ideal setting to test this issue relative to U.S. and other developed markets. We find that idiosyncratic risks estimated using the past one month of daily data do not follow a random walk process and are unrelated to stock returns. However, we find a significantly positive relation between idiosyncratic risks estimated from the EGARCH model using the full sample of the monthly data and expected returns.

Pricing Survivor Swaps with Mortality Jumps and Default Risk,"Chuang-Chang Chang, Chih-Chan Chen, Min-Hung Tsay","Survivor swaps, Mortality derivatives, Default risk, Wang transform, Mortality jumps","A survivor swap refers to an agreement for the future exchange of cash flows based upon a mortality-dependent index. Pricing survivor swaps involves the determination of a fixed proportional premium, π, which results in an initial zero value of the swaps for each party. In order to provide a precise valuation of a mortality derivative, such as a survivor swap, an appropriate model is necessary for the forecasting of the mortality rate. The model proposed for use in this study extends the model provided by Cox et al. (2006) by simultaneously considering mortality jumps and default risk. Using this extended model to price survivor swaps in this study, we mainly find from our simulated results, based upon the data collected, that the survivor swap premium has a positive correlation with both the market price of risk and the frequency of jumps. Furthermore, we find that a stronger jump frequency will enhance the effects of the market price of risk on the premium. On the other hand, the survivor swap premium is also found to have a positive correlation with the market price of risk and the frequency of jumps at any level of default risk. However, when the market price of risk and jump frequency levels are both fixed, a higher (lower) default risk will imply a lower (higher) premium.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201006-201009170155-201009170155-119-156,38.2,2010,Academia Economic Papers

In our model, trading volume can provide additional information which cannot be deduced by price. Specifically, we show that traders can deduce the proportion of the informed traders and the value of the private signal from observing both the price change and trading volume. Technical analysis is proved to be a valuable tool to the uninformed traders. It can help them predict the value of assets, especially that of the volatile assets, more accurately.

(1997) model by allowing for managerial ownership and insider trading. It is shown that optimal ownership structure is increasing in the managerial ownership due to a decrease in the manager's opportunity cost when being overruled by large shareholders. Consequently, a larger managerial ownership increases the monitoring by large shareholders, the manager's effort, and the value of the firm. We also argue that insider trading comes with costs but also with benefits. On the one hand, if allowing to insider trading, a manager inclined to undertake those projects with higher risk. Furthermore, insider trading will hurt outside shareholders and finally reduce the firm's value. On the other hand, allowing the manager to trade in the stock market can induce his managerial effort and reconcile the conflict of interests between manager and large shareholders. It is revealed that positive effects overweight negative effects towards the firm's value when the manager's private benefit is relatively small.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201006-201009170155-201009170155-245-291,38.2,2010,Academia Economic Papers

We find that a management's choice of stock dividends by transferring retained earnings to the share capital signals private information about the firm's good prospect; while a manager's choice of stock dividends by transferring capital surplus to the share capital is an attempt to cater to investors or boost short-term stock prices. We also show that firms with stock dividends from retained earnings exhibit significantly better long-term operating performance than those with stock dividends from capital surplus. These results are consistent with the signaling/retained earnings hypotheses. In addition, investors cannot distinguish between ”melons” and ”lemons” in terms of different distributions of stock dividends, firms with better corporate governance are always valued positively, however.

A panel data set of 118 countries from 1973 to 2007 was employed. The empirical result shows a negative relation-ship between openness and inflation due to the time inconsistency problem of discretionary monetary policy. The negative relationship is significant and strong for countries with high inflation and is insignificant and weak for countries with low inflation. This provides empirical evidence that the time inconsistency problem is greater for countries with high inflation and lesser for countries with low inflation. Furthermore, the results were robust for all countries after controlling for exchange-rate regime and for non-OECD countries.

The Optimal Privatization Policy in the Presence of Environmental Damage,"Chia-Chi Wang, Jiunn-Rong Chiou","Mixed oligopoly, Privatization, Environmental pollution","This paper analyzes the optimal privatization policy for a public firm given that environmental pollution will emerge during the production process. We consider a mixed oligopoly where a public firm and a private firm engage in Cournot competition. We find that if pollution accompanies the production process, in contrast to the conventional wisdom, privatization may not decrease the output of the privatized public firm. Furthermore, whether privatization will improve environmental quality is ambiguous. It will make the environment worse off (better off) if the marginal environmental damage of production is large (small). In addition, the optimal degree of privatization is independent of the marginal damage of pollutant if the environmental damage function is linear. The optimal degree of privatization will be larger (smaller) than that without pollution if the environmental damage function is convex (concave).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-201003-201004160001-201004160001-61-84,38.1,2010,Academia Economic Papers

In the regression framework, we control for three important asset-pricing factors, namely the market excess returns, and Fama and French's (1993) two factors constructed on firm-size and book-to market ratio. Due to possible biases generated from the collinearity existing between the market excess return and the interest rate change, we replace the market excess return by the orthogonalized market factor. Furthermore, considering the time-varying nature of the empirical equity duration, we also test for the most recent break point of the regression relationship by the reversed ordered Cusum test proposed by Pesaran and Timmermann (2002), and propose a most up-to-date estimate of empirical equity duration.

Several results are obtained. Within the sample period, on average, TFP dropped by 2.24% each year. The decline in TFP mainly came from the deterioration in pure technical efficiency (-0.97%), the deterioration in output combination (-0.79%), and the deterioration in scale efficiency (-0.39%). There were significant variations in technology but with slightly positive net growth (0.20%). Technological changes and efficiency changes were mostly negatively related.

However, when the final good's firm is a drastic innovation firm, the equilibrium intermediate goods’ price under licensing would be higher than that under non-licensing.

Firstly, different patent-policy instruments have different effects on R&D and growth. Secondly, there is empirical evidence supporting a positive relationship between IPR protection and innovation, but the evidence is stronger for developed countries than for developing countries. Thirdly, the optimal level of IPR protection should tradeoff the social benefits of enhanced innovation against the social costs of multiple distortions and income inequality.

This paper uses data from the 2003-2004 and 2006-2007 Manpower Utilization Survey and conducts differences-indifferences estimation to investigate the impact of the new labor pension scheme on workers' wages. The results show that the new scheme reduces workers' wages by about 5.92%, which is close to the compulsory rate of 6% paid by employers. Our analyses show that employers may fully shift the cost of the pension to employees.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200909-37-3-339-368-a,37.3,2009,Academia Economic Papers
The Performance of Bank Privatization: The Application of the Matching Theory,"Chung-Hua Shen, Chih-Yung Lin","CAMEL, Bank privatization, CAMEL model, Matching theories, The development degree of countries","This paper compares the performance of bank privatization using privatized banks from 43 countries ranging 1992-2007. We use the CAMEL model, which is used by the Uniform Financial Institution Rating System, to examine the performance of the bank. This paper uses four matching methods to search for controlled banks with similar characteristic variables in the same countries. Then this study proposes five issues to investigate whether the performance of banks can be improved after privatization. First, the performance of banks can be improved after privatization in capital, asset, management and earnings indices. Next, the long-term privatization effect outperforms the short-term privatization effect, but only for management and earnings indices. Third, there is only a partial privatization effect in full privatization, but not for partial privatization. Fourth, both types of privatization are only effective for management and earnings indices. Last, privatization effects are only effective in low and middle development countries, but not in high development countries. Overall, our results show that the privatization of banks can only partially improve performance in some cases. So we consider the privatization effect obviously affected by the time, the percent of privatization, the type of privatization and the development degree of countries. Hence, the performance of banks is not always improved after privatization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200909-37-3-369-405-a,37.3,2009,Academia Economic Papers
The Operational Risks in Banks' Wealth Management Services: A Perspective from the Credit Crisis of Structured Notes,Yong-Chin Liu,"Operational risk, Reputational risk, Event study method, Wealth management services, Structured notes","This paper investigates the impact of reputational risk (belonging to operational risks) of wealth management services (WMS) on market values (stock prices) in Taiwan's banks from the internal fraud of Societe Generale, financial crisis of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., and declaration of government's handling measures. When the issuing or guaranteeing institutions of structured notes have credit crises, banks offering WMS suffer from reputational risks because their clients make losses on their investment in structured notes, and thus ascribe the blame to their improper marketing. Using various event studies and a cross-sectional regression, I find that on average Taiwanese banks have significantly negative abnormal returns on stocks around the periods of the three above-mentioned events. For the Lehman Brothers event, these negative returns can not be completely explained by securities investment losses of bank themselves or decreased expected income from WMS, and, therefore, are related to the extent of development of WMS. The higher the development of WMS, the larger the negative abnormal returns due to higher reputational risks, which is also supported by evidence from examining stock returns around the period of the government's actions to safeguard investors. Thus, banks engaging in WMS are likely to undergo reputational risks and a decline in market value.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200906-200907230044-200907230044-137-171,37.2,2009,Academia Economic Papers

Since suppliers are better at performing tasks than final producers, outsourcing increases firm productivity However, integration costs which increase with outsourced tasks and decrease with firms' capability are required for outsourcing. This model shows that trade liberalization affects firms with different capability levels differently. Firms with higher capability enlarge the set of outsourced tasks in response to tougher competition, while those with lower capability cut their proportion of outsourced inputs. Furthermore, improvements in suppliers' technology definitely benefit firms with higher capability. Finally, radical progress in integration technology facilitates outsourcing of all firms by increasing the fraction of tasks produced by suppliers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200906-200907230044-200907230044-173-205,37.2,2009,Academia Economic Papers

We find that higher bearing costs will lower the fertility rate, but they might raise the output growth rate. On the other hand, the effects of birth allowance on fertility and economic growth are theoretically ambiguous. We also find that a stronger status- seeking motive will reduce the fertility rate since it leads to resources reallocation towards status goods. This result may explain why the fertility rates in developed countries are lower. Moreover, whether agents' status-seeking behavior stimulates economic growth or not depends on the nature of status goods. If status goods are wealth-oriented, the output growth rate will be higher because of stimulated capital accumulation. By contrast, slower economic growth results if the status good is consumption-oriented. This finding may explain the different growth experiences between U.S. and Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200906-200907230044-200907230044-253-281,37.2,2009,Academia Economic Papers
"The Optimal Entry Mode of the Multinational Firm: Direct Investment, Export, and Licensing","Yi-Jen Tsai, Jiunn-Rong Chiou","Entry mode, Direct investment, Export, Licensing","When a technology-superior multinational firm intends to enter a new market, three possible entry types, export, direct investment, and licensing, are usually under consideration. In this paper, we analyze the optimal decision on the entry mode by the multinational firm. We focus on the royalty licensing style. The main findings are as follows. Royalty licensing become a possible strategy of the multinational firm when trade barriers exist. Export is the only possible strategy if the tariff is low enough. The cost gap between the multinational firm and the host country's firm plays an important role when the tariff is relatively high. The multinational firm will adopt the licensing mode if the cost differentiation is relatively small, but will invest directly if the cost gap is large. When the cost gap shrinks, the direct investment strategy may switch to the licensing one with a larger tariff, and switch to export if the tariff is low. The optimal decision of the multinational firm matches the host country's preference only when the tariff is quite high or quite low.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200903-37-1-1-26-a,37.1,2009,Academia Economic Papers

An Examination of Banks' Efficiency for Six Asian Countries Using the Metafrontier Cost Function,"Tai-Hsin Huang, Bao-Guang Chang, Yu-Fang Chiu","Meta cost function, Technology gap, Scale economies, Scope economies","During the Asian financial turmoil, many Asian countries were heavily hit. To investigate whether the production efficiency of the banks in this area has been enhanced after the financial crisis, we use the stochastic frontier approach along with a meta-cost function model to estimate their technical efficiency. The meta-cost frontier model enables the calculation of relative technical efficiencies for banks operating under different technologies and of the technology gaps. We collect data from Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan for empirical study. Evidence is found that Japan has the best level of production technology. On average, sample banks can reduce their current expenditure by up to 15.3% to 43.2% in order to produce the same amount of outputs, if they adopt the best technique to produce the outputs.

To enhance competitiveness, the government is decreasing bank competition by raising concentration of banking. This paper examines the impact of bank concentration on bank risk and explores the relationship between bank concentration, bank competition and bank risk in the Taiwan's banking industry from 1996 to 2005. This paper uses the Lerner Index to measure bank competition and applies the fixed effects two-stage least squares technique in the method of estimation.

Input Price Contracts and Strategic Delegation with Downstream Duopoly,Pei-Cheng Liao,"Floating price contract, Fixed price contract, Strategic delegation, Managerial incentive scheme","This paper examines how input price contracts by an upstream monopolist affect the incentive schemes that owners of downstream duopolists offer their managers. In the Cournot case, under a floating price contract in which the upstream supplier chooses the input prices after the managerial incentive schemes are made, the owners of the downstream firms compensate their managers for profits while penalizing them for sales. Conversely, a fixed price contract (where the input prices remain unchanged following the downstream delegation decisions) leads to more aggressive managerial behavior and higher market output, thereby benefiting the monopoly supplier. Similar results are obtained for the Bertrand case wherein the owners of the downstream firms direct their managers toward a more aggressive behavior under a fixed price contract than under a floating price contract. The supplier always prefers a fixed price contract to a floating price contract.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200812-36-4-387-404-a,36.4,2008,Academia Economic Papers

Furthermore, we show that the conventional result of central agglomeration equilibrium is indeed a special case of ours, due to its assumption of higher market size than the threshold.

This leads to a dynamic panel data cost model, which can be used to estimate and to compare the production efficiency, adjustment speeds toward long-run steady state, and scale and scope economies for the commercial banks of West and East European countries.

The empirical evidence reveals that some characteristics of the claimants who file the claims in the last policy month are different from that of those who file claims in the alternative months.

Does Corporate Social Responsibility Improve Financial Performance? Evidence from Ftse4good UK Index,"Chung-Hua Shen, Yuan Chang","Corporate social responsibility, Selection bias, Matching method","In this paper, we examine the effect of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) on firm financial performance (CSR-effect). Two competing hypotheses, social impact hypothesis and shift of focus hypothesis, are proposed to investigate this issue; the former suggests that CSR has a positive relation with performance and the latter the opposite. To ensure the CSR-effect is not contaminated by other factors and to ensure the sample is randomly drawn, we employ four matching methods, Nearest, Caliper, Mahala and Mahala Caliper to match the characteristics of the firms with CSR (CSR-firms) and without CSR (NonCSR-firms). Although the four methods yield slightly different results, to our surprise, firms engaging in CSR activities obtain lower values on the return on assets, return on equity, return on sales and earnings per share. Therefore, CSR at the very least does not improve the firm performance, supporting the shift of focus hypothesis.

A Risk Analysis of Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance: An Application of Malmquist Productivity Index,"Hsueh-Ping Wang, Tsung-Min Hsieh, Ching-Cheng Chang, Yir-Hueih Luh, Shih-Hsun Hsu","Compulsory automobile liability insurance, Data envelopment analysis, Malmquist index, Risk assessment","The compulsory automobile liability insurance is a mandatory government program in which all automobile owners are required to buy the policy under the no fault liability principle. The premiums are based on the goal of ”zero-profit-zero-loss” by spreading the risks among domestic co-insurers. Most literature evaluates the fairness of the premiums based on either the personal or vehicle factors, without due consideration of the dynamic relationship among various sources of risks and premium payments. This study integrates the concept of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and mean-variance portfolio frontier into a distance-function-based premium-indemnity efficient frontier. Premium (the insurance cost) is treated as an input while indemnity (the risk coverage) is treated as an output for each vehicle type. The efficient frontier is established to select the most preferred premium-indemnity combination among its boundary points by either maximizing total indemnities under given premiums or minimizing total premiums under given indemnities. The Malmquist index decomposition is then adopted to decompose the changes of total risks across two periods into the vehicle risk and travel risk components. The vehicle risk component measures the efficiency changes of the premium-indemnity combination and represents how much the risk coverage can be increased without changing the premium or how much the premium can be reduced without affecting the coverage. It can be further decomposed into changes of pure vehicle risk and scale risk. The empirical results indicate that the vehicle risk has increased over the past five years due to the sharp increase of scale risk, but travel risk has decreased at the same time due to better enforcement of safe driving habits. Therefore, a coupling of lower indemnity with higher fuel tax to reduce travel intensity is proposed as a policy solution to improve the efficiency of the compulsory insurance program.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200806-36-2-195-220-a,36.2,2008,Academia Economic Papers
Estimating Cost Efficiency in Taiwanese Banking Adjusting Loan Loss Provision,"Chung-Hua Shen, Ting-Hsuan Chen","Bank cost efficiency, Economic provision for loan loss","This paper investigates the cost efficiency of Taiwan's banks by redefining the ”reported cost”. We argue that because the reported PLL is an accrual item, it fluctuates significantly over time, making the cost also fluctuate. Furthermore, the provision is often decided in a discretionary manner, which is affected by the forbearance policy, sudden regulation changes and more. As a result, reported cost is notorious for its discretionary characteristics.
We propose an approach to reduce the fluctuation of reported PLL to the minimum and at the same time fulfill the economic meaning of PLL. That is, we suggest an ”economic PLL” to replace the reported PLL to be included in the cost. We found that economic PLL differs substantially from reported PLL. For example, the cost of Chang-Hwa Bank has risen steadily from 19,107 million New Taiwan dollars to 41,389 million New Taiwan dollars, and cost efficiency has degraded from rank 5th to rank 22 th. Results are also consistent with our intuition that the improper estimation of reported cost because of PLL discretion may cause the bias of cost efficiency. Finally, we further specify optimal scale economic as the basis of improving cost efficiency in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200806-36-2-221-247-a,36.2,2008,Academia Economic Papers

Some firms might expand employment, but mainly at the cost of crowding out employment in other firms. Hence, critics expect that marginal subsidies are equivalent to general subsidies and create large fiscal costs without much gain in employment. We develop a model that specifically focuses on the displacement effects of marginal wage subsidies. Our results show that marginal subsidies generally create larger output and employment effects and are fiscally more efficient than general subsidies despite their between-firm displacement effects.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200803-36-1-1-23-a,36.1,2008,Academia Economic Papers

We found that divisionalization aggravates the problem of SICM, suggesting that U-form (undivisionalized) organizations can outperform M-form (divisionalized) organizations-a result that is in contrast to Williamson's ”M-form hypothesis.” In addition, the SICM problem for a given divisionalized firm can be alleviated by redirecting more managerial ownership from high-tier managers to low-tier managers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200803-36-1-25-52-a,36.1,2008,Academia Economic Papers
"Biased Growth, Relative Prices, and Employment: A Specific-Factor Efficiency Wage Model",Tien-Wang Tsaur,"Growth, Relative prices, Unemployment, Specific factors, Efficiency wage","This paper incorporates the efficiency wage hypothesis into a specific-factor two sector (tradable and non-tradable goods) model to investigate the effects of growth in each sector on the relative prices of commodities, the employment of labor, and the balance of payments. The derived two-commodity supply functions show that the specific factor growth in one sector at constant commodity prices leads to a proportional expansion of its own output only, and has no effect on the output of the other sector. Moreover, an increase in the mobile factor (labor) would just raise the unemployment rate in the economy, exerting no influence on the output produced and the labor employed in each sector. Due to the real-wage (defined by the consumer price index) rigidity of the efficiency wage model, these results apparently differ from the standard conclusions based on the conventional Heckscher-Ohlin model or specific-factor model. It is also shown that the relative commodity prices and the specific factor quantities are two crucial determents in influencing intersectoral wage differentials, which, in turn, play an important role in determining the quantities of the labor available for employment in traded and non-traded sectors. In addition, both impact effects and dynamic paths of labor employment depend on the growth patterns, the substitutability between labor and specific factors, the expenditure shares of traded and non-traded goods, the factor-income shares, and the magnitude of relevant parameters.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200803-36-1-53-87-a,36.1,2008,Academia Economic Papers

Household data are used to examine how new-house price risk influences the expected return of value stocks.

Whereas the Byrd Amendment had been the subject of a dispute between the U.S. and several WTO member countries, many trade theorists paradoxically found the Byrd Amendment can yield lower duties and greater import volume than in its absence, thereby benefitting not only the home firms but also the foreign firms. On the contrary, this paper shows that the Byrd Amendment provides an incentive for domestic firms to adjust sales so as to shift the dumping margin in its favor. The outcome is that the foreign firms are more likely to be found guilty of dumping, and the resultant level of antidumping duty becomes higher after the presence of the Byrd Amendment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200712-35-4-381-410-a,35.4,2007,Academia Economic Papers

It is found that IPRP contributes a positive effect on the balanced growth rate of the economy if the probability of death and birth is small enough, but it reduces the balanced growth rate of the economy if the probability of death and birth is relatively large. It is also found that R&DS boosts the balanced economic growth rate regardless of whether the probability of death and birth is large or small. Consequently, for the sake of stimulating the economy's growth rate, R&DS is generally superior to IPRP.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200712-35-4-411-438-a,35.4,2007,Academia Economic Papers
Asymmetry in Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Taiwan Import Prices: The Potential Role of Menu Costs,"En-En Huang, Ching-Yu Lan, Biing-Shen Kuo","Asymmetry, Exchange rate pass-through, Menu cost, Threshold regression model","This study investigates whether there is an asymmetry in exchange rate pass-through using threshold regression technique. We found significant evidence for the pass-through effect only when the changes in exchange rates are smaller than 3%. The asymmetry is consistent with the predictions from a simple theory where altering prices to accommodate exchange rate fluctuations by exporters may incur fixed menu cost. Hence, despite a loss in competitiveness, exporters tend to maintain their exporting prices when the degrees of exchange rate movements are mild, resulting in the observed exchange rate pass-through.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200712-35-4-439-472-a,35.4,2007,Academia Economic Papers
Counterfactual Decomposition of Public-Private Sector Wage Differentials in Taiwan: Evidence from Quantile Regression,Chien-Liang Chen,"Public-private sector, Wage premium, Quantile regression, Counterfactual decomposition","Specifying selectivity of labor force participation and endogeneity of sectoral choice, this study estimates the wage premium for Taiwan's public sector versus private sector over the past 25 years. In the context of counterfactual decomposition based on quantile regression and bootstrapping, estimations of this study account for both the heterogeneous marginal rate of return across wage distribution and the different distributions of covariates between the two sectors. The empirical results show that public sector wage premium was largely negative for top skilled workers in 1980, while it fluctuated between positive and negative ranges for medium-and-above skilled workers during the 80s and the 90s. For unskilled public sector workers, a positive wage premium has existed since the 80s and sharply increased in recent years. Applying quantile regression to counterfactual decomposition, this study provides new evidence on Taiwan's public sector wage premium which differs from the results of previous literature.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200712-35-4-473-520-a,35.4,2007,Academia Economic Papers
Policy Externalities and Optimal Exchange Rate Regimes,Wing Leong Teo,"Policy externalities, Exchange rate regimes, Dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, Second order approximation","In this paper, I explore the welfare implications of a small country's exchange rate regime, for the small country itself, as well as for a large country, the currency of which the small country potentially pegs to. A two-country dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model is developed for the analysis. Floating exchange rate regimes are modeled as Taylortype interest rate rules, with different feedback coefficients on inflation and output. I show that, compared to a fixed exchange rate regime, both countries will be worse off if the small country adopts an interest rate rule with a large feedback coefficient on output and a small feedback coefficient on inflation. I also show that it is important for the small country not to respond to output fluctuations in its interest rate rule, as it will generate costly fluctuations of inflation. On the other hand, holding the feedback coefficient on output at zero, the feedback coefficient on inflation matters very little for the welfare of the small country, as long as it is greater than 1 to guarantee uniqueness of equilibrium.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200709-35-3-255-289-a,35.3,2007,Academia Economic Papers
Optimal Contract for Ambitious Team Workers,"Kong-Pin Chen, Tsung-Sheng Tsai","Relative performance, Absolute performance, Promotion tournament, Wage contract","This paper investigates the optimal compensation scheme for workers in a team who value not only absolute but also relative incomes. A worker is said to be more ambitious if his utility places more weight on relative income. In this case, the firm can exploit the worker's preference for relative comparison to design a compensation scheme which induces the same effort level with lower cost. Under the optimal compensation scheme, the workers' wages are shown to depend on relative performance, and exhibit wage compression. More importantly, even if the production technology calls for absolute performance evaluation in the traditional principal-agent model, the optimal wage structure still relies on relative performance. Finally, in contrast to past literature, worker heterogeneity is shown to reduce the firm's profit.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200709-35-3-291-313-a,35.3,2007,Academia Economic Papers
A Cobweb Theory of House Price Incorporating Investor Behavior,"Ming-Chi Chen, I-Chun Tsai","Cobweb theory, Markov-switching, Error-correction, House prices, Anticipation","This study analyzes house price fluctuations by incorporating investor anticipation based on cobweb theory. We theoretically explain that investor anticipation affects housing demand and further affects the house price equilibrium state. The booms and slumps of house prices could be caused by changes of investor anticipation. Therefore it is important to consider changes of these two regimes when estimating house prices and this is the reason we use the regime-switching error-correction model in house price estimation. In the empirical test, structural change indeed exists when the house price is adjusting to an equilibrium level. Our switching error-correction model estimates the probabilities of two regimes for house prices and observes the timings of house price deviation from equilibrium. Finally, we estimate the expected coefficient of adjustment and find that when the coefficient is relatively large, house prices are more stable. From our theory inference and empirical results, we conclude that when the expected coefficient of adjustment is larger, the demand slope will be smoother. Consequently, house prices tend to converge to a steady state level so that the housing market is more stable.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200709-35-3-315-344-a,35.3,2007,Academia Economic Papers

The Welfare Effects on Income Tax Deduction Policy for Losses,"Tsaur-Chin Wu, K. L. Glen Ueng","Income tax deduction policy for losses, Income redistribution, Risk taking","Under the assumption of identical insurees, Kaplow (1992, AER) shows that income tax deduction will induce insurees to buy partial insurance, which in turn distorts their insurance decision. Thus welfare with deduction will be lower than without deduction. This paper extends the setting of Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) and constructs a three-stage game which consists of the government, insurers and insurees to study the welfare effects on income tax deduction policy for losses. It is shown in this extended model that: (1) if there exists a critical value for the marginal tax rate such that high-risk insurees do not insure, then the insurance market cannot exist in equilibrium, and (2) the choice of loss deduction policy involves three kinds of effects: the income redistribution effect; and the risk-taking effects for high-risk and low-risk insurees. If the three kinds of effects are positive in aggregate, then welfare with deduction will be higher than without deduction. However, when an insurance market exists, we show that welfare effects with deduction are negative mostly from numerical examples, but welfare effects will be improved when no insurance market exists.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200706-35-2-115-148-a,35.2,2007,Academia Economic Papers

It is found that foreign monetary disturbances do not affect real variables (e.g., national income and interest rate) of the home country in the long run, while the effect of external monetary shocks on the national income of the home country will lessen when the international labor mobility is larger. Under perfect international labor mobility, the small open economy will be insulated from monetary disturbances originated in the rest of the world. However, the small country will be affected by external fiscal disturbances in both the long- and short-run. This implies that the home country can deregulate on labor control internationally in order to minimize the impact from foreign economic shocks.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200706-35-2-149-180-a,35.2,2007,Academia Economic Papers
"Bounded Rationality, Profit Opportunities and the Oscillation Pattern of Business Cycle",Chih-Huan Chen,"Cyclical asymmetry, Investment myopia, Bounded rationality","This paper develops a nonlinear dynamic model of business cycles to investigate the possible links between technological breakthroughs, investment myopia and business cycles. The modeling is based upon Lotka-Volterra differential equations to capture an inherent mechanism of business cycles. The mechanism is initiated by technological breakthroughs and clustered innovation that generates enormous profit opportunities for investment and thereby triggers an expansion of output. However, the improved profitability carries the seed of its own destruction by engendering an excessively vigorous expansion of investment. Once profit opportunities decrease to a critical level, the economy cannot sustain itself any more and drop subsequently, causing the onset of recession. This endogenous force intertwining with the exogenous force of technological progress generates cyclical fluctuations in economic activity. In the model, the cyclical pattern of the economy is hinged on the growth pattern of profit opportunities. The oscillation of the economy is constant in amplitude as profit opportunities grow at a constant rate, and dies off gradually as the growth of profit opportunities follows a logistic growth pattern. In addition, this model gives a convincing explanation for the phenomenon of cyclical asymmetry by incorporating the fact of accelerating technological progress.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200706-35-2-181-209-a,35.2,2007,Academia Economic Papers
A Mixed Financing System for Medical Expenditures: The Combination of Medical Saving Accounts and National Health Insurance,Yi-Chen Hong,"Medical saving accounts, Health insurance, Deductible, Coinsurance rate","This paper analyzes the systems of national health insurance and medical saving accounts, and discusses a mixed financing system for medical expenditures, which combines these two systems. The results indicate that health insurance with deductibles could provide protection against the risk of severe diseases and match the insured's preference for health insurance. Also, deposits of medical saving accounts could cover the illness risk. That is why a mixed financing system, combining medical saving accounts and health insurance with deductible, could provide better protection against illness risk than any individual system such as national health insurance or medical saving accounts. Under the mixed system, the national health insurance covers the medical expenditures exceeding deductibles, and medical saving accounts finance the deductibles.

The Impacts of Health Effects on Optimal Environmental Taxes,"Arwin Pang, Daigee Shaw","Optimal environmental tax, Double dividend, Health, Tax interaction","There are three articles (Schwartz and Repetto, 2000; Williams, 2002, 2003) that have introduced health effects into the tax-interaction effect in the green tax reform literature and examined their impacts on the optimal environmental taxes. While the health effect is implicitly represented in the utility function in Schwartz and Repetto (2000), it is explicitly modeled using a sickness function in Williams (2002, 2003) and a health production function in Williams (2003). In Williams' (2003) model, sickness enters time constraint and health affects utility function. However, Schwartz and Repetto (2000) and Williams (2003) reach different conclusions. Schwartz and Repetto (2000) suggest the positive impacts of better environmental quality on labor supply will increase welfare and the optimal environmental tax may be larger than the marginal pollution damage. Williams (2003) find that the impact of health effects on welfare is negative and the optimal environmental tax should be less than the marginal pollution damage.
In this paper we argue that the two-function representation of the health effect in Williams (2003) is inappropriate. By introducing a health production function which depends on mitigating activities and environmental quality and affects both the utility and time constraint at the same time in a general equilibrium framework, our model shows that the mitigation-based benefit-side tax-interaction effect emerges. We find that its effect on welfare is positive using a numerical analysis of the model. Thus, contrary to Williams (2003), we conclude that the optimal pollution tax should be larger than the marginal pollution damage after taking the mitigation-based benefit-side tax-interaction effect into consideration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200703-35-1-1-19-a,35.1,2007,Academia Economic Papers

We use a KMV model to link the asset market price and default risk. In addition, we construct a copula function to describe the dependent structure of a collateral portfolio. Under the risk neutral measure, we can obtain the fair premium of different tranches of collateralized debt obligations. The simulation results show that the credit rating, dependent structure and recovery rate of collateral portfolio are important factors affecting the fair premium of different tranches. The ranking and loss of tranches are also important factors for the fair premium. This paper thus provides a useful pricing method for collateralized debt obligations, given the lack of a complete default database in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200703-35-1-21-52-a,35.1,2007,Academia Economic Papers

An imperfectly competitive market structure and a production function with labor and technology in puts are utilized in this paper. The main findings in this paper are as follows. (1) If labor and technology are complementary inputs, the multinational firm will increase its R&D investment as it invests outward. (2) If labor and technology are substitute inputs, the impact of outward direct investment on multinational firm's R&D investment is ambiguous. It is shown that the lower the host country's wage or the larger the market size, the more likely it is that the multinational firm's R&D investment will decrease due to outward direct investment. (3) In the case that a host country's firm also invests in R&D, its R&D investment will decrease while facing foreign direct investment as labor and technology are complementary. On the contrary, as labor and technology are substitutes, the host firm's R&D investment may increase while facing foreign direct investment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200703-35-1-53-82-a,35.1,2007,Academia Economic Papers

The generalized method of moments method has to be applied for obtaining consistent parameter estimates under the framework of dynamic panel data. Evidence is found that an AR (2) specification of technical inefficiency is necessary to whiten the random disturbance of the cost frontier and in turn to solve the problem of endogenous regressors.

The empirical results show that evident heterogeneity exists not only in labor supply selectivity but also in rates of return of worker's characteristics across the conditional distribution of wages. In consequence, gender wage discrimination changes with wage level, while low skilled female workers suffer the most.

Application of the Mover-Stayer Model to Evaluating the Short-Run Performance Persistence of Mutual Funds in Taiwan,"Wei-Yu Kuo, Kai-Li Li","Mutual fund performance persistence, Mover-stayer model","We employ the mover-stayer model developed by Blumen et al. (1955) to study the dynamics of performance persistence of mutual funds in Taiwan. In comparison with the static analysis adopted by the literature, this model provides us with more detailed information about and helps us further understand the nature of mutual fund performance persistence. We also use the maximum likelihood methodology suggested by Frydman (1984) to estimate the mover-stayer model and test the data-fitting ability of this model against that of a pure Markov chain based on the likelihood ratio test. We find that: (1) There exists a certain degree of persistence in mutual fund performance. Such persistence is, however, not very significant. It is because most funds are mover funds with unstable performance rather than stayer funds with consistence performance. More interestingly, funds within the best and the worst performance groups have more persistent performance than those within the middle performance group. This implies that in view of the previous mediocre performance, fund managers within the middle group have strong intention to improve their future performance. Nevertheless, rewards for such intentions are never guaranteed. In addition, the fact that the worst performance group has the highest proportion of stayer funds implies that losers are more persistent than winners in Taiwan's mutual fund industry. Overall, mutual funds in Taiwan have only weak performance persistence. (2) Consistent with the literature, the degree of persistence in performance is dependent on the performance evaluation criteria. It seems that this difference of degree of persistence is reflected in the estimation of stayer fund proportion, not in the estimation of the transition probability matrix of mover funds. (3) There exists survivorship bias in our study. It mainly influences the estimation of stayer funds proportion, not that of the transition probability matrix of mover funds. Having said that, we believe that this bias will not alter the important conclusions of this article. (4) According to the likelihood ratio test, we are able to strongly reject the pure Markov chain model at the 1% significance level. This result supports our application of the mover-stayer model to study the performance persistence of mutual funds in Taiwan. Surely, it will be valuable to apply this model to investigate the same issue in other countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200612-34-4-469-504-a,34.4,2006,Academia Economic Papers
The Effects of Industrial Structure and Sex Discrimination on Changes in Female and Male Wage Differential in Taiwan 1978-2003,"Mei Hsu, Been-Lon Chen, Jiun-Der Fang","Wage differential, Sex discrimination, Industrial structure change, Oaxaca decomposition analysis","Recently, female to male wage differentials have been declining in Taiwan. Two factors may explain the results. First is the change in industrial structure. Second is the increase in female education. The industrial structure in Taiwan has moved toward a level with higher technology- and capital-intensity with a larger share in the tertiary sector, in which females have a comparative advantage. The second factor results in a higher marginal product of female workers. This article employs the Manpower Utilization Survey data in Taiwan during the period of 1978-2003 in order to study the effects of industrial structure and sex discrimination on changes in the male-female wage differential. We test the following two hypotheses.
First, the industrial structure change, resulting from economic growth, narrows the female-male wage differential. Second, the reduction in sex discrimination leads to a smaller female-male wage differential. Our estimations and tests support these two hypotheses. In particular, the factor of the average productivity differentials between females and males, as opposed to the factor of sex discrimination, is increasing over time in the determination of the narrowing female-male wage differential.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200612-34-4-505-539-a,34.4,2006,Academia Economic Papers

In particular, reserving a large percentage of data for the validation purpose is absolutely necessary when developing credit scorecards. Using two additional years of data as the validation sample, we show that our credit scorecards perform much better than the basic credit rating provided by the TEJ in terms of several performance statistics.

In this paper we consider the effects of consumer search in an industry equilibrium when firms advertise their products to attract consumers. Starting with a standard Dixit-Stiglitz style monopolistic competition framework, we assume that the demand for the product of a monopolistic firm depends on the number of consumers who are aware of the existence of the firm as well as prices. Firms advertise their products to attract consumers' attention. We investigate two cases. First, the number of firms a consumer knows depends totally on firms' advertising expenditures. In that case, the monopolistic competition equilibrium advertising expenditure of a representative firm is socially optimal, the same as the results in the literature. Then we study the case when consumers engage in search activities to learn of more firms. In this case, firms spend less than the socially optimal level in an industry equilibrium. We also show that in the short run when the number of firms is fixed, consumers do not get more information when doing a search. However, in the long run equilibrium more firms will enter the industry and consumer welfare increases.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200609-34-3-301-323-a,34.3,2006,Academia Economic Papers

Okun's Law: Empirical Evidence in Taiwan,Ching-Yi Chiang,"Okun's law, Unemployment, Business cycle","This paper examines the validity of Okun's law in Taiwan during 1961 to 1999. Using three detrending methods (first differencing, the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition procedure and the Hodrick-Prescott filter) to decompose variables, we find that there exists a negative relationship between the cyclical output growth and the cyclical unemployment rate. In addition to changes in unemployment rate, changes in capital productivity and labor force are also important variables in explaining changes in output growth; omission of the two variables would cause the estimates of the Okun coefficient to be upwardly biased. Estimates of the Okun coefficient and the stability of Okun's relationship are sensitive to the trend/cycle decomposition. In the first-difference model, the estimate is -2.1 and Okun's relationship is unstable.

We assume that one foreign firm and one domestic firm engage in Cournot competition in the domestic market. The products of two firms can be compatible or incompatible. The main findings are as follows. Firstly, the imposition of import tariffs will decrease the foreign firm's output as indicated in the strategic trade literature. However, when products are compatible and the marginal network externalities are sufficiently large, an import tariff may result in a decrease in domestic output. When products are incompatible, the foreign firm may be forced to exit the market even with a small amount of the tariffs, if the output of the foreign firm is small. Secondly, when products are compatible, a low enough quota may cause the domestic firm not to increase but to decrease its output. When products are incompatible, a quota may be non-binding even though the quota is set below the free trade level. Finally, when products are compatible, the domestic firm may increase its output under the voluntary import expansions (VIEs) policy. When products are incompatible, the domestic firm may be forced to exit the market even with a small amount of VIEs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200606-34-2-161-190-a,34.2,2006,Academia Economic Papers

The latter has caused a huge controversy, and the Legislative Yuan has thus requested the Executive Yuan reform the minimal purchase scheme because it in effect encourages waste of resources, as users tend to use as much as the minimal purchase quantity.

Tax Evasion and Tax Auditing: An Analysis of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Returns,Ming-Chin Chen,"Tax auditing, Tax evasion, Tobit model, Profit-seeking enterprises","To counter potential tax evasion, tax collection authorities have devoted extensive manpower and resources to investigation of tax returns of profit-seeking enterprises. However, the purpose of tax auditing is not to penalize taxpayers engaging in tax evasion but to enhance taxpayers' tax compliance in the future. Yet, evidence on the impact of tax auditing on tax compliance is still very limited. Using 1994 and 1996 tax return data, this study examines the relationship between tax auditing and tax evasion of profit-seeking enterprises. The empirical results show that: (1) tax penalties do have a significant countering effect on tax evasion in the future; (2) discoveries of under-reported income by tax auditing appear to have no effect on reducing future tax evasion; (3) tax auditing conducted by paper reviewing results in less tax-compliance in the future; (4) all else being equal, CPA-attested tax returns are more tax-compliant than non-CPA attested ones. Finally, this paper also provides evidence on the relations between tax evasion and some important characteristics of firms such as tax status, size, leverage, location, and industry membership.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200606-34-2-213-250-a,34.2,2006,Academia Economic Papers
Effects of Deregulation on Bank Efficiency and Productivity in Taiwan,"Vei-Lin Chan, Michael Liu","Technical efficiency, The Malmquist productivity index, Financial deregulation","Taiwan's banking industry has experienced dramatic structural changes since the granting of new banking licenses in 1991. The purpose of this paper is to examine bank efficiency and productivity growth over 1992-2000 that are evaluated using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Our findings are as follows. (1) Technical efficiency for old banks has fallen after 1992, and there is no significant difference between new and old bank technical efficiency over 1992-2000. The random-effects Tobit panel regression results indicate that specialization and investment would benefit new banks. In addition, rising non-performing loans and the Asian financial crisis resulted in a decrease in bank technical efficiency for both new and old banks. (2) In terms of the Malmquist productivity indexes, productivity growth of old banks is higher than that of new banks over 1992-2000. The dynamic panel data regression results indicate that productivity growth exhibits significant negative persistence for both new and old banks. Banking competition and investment benefit new banks. Moreover, non-performing loans and the Asian financial crisis can explain why new banks have a lower productivity growth rate than that of old banks over 1992-2000.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200606-34-2-251-300-a,34.2,2006,Academia Economic Papers
Precautionary Saving and Consumption with Borrowing Constraints,"Ching-Yu Lan, Biing-Shen Kuo","Borrowing constraint, Precautionary saving, Permanent income hypothesis, Excess sensitivity of consumption, Higher-order moments","Using the framework of Dow and Olson (1991), we demonstrate that the presence of the borrowing constraints induces a precautionary motive in response to income uncertainties, even when there has been no such motive inherent in consumers' preference. The corresponding marginal value function now displays a convexity which is responsible for the precautionary motive. The analytical framework allows us to be able to characterize saving behaviors that are of precautionary motives, and their responses to changes in various moments of income process. As to empirical implications, our analysis sheds light on the causes of excess sensitivity, the consequences of sample splitting between the rich and the poor, as well as the relevance of the higher-order moments to consumption dynamics, specifically both the skewness and kurtosis.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200603-34-1-1-39-a,34.1,2006,Academia Economic Papers
On the Regime-Switching Behavior of Taiwan Real GNP Growth Rate,"Yi-Ting Chen, Chih-Sheng Hsieh","Markov Switching autoregressive model, Long-term and short-term regime-switching, Business cycles, Specification test","The location-MSAR models, which impose the Markov chain on the location parameters but not other parameters, are widely used in the empirical studies of business cycles. These simple models are found unable to interpret the business cycles of Taiwan in the long-term, however. By the use of Taiwan real GNP growth rate series, we illustrate that this problem is likely due to two econometric deficiencies of such models: the misspecification of models and the inability to discriminate between the long-term and short-term regime-switching behavior involved in the raw growth rate series. (The long-term effect is driven by economic development and the short-term effect is determined by business cycles.) To circumvent these two deficiencies, we first conduct model specification tests to determine suitable long-term MSAR models for the raw series. Then, we use these long-term models to define a ”segment-standardized” growth rate series that includes only the short-term effect. This segment-standardization may serve as an alternate to the sample-splitting method of Rau et al. (2001, Academia Economic Papers). Finally, we utilize this standardized series to re-estimate a simple location-MSAR model. The empirical study shows that our method is useful for recovering the performance of this simple model on explaining the business cycles of Taiwan in the long-term.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200603-34-1-41-91-a,34.1,2006,Academia Economic Papers

Using the innovative multivariate Student-t GJR GARCH-M with Threshold Conditional Correlation Coefficient model, this paper finds that there exist bi-directional mean spillover effects among SPOT, NDF and DF markets; however, the SPOT market has a more dominant effect on NDF and DF markets than vice versa. Before the Central Bank of Taiwan imposed the restriction on domestic corporations to operate NDF, there was significant asymmetric volatility transmission from the NDF to the SPOT market; nevertheless, the volatility transmission effect turned to insignificance after the Central Bank of Taiwan implemented the restriction policy. The empirical observation provides the evidence that the restriction policy helps to improve the stability of the SPOT market. Furthermore, we found that the correlation coefficient between the SPOT and NDF markets is higher after the restriction policy was implemented. These findings suggest the restriction policy has altered the dynamic relations of return and volatility transmission and correlation coefficient between the SPOT and NDF markets.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200603-34-1-93-126-a,34.1,2006,Academia Economic Papers

We find that there exists a non-linear relationship between the military spending and the long-run economic growth rate. We also find that there exists an optimal military spending share that maximizes the long-run economic growth rate. In addition, we prove that a rise in military spending has two channels to affect the level of welfare. The first channel is the national security effect. The second channel is the economic growth effect.

The empirical results show that the return-volume relations in these two exchanges are quite different. For Taiwan data, there are significant positive return-volume relations across quantiles, showing that a large positive return is usually accompanied by a large trading volume and a large negative return with a small trading volume, yet the effect of the former is stronger. However, such relations change when returns approach the price limits. We also find that for U.S. data, return-volume relations exhibit symmetric V-shaped across quantiles, showing that a large return (in either sign) is usually accompanied by a large trading volume. On the other hand, linear regressions estimated by the ordinary least square method are unable to reveal such patterns. Further investigation shows that various restrictions on short sales in the Taiwan Stock Exchange may explain the difference between the return-volume relations in the Taiwan and U.S. data.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200512-33-4-379-404-a,33.4,2005,Academia Economic Papers
The Effect of Collaborative Mechanism on the Structure of Research Strategic Alliance,"Hsueh-Jen Hsu, Ho-Mou Wu","Competitive research alliance, Cartel research alliance, Stable alliance structure, Optimal alliance structure","According to the intensity of cooperation, the literature differentiates two types of research alliances (RA), competitive RA and cartel RA. In both types of RA, partners share their research results. However, in cartel RA, each partner determines her research expenditure to maximize the sum of the member's profit, while in competitive RA, each partner determines her research expenditure to maximize her own profit. The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between the stable coalition structure and optimal coalition structure (which maximize the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus) under these two types of RA. From the previous results, we can tell the discrepancy between stable structure and optimal structure under each type of RA. And these results give us two policy suggestions. First, given the type of RA, the government can tailor the policy to influence the alliance structure, moving it from equilibrium structure toward optimal structure. Second, the government can also take actions to change the intensity of cooperation in order to realize the best type of RA.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200512-33-4-405-432-a,33.4,2005,Academia Economic Papers
The Effect of Supplemental Health Insurance under a System of National Health Insurance,"Yi-Chen Hong, Lin-Ti Tan, Chee-Ruey Hsieh","Supplemental health insurance, Service benefit policy, Indemnity insurance, Moral hazard","This paper analyzes the economic effect of supplemental health insurance under a system of national health insurance. Our analysis indicates that the purchase of supplemental health insurance can reinforce the risk-protection function of national health insurance. However, it may dilute the income redistribution effect and reduce the equity of health-care financing. Overall, the impact of supplemental health insurance depends on its reimbursement form. Indemnity insurance does not distort the relative price of medical services, and hence does not affect the financial burden of national health insurance. By contrast, a service benefit policy increases the medical expenditures because it decreases the relative price of medical service. An important policy implication of our analysis is that the mix of supplemental and national health insurance leads to a tradeoff between the function of risk-protection and the equity of health-care financing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200512-33-4-433-465-a,33.4,2005,Academia Economic Papers

It is shown that the elasticity of currency substitution plays a decisive role in the economic growth effects of monetary policy. Relatively higher money growth will result in a higher (lower) economic growth rate if the elasticity of currency substitution is larger (less) than one; while it raises the depreciation rate, regardless of whether currencies are substitutable or complementary.

In order to rationalize the use of a strategy of ambiguity, scholars have assumed either that voters are intrinsically risk loving, that candidates have their own policy preferences, that voters do not know where the candidates stand on policies, or that candidates do not know the distribution of voters' preferences. In this paper, we propose a reasonable alternative: that voters can secure a reservation utility from other alternatives when they feel alienated. Facing voters with such alternatives, candidates are likely to adopt ambiguous rather than clear strategies. In equilibrium, however, candidates do not want to be too ambiguous; it is advisable that they devote their campaign time to at most two policy stands.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200509-33-3-279-302-a,33.3,2005,Academia Economic Papers

The main purpose of the paper is in search of the possible mechanisms that may be at play in which a large trader may excise a disproportionate influence. We build a model of currency crises with endogenous beliefs where a single large trader and a continuum of small traders independently decide their trading positions. The trading position of the large trader is disclosed publicly to the market and interacts with small traders. The problem is analyzed on certainty and uncertainty grounds, respectively. In the certainty case, we find that when the long position of the large trader is large enough, a currency crisis will prevail, but intermediate levels of the long position will lead to multiple equilibria which are determined by sunspot variables. In the uncertainty case, the incidence of a currency crisis disproportionately increases as the long position of large trader rises. Therefore, the large trader increases the vulnerability of a country to speculative attacks in the foreign exchange market. Lastly, the paper closes with torture tests which show that the incidence of a currency crisis increases in the precision of public in formation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200509-33-3-351-378-a,33.3,2005,Academia Economic Papers
On Persumptive Tax,K. L. Glen Ueng,"Persumptive tax, Information rent, Elasticity of substitution","The traditional income tax system is not suitable for some industries in which audits by the tax authority are difficult when they evade tax. This paper proposes a tax scheme to estimate taxpayer's true income indirectly through the consumption in formation and to remedy the deficiency of the current income tax system. Suppose the economy includes observable and unobservable goods. Under the scheme, government can impose the tax on the consumption level of the observable good, but not on the income level of the taxpayers. The results show that: (1) the tax scheme is not only superior to the poll tax system, especially when the auditing cost is high enough, but is also superior to traditional random auditing mechanism. (2) Under this tax scheme, there is no distortion on the consumption behavior of the high income taxpayers, but it will twist the consumption behavior of the low income taxpayers. That is, the consumption of the observable goods is distorted downward, and that of the unobservable goods will be forward distorted. (3) The stronger the substitution between the observable and unobservable goods is, the weaker will be the incentive of high income taxpayers to comply with the tax scheme. However the impacts of the substitution on social welfare are ambiguous.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200506-33-2-141-171-a,33.2,2005,Academia Economic Papers

It shows that when Marshall-Lerner condition holds, the adjustment of real exchange rates has a unique saddle path. On the contrary, when the Marshall-Lerner condition does not hold, the adjustment of real exchange rates may be either unstable or indeterminate. Under the situation where the Marshall-Lerner condition fails, if the foreign monetary growth rate is zero, the dynamic system will be unstable. Moreover, if the foreign monetary growth rate is positive, and the currency substitution elasticity is equal to the cost elasticity of holding currency, then the dynamic system is unstable while the currency substitution elasticity is smaller than a certain constant value, and the adjustment of real exchange rates is indeterminate while the currency substitution elasticity is larger. Finally, if the currency substitution elasticity is unequal to the cost elasticity of holding currency, the relative magnitude between currency substitution elasticities and trade elasticities determines critically the dynamic properties of real exchange rates.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200506-33-2-173-200-a,33.2,2005,Academia Economic Papers
Allocation of Distribution Tax and Net Tax Burdens of Local Residents: Effects and Allocation Rates Assessment,"Steven Zong-Shin Liu, Kung-Cheng Lin","Distribution tax, Generational accounts, Net tax burden, Intergenerational fiscal burden","The allocation of distribution tax has persistently sparked heated and serious arguments in recent years. All previous studies focus on solving the short-run fiscal difficulties of local governments, and neglect the long-run effects of the allocation of distribution tax on fiscal burdens of local future generations. By extending the generational accounting approach (Auerbach, Gokhale, and Kotlikoff 1991, 1994), this study assess the effects of the allocation of distribution tax on intergenerational fiscal burdens in Taipei city, Kaohsiung city, and all counties (cities) of Taiwan as a whole. Base case analyses reveal that the intergenerational fiscal burdens are imbalanced in all districts and the inter-district gaps of intergenerational imbalances are large. This might spark more serious arguments in the future. Findings of simulations indicate that the allocation of distribution tax has remarkable effects on the intergenerational fiscal burdens. Based on the viewpoint of intergenerational fiscal burdens, for contracting the inter-district gaps of intergenerational imbalances and hence preventing future arguments, the allocation rate for all counties (cities) should be increased. It seems that to exploit revenues and reduce expenditures in all governments is the best way for preventing arguments on the allocation of distribution tax.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200506-33-2-201-239-a,33.2,2005,Academia Economic Papers

The FTPL argues that in a Ricardian policy regime, the price level is determined by the monetary variables. In a non-Ricardian policy regime, the government's solvency constraint provides an additional restriction that helps pin down the price level. This paper begins with the main propositions of the FTPL. These include the price level determinacy under an interest rate rule, the observational equivalence between the Ricardian and the non-Ricardian policy regime, the ineffectiveness of monetary policy on price control under specific fiscal rule, and the tight money paradox by which an aggressive interest rate rule can lead to explosive inflation. We then discuss the critiques of the theory, such as the fragility of the theory and the over-determination of price level.

This paper proposes a simple regression test for post-sample predictive ability that can reduce the problem. Our testing procedure can be easily implemented in major available canned software packages. Specifically, we test for zero intercept in an autoregression with suitably chosen lags accounting for autocorrelation in forecast errors. Our test is based on the notion that testing for predictive ability amounts to testing whether the function of forecast errors has a zero population mean. We establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed test. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that our test fares better than the existing ones in size performance, even in the presence of heterogeneous forecast errors, while maintaining comparable power.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200503-33-1-1-33-a,33.1,2005,Academia Economic Papers

Assuming uneven technology progress between the small-open economy and the rest of the world, its terms of trade would embed a stochastic trend and its natural rate of unemployment, affected by the terms of trade, thus has a unit root. The model is estimated by using the Kalman filter and tested with the maximum likelihood ratio test.

Wealth Effects on Consumption in Taiwan: An application of the Multivariate Markov Regime-Switching Model,"Ching-Fan Chung, Vei-Lin Chan, Kuang-Liang Chang","Excess sensitivity of consumption, Precautionary savings, Wealth effect","“The buffer stock theory” derived from the intertemporal utility maximization predicts that an increase in wealth will dampen the motive for precautionary savings and therefore reduce consumption’s over-sensitivity with respect to income changes. Since over the last forty years Taiwan has more than once experienced sharp rises in the values of the stock market and real estate, the goal of this paper is to examine whether the prediction of the buffer stock theory holds in Taiwan. The empirical model we propose is a trivariate two- state Markov regime-switching model originating from the Euler equation for consumption growth. The three macro variables we consider are the real non-durable goods consumption growth, the real GDP growth, and the real growth in the stock market’s total value. It is assumed that these three variables are subject to the same Markov regime-switching variable in determining their two states. Our empirical results using Taiwan‘s quarterly data suggest a high growth state and a low growth one: the former includes 1973Q3, 1973Q4, 1978Q3, .1987Q2-1990Q1, 1991Q2, and 1991Q3. The main finding of this paper is as follows: It is indeed the precautionary savings motive that causes the aggregate consumption in Taiwan to be overly sensitive to income changes, just as the buffer stock theory has predicted. When wealth in Taiwan, symbolized by the values of stock market, increased substantially under the high growth state, consumers’ precautionary savings motive weakened and the over-sensitivity phenomenon to a large extent disappeared.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200412-32-4-501-533-a,32.4,2004,Academia Economic Papers

It also discusses how vertical integration affects the upstream and downstream firms and social welfare.
We find the following results. First, the smaller the market size which the nonintegrated downstream firm faces and the more substitutable the two final products are, the less possible it is to encounter market foreclosure after vertical integration. Thus, the production of a non-integrated downstream firm will be larger and the price of final goods will be lower. Second, if market foreclosure for intermediate goods does not happen after vertical integration, the profit of a non-integrated upstream firm will decrease. Third, it is possible for the profit of a non-integrated downstream firm to in crease after vertical integration if the two final goods are (perfect) substitutes; it is possible for the profit of non-integrated downstream firms to decrease after vertical integration if the two final goods are complements.

"Banking Reforms, Productivity, and Risk Management in Taiwan's Banking industry",Ming-Hsiang Huang,"Uncertainty, Risk premium, Total factor productivity, Scale economies, Taiwan's banking industry","Over the last twenty years, the banking industry in Taiwan has experienced two major deregulation reforms aimed at increasing competition in the financial industry and improving productivity and efficiency. Departing from standard modeling on the productivity measure, this paper adopts a model that is based on the safety-first rule under uncertainty to measure the risk premium and productivity that are subject to loan default and other investment risks. Empirical evidence from panel data of forty-eight banks from 1981 to 2000 shows that Taiwan’s banking industry is characterized as risk-averse. The private banks are less cost-efficient in operations. The reforms did promote competition and increase productivity for the existing banks but not for the newly established private banks.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200409-32-3-413-439-a,32.3,2004,Academia Economic Papers

Based upon the input-output table, we create an industry-switching degree index (lSDl) which outperforms the traditional categorization methods to objectively characterize how each firm evolves in industry-switching behavior. Through Heckman's two-step estimation we find that, in Taiwan's electronics industry, the firm's TFP positively motivates the firm to switch but it tends to not affect its ISDI. The industry-level factor, the competition effect, and some firm-specific characteristics significantly determine a firm’s switching decision and its degree of industry-switching.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200409-32-3-441-465-a,32.3,2004,Academia Economic Papers
An Analysis of Productivity Growth in Western Australian Agriculture,Nazrul Islam,"Agriculture, Productivity growth, Research and development","This paper analyses the productivity growth of Western Australian broadacre agriculture for the period 1977/78 to 1999/00. The growth of aggregate outputs, inputs and total factor productivity (TFP) is estimated by applying a non-parametric approach and the productivity performance of WA agriculture is compared with that of other Australian states. The TFP growth in WA agriculture has been the second highest at 4.8 percent per annum. Within WA, among the broadly defined industry groups, the Crops industry has experienced the highest TFP growth of 7.1 percent per annum. The transfer and adoption of new technologies appear to have had a positive impact on the TFP growth of WA agriculture, besides the influence of seasonal conditions. Research and development (R&D) contributions of the Department of Agriculture Western Australia appear to have significantly influenced the State’s agricultural productivity growth.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200409-32-3-467-499-a,32.3,2004,Academia Economic Papers

The Optimal Insurance Contract with Tax Deductions,"Larry Y. Tzeng, Rachel J. Huang","Optimal insurance contract,  Taxi deductions,  Deductible,  Coinsurance","We examine the impact of tax deductions on optimal insurance contracts. We find that, under a proportional tax deduction system, a nonzero deductible is obtained even though there are no variable costs for the insurer. On the other hand, the optimal coinsurance rate would remain at unity, even under the tax deduction system, when the insurer is risk neutral. A policy with an upper limit cannot be the optimal contract, no matter what tax deductions are provided for losses. Furthermore, unlike Kaplow’s (1992) finding that tax deductions reduce an individual’s demand for coinsurance, our results show that the implementation of tax deductions increases the deductible but may or may not decrease the coinsurance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200406-32-2-313-334-a,32.2,2004,Academia Economic Papers

Endogenous Fluctuations of Real Exchange Rates under Different Exchange Rate Regimes,Shi-Kuan Chen,"Real exchange rates, Endogenous fluctuations, Periodic cycles",This paper purports to show that real exchange rate fluctuations may be generated endogenously through nonlinear business cycles in a simple overlapping generations economy which trades with the rest of the world under flexible or fixed exchange rates. The existence of periodic cycles or stationary sunspot equilibria near the steady state in this economy is established by applying the flip bifurcation theorem and may involve two important parameters: the subjective rate of discount; and the elasticity of intertemporal substitution. We find a close link between the non-explosiveness and stability of the system and the two parameters. We also compare the different conditions for the endogenous fluctuations of the real exchange rate between the two exchange rate regimes.,https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200403-32-1-83-105-a,32.1,2004,Academia Economic Papers
"Intraday Information, Trading Volume, and Return Volatility: Evidence from the Order Flows on the Taiwan Stock Exchange","Edward H.

We find that traders tend to concentrate their orders, but only the trading volume and volatility of the small stocks are positively associated with the concentration of orders. The liquidity orders do not influence volume and volatility as much as the information orders. The information carried by the large information orders tends to be private rather than public. But the trading volume at the open is not unusually high for our sample, notwithstanding very large order flows. We think that the TSE’s unique order-driven call market without specialists which imposes price limits and allows only limit orders makes traders very conservative at the open. In addition, the market-wide information affects the trading volume and volatility of the large firms through private information. The firm-specific information is not as clear a determinant of trading volume and volatility as the market-wide information. The diversity in the interpretation of information and speculative orders are positively related to trading volume and volatility.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200403-32-1-107-148-a,32.1,2004,Academia Economic Papers

"The Optimal IPO Strategy and IPO Discount: A New Perspective from Underpricing, Overreaction and Ownership Structure","Te-Chung Hu, Tai Ma","IPO discount, Underpricing, Overreaction, Ownership Structure, IPO timing, Cascade","Two principal contributions were obtained from this study. First, we tried to model the views suggested by Ma (1999), on the IPO discount being affected not only by undervaluing the offer price but also by overvaluing the market price. Second, we investigated the optimal issue strategy through combining the ownership structure with the IPO discount. There has been much previous literature about the IPO discount which discusses the offer price being undervalued. However, the market price can also be overvalued due to the market overreaction. In this study, we attempted to distinguish these two points from the traditional IPO discount. We expect to clarify more about both the IPO discount and the debate on it. In addition, although more and more studies discussed the combination of the IPO discount and the ownership structure, and attributed the IPO discount to the firm’s value or controlling interest, a complete analysis was not provided. Our model confirmed that the IPO timing should be the key issue considered by the issuing firm, which can reasonably explain the fluctuations in underpricing over time. It also showed that the relationship between the ownership structure and the prosperity of the market is not a linear function as what Bolton and Thadden (1998) have claimed. Moreover, a firm with low quality preferred to increase the amount of shares issued during IPO when the market is booming; the high quality one, on the contrary, did not do this. The entrepreneur tended to issue shares in IPO when the market is booming; however, for the newly potential enterprises, issuing shares was the best way to raise funds. Finally, the more the phenomena of subscription, the more the investors subscribe blindly and generate a cascade effect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200403-32-1-227-272-a,32.1,2004,Academia Economic Papers

Nevertheless, implications drawn from the dynamic dual models are subject to Lucas’ criticism due to the commonly maintained assumption of static price expectations. Explicitly incorporating the least-squares learning mechanism popularized by Marcet and Sargent (1989a), this paper establishes the duality between the firm’s production technology and the value function under nonstatic price expecations.

Previous research concerning the relationship between R&D and FDI only focused on the domain of expansionary FDI. In contrast, we try to analyze the relationship between defensive FDI and R&D. A three-stage game is considered in this paper. At the first stage, the home firm determines whether to undertake FDI or not. At the second stage, both home and foreign firms decide how much to invest in R&D. At the third stage, they decide how much to produce. It is found that FDI reduces firms’ R&D levels in the host country, while the impact of FDI on firms’ R&D levels in the source country depends on parameter values of the model.

The main findings are as follows. Firstly, the incentives for firms to FDI with market uncertainty will decrease in both monopoly and duopoly market structures. Secondly, in the case of duopoly, firms are more likely to undertake FDI when the competing firms undertake the export strategy rather than FDI. Thirdly, the possibility of increasing firms’ incentives to FDI is not clear when market structure has been changed from monopoly to duopoly.

An Applied General Equilibrium Analysis of WTO Tariff Reduction on Taiwan's Economy with Scale Economies and Imperfect Competition,"Kuo-Jung Lin, Shih-Hsun Hsu, Ping-Cheng Li","Tariff reduction, Computable General Equilibrium, CGE, Market structure","The objective of this paper is to examine the short-run and long-run effects of tariff reduction (unilateral trade liberalization) on Taiwan’s economy using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model which incorporates economies of scale and imperfect competition. The present model, built on the work of Abayasiri-Silva and Horridge (1998, 1999), describes a 9-sector CGE model of Taiwan’s economy, and covers short-run as well as long-run profit-maximizing behavior of the firm. Economies of scale are incorporated in the model at the industry level and the firm level. The pricing behavior is modeled as perfectly competitive, monopolistically competitive and in other ad hoc ways, as in Harris (1984). Simulation results show that tariff reduction caused import-competing industries such as agriculture to shrink. On the other hand, marketing and services industries and exporting industries such as IT industries expanded. The major conclusion is that the estimated gains from tariff reduction are larger in the industrial organization model (with economies of scale and imperfect competition) than those gains estimated from the competitive model.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200312-31-4-637-674-a,31.4,2003,Academia Economic Papers

Ultimate Control and Expropriation of Minority Shareholders: New Evidence from Taiwan,"Yin-Hua Yeh, Chen-en Ko, Yu- Hui Su","Corporate governance, Ownership structure, Ultimate control, Wealth expropriation, Taiwan","This paper provides further evidence to identify the ultimate controlling structure and the degree of expropriation of minority shareholders of listed companies in Taiwan. Compared with previous research, we focus on analyzing the control (voting) and cash flow rights owned by the controlling shareholder. We further distinguish two opposite effects of the controlling shareholders: the positive incentive effect and negative entrenchment effect. The findings of this paper indicate that Claessens et al. (2000) underestimate the control rights and cash flow rights of controlling shareholders and the proportion of family controlled companies in Taiwan due to insufficient disclosure of ultimate ownership structure. We adopt a simultaneous equation model to examine the relationship between the degree of expropriation of minority shareholder and corporate value. Based on our empirical results, we suggest that the deviation of control from cash-flow rights and the degree of collateralization of the stock held by controlling shareholders are two important variables in measuring the expropriation of minority shareholders. The two measurements also have a negative relationship on corporate value, supporting the negative entrenchment effect. In addition, the more cash flow rights owned by the controlling shareholder lead to higher corporate value, supporting the positive incentive effect. Finally, we suggest the regulations covering disclosure of ownership structure should adopt the concept of the ultimate control. That is, companies should provide the complete information for investors to trace and identify who owns the most votes in the companies and how many votes the controlling shareholder owns to distinguish the positive incentive effect and negative entrenchment effect of controlling shareholders.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200309-31-3-263-299-a,31.3,2003,Academia Economic Papers
When Will the Controlling Shareholder Expropriate Investors? Cash Flow Right and Investment Opportunity Perspectives,"Konan Chan, Shing-yang Hu, Yan-zhi Wang","Corporate governance, Investment opportunity","In this paper, we examine how investment opportunities influence the impact of cash flow rights on a firm value. Previous papers argue that cash flow rights serve as the incentives of a controlling shareholder to expropriate outside investors, and document that cash flow rights increase firm value. We find that when firms have opportunities to invest in positive NPV projects, cash flow rights do not increase firm value. However, when there exist investment opportunities and cash flow rights are relatively low, cash flow rights still increase firm value. Only when cash flow rights are relatively high, will firm value not be affected by cash flow rights, given the potential investment gains. Hence, in the presence of profitable projects, whether cash flow rights increase firm value depends on the level of cash flow rights. These results suggest a non-linear relationship between cash flow right of the controlling shareholder and firm valuation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200309-31-3-301-331-a,31.3,2003,Academia Economic Papers

On the Discrimination of Competing GARCH-type Models for Taiwan Stock Index Returns,Yi-Ting Chen,"GARCH, Asymmetric volatility, GARCH, Innovation distribution, Serial independence","In this paper, we concentrate on the discrimination between competing GARCH type models and innovation distribution assumptions for the Taiwan stock index returns. By using a two-step detection procedure, we find that the EGARCH with the ARCH-in-mean effect and the generalized error distributed innovations is the most promising one of a set of representative models. The in-sample comparison shows that the selected model generates different interpretations on the volatility from the GARCH model (with the normally distributed standardized innovations) when the market is volatile. The out-of-ample comparison demonstrates that the selected model outperforms the GARCH and RiskMetrics models for predicting the tails of the return distribution. This study also provides some empirical evidence with important implications on GARCH modeling. First, as shown by Chen and Kuan (2002) for the U.S. stock index returns, we find that the Ljung-Box, McLeod-Li, and BDS tests are unable to discover a misspecified GARCH model with the neglected asymmetric volatility effect for the Taiwan stock index return. Second, if the misspecification of the GARCH model is overlooked, then the neglected asymmetric volatility effect may be confused with the asymmetry of innovation distribution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200309-31-3-369-405-a,31.3,2003,Academia Economic Papers
Can Prospect Theory and Investor Protection Explain Banks' Incentives to Manage Earnings? New Evidence Across 48 Countries,"Chung-Hua Shen, Hsiang-Lin Chih ","Bank, Earnings management, Investor protection, Prospect theory, Behavioral finance, Corporate governance","Due to its highly regulated characteristics, the extent and motives of the earnings management on the banking industry may be distinct. The paper first examines the extent to manage earnings to exceed each of two thresholds: zero earnings and zero earnings changes. Then we test whether the prospect theory can explain these behavioral thresholds for earnings management. Third, if the extents to manage earnings differ across countries, can it be explained by the varied degree of the investor protection across these countries?
To test these hypotheses, we examine the properties of reported earnings of the banking industry for 47,206 firm-years between 1993 and 1999 across 48 countries. Our results demonstrate the significant evidence of the earnings management across countries, which appears to be strongly driven by the prospect theory. And we find that the earnings management decreases in outside investor rights, accounting disclosure, and the quality of inside trading. But it is striking that higher law enforcement contrarily results in more earnings management and thus possibly lower quality of financial reports of the banking industry.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200309-31-3-407-458-a,31.3,2003,Academia Economic Papers
Equilibrium Analysis of Enforcing After-Hours Fixed-Price Trading in a Call Market Under Asymmetric Information,"Chyi-Mei Chen, Chien-Shan Han ","After-hours fixed-price trading, Call market, Liquidity traders, Liquidity suppliers","This paper examines an order-driven trading mechanism similar to those adopted by Taiwan Stock Exchange and Paris Bourse, where no authorized market makers exist and public traders submit limit orders (price-quantity pairs) that are gathered and executed at one transaction price. We show that in the absence of market makers, in equilibrium rational liquidity suppliers are able to jointly construct a positively sloping supply curve by submitting tiny and different limit orders. Two types of equilibria may arise under this trading mechanism, the high-volume equilibrium and the low-volume equilibrium, where the former Pareto dominates the latter. We then analyze the effects of after-hours fixed-price trading on market liquidity and traders' welfare using the above framework. It is shown that the policy may benefit some liquidity traders if the liquidity demand is sufficiently high after closing. In the remaining case, the policy tends to raise the likelihood of the inefficient low-volume equilibrium before closing, and because of the price rigidity, it discourages trades from happening after closing. Summing up, the policy results in a reduction in both market liquidity and every trader's welfare.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200309-31-3-459-495-a,31.3,2003,Academia Economic Papers

The loan data from the end of 1992 to 1998 of 38 banks and 176 publicly-held companies in Taiwan were collected for empirical analysis. The major findings reveal that banks are able to reduce the information and monitoring costs by keeping strong relationships with their borrowers, and the lower costs are reflected in their loan pricing. Specifically, for paired and successive loan contracts, the loan rates of the subsequent periods are lower than those of the prior periods. We also find that the primary banks offer lower rates for their borrowers than non-primary banks. Further, a primary bank with long-term commitment would provide liquidity insurance to its borrowers. When borrowers' credit ratings are downgraded, they could obtain funds by increasing the credit lines more from their primary banks than from non-primary banks, although the effects might be influenced by the factors of government intervention, government-controlled banks and group-affiliated banks.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=1018161x-200309-31-3-497-539-a,31.3,2003,Academia Economic Papers

This indicates that subjects acted more aggressively in small groups, while in large groups they behaved rather passively.

【論文摘要】The Welfare Effects of Extending Unemployment Benefits: Evidence from Reemployment and Unemployment Transfers,"Tzu-Ting Yang, Po-Chun Huang",,"Unemployment insurance (UI) protects individuals from the risk of earnings loss during unemployment (i.e. insurance value), but it also distorts incentives to search for jobs (i.e. moral hazard). During a recession (e.g. the recent COVID-19 pandemic), extending UI benefits is one major policy tool that can be used to protect workers against adverse shocks. Although the duration of benefits as opposed to benefit levels is at the center of UI policy debates, most existing studies focus on the welfare effect of changing the UI benefit level. Empirical evidence regarding the value and welfare impacts of extending UI benefits (e.g. increase the potential duration of UI) is still scant. On the other hand, to reduce the moral hazard effect of UI, some countries have offered re-employment bonuses as financial incentives to workers who find jobs quickly. In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. government has considered implementing a re-employment bonus (i.e. a back-to-work bonus), to reduce the financial burden on the UI system and get people to rejoin the workforce. While the disincentive effect of UI, measured by the elasticity of non-employment duration to UI benefits, has been estimated across a wide variety of UI contexts, the incentive effects of re-employment bonuses are less studied and still largely rely on early U.S. bonus experiments. In this paper, we contribute to the current literature by examining the above under-studied issues. In the first part of the paper, we exploit two significant UI reforms in Taiwan, in order to investigate how workers' search efforts respond to income transfer when re-employed and unemployed. In 2003, the Taiwanese government introduced re-employment bonuses whereby people would be paid 50% of their remaining UI benefits after regaining employment. The re-employment bonus program reached back to UI recipients receiving benefits when the program took effect in 2003. Therefore, it resulted in two kinks in the offer for which workers were eligible as a function of the dates the UI spells started. Thus, we use a regression kink (RK) design herein to examine the effects of the re-employment bonus. On the other hand, after 2009, workers who lost their jobs when aged 45 or over became eligible for 9 months of UI benefits instead of the 6 months offered to those under 45. We use a regression discontinuity (RD) design to examine the effects of extended UI benefits, by comparing the outcomes of individuals just before and just after being 45 years old at the point of being laid off. Our estimates using the RK design show that the provision of a re-employment bonus increases the monthly re-employment hazard by about 2 percentage points and significantly reduces benefits duration and non-employment duration by 6% to 9%. Moreover, we find that faster re-employment does not significantly affect the quality of a job match, such as post-unemployment wage and job tenure. Second, our RD estimates suggest that a three-month increase in potential benefit duration reduces middle-aged UI recipients' monthly re-employment hazard by 3 percentage points. The implied elasticity of non-employment duration (UI benefit duration) with respect to potential benefit duration is 0.27 (0.78). However, being eligible for longer potential benefit duration has little impact on job match quality. In the second part of the paper, we integrate our reduced-form estimates with a search model to conduct welfare analysis. First, we investigate the behavioral costs of one NTD spending on the two policies. On the one hand, we find that the provision of re-employment bonus can induce the behavioral response (i.e. shortening spells of insured unemployment) that leads to a positive fiscal externality. The behavioral cost of one NTD of initial spending on the re-employment bonuses is -0.61 - the behavioral response to one NTD of re-employment bonus enhances the government budget by 0.61 NTD so that only 0.39 NTD have to be raised to finance one NTD of re-employment bonus. On the other hand, our estimates suggest that extending UI benefits result in a negative fiscal externality. The behavioral cost of one NTD of spending on increasing potential benefit duration is 0.07, which is at the lower end of previous research. Second, we exploit the two sources of income variation - re-employment bonuses and extended UI benefits - to estimate the value of UI extension. The value of UI is fully captured by the marginal rate of substitution between consumption when unemployed and employed (MRS), because the MRS describes how much consumption workers are willing to give up when employed, in order to increase one NTD of consumption when unemployed. Since workers' responses in re-employment hazard depend on their marginal utilities of consumption, the differential responses in the re-employment hazard to extended benefits and re-employment bonuses help us identify the MRS. An important issue we must address before estimating the MRS is that Taiwan's UI extension increases not only the potential benefit duration, but also the qualification period for re-employment bonuses - the UI extension increases workers' income not only when unemployed, but also when employed. To recover the effect of a pure unemployment transfer, we decompose the effect of the UI extension on the re-employment hazard into two effects: (1) the effect of an unemployment transfer and (2) the effect of a re-employment transfer. Our estimates suggest that the marginal value of an unemployment transfer during an extended benefit period is about two times larger than that of a re-employment transfer, i.e. an MRS around 1.5 to 2.5. Combining the estimated value of extended benefits with its behavioral cost, the marginal value of public fund (MVPF) of extending UI benefits is about 1.3 to 2; thus, a welfare gain of one NTD spending on extending potential benefit duration is about 1.3 to 2 NTD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-N202301060005-00001,50.4,2022,Taiwan Economic Review

We find that if the degree of privatization is high (low), the equilibrium is Cournot competition (public leadership or private leadership), irrespective of the foreign ownership ratio of the private firm. Nevertheless, if the degree of privatization is at an intermediate level, the equilibrium becomes sensitive to the degree of foreign ownership, changing from either public leadership or private leadership to private leadership, and finally to Cournot competition. Moreover, to our surprise, social welfare may increase with the foreign ownership. This result stands in stark contrast to previous literature, which asserts that foreign ownership always lowers social welfare.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-N202301060005-00002,50.4,2022,Taiwan Economic Review

We estimate the structural vector autoregressive model and counterfactual impulse response function. We consider three transmission variables, which include time on the market and transaction volume (as measures of housing liquidity) and housing price volatility (as a measure of price risk). We find that housing loans decline in response to monetary tightening, but this negative effect is less in cities where housing liquidity is more stable and price risk is lower. Counterfactual analysis indicates the main transmission variable is time on the market. Our findings also show the preference for bank housing loans when the intermediation cost increases. The smaller decline in housing loans in higher liquidity cities implies the time it takes real estate to be changed into cash is important to bank managers when granting real estate mortgage loans.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-N202301060005-00004,50.4,2022,Taiwan Economic Review

Results indicate that after the implementation of the Act, both emotional harmony and frequent parent-child chats, along with the evaluation of overall pro-sociality were increased. The adolescents were more likely to talk with their parents or siblings when they felt troubled. The increase in this parent-child interaction was mainly from the families where parents' education level was high school or below. Moreover, the implementation of the Act was negatively related to the likelihoods of engaging in playing sports activities, watching movies outside the home, and surfing the internet at home, and positively related to the likelihoods of engaging in outdoor activities (e.g., hiking or camping) and watching TV or video at home, and this increased demands for outdoor camping activity and indoor library recreation. This paper also discusses the possible reasons why the Act positively affects the likelihood of emotional harmony and frequent chats. The results show that the likelihood and quality of parents and children engaging in leisure activities together increased the frequency of parent-child interaction, leading to a better parent-child relationship.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-N202301060005-00006,50.4,2022,Taiwan Economic Review
The Effects of Extended Unemployment Benefits on the Reservation Wage: Evidence from a Benefit Extension in Taiwan,Po-Chun Huang,"extended unemployment benefits, reservation wage, difference-in-differences","This paper exploits an unemployment benefit extension for older workers in Taiwan to identify the effect of extended unemployment benefits on the reservation wage. Since 2009, the potential benefit duration for workers aged at least 45 at job loss has been 9 months rather than 6 months for those under 45. Using data from the Taiwanese Manpower Utilization Survey and a difference-in-differences design, I estimate that a three-month increase in potential duration of benefits increases the reservation wage for job losers by 4-5 percent. Moreover, the effect of extended benefits on the reservation wage is mainly driven by the reservation wage response during the extended benefit period and for workers who are most likely to exhaust their benefits. Combining the reduced-form estimates with a search model, my estimates suggest that it is welfare enhancing to increase the generosity of unemployment benefits for middle-aged workers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202209-202210130005-202210130005-251-301,50.3,2022,Taiwan Economic Review

Though Taiwan's sugar exports expanded greatly when ports were opened, this should be largely attributed to the ending of the Taiping Rebellion which reset Taiwan's trading pattern. Japan's opening of its ports did boost Taiwan's sugar trade, but Taiwan's sugar, which was produced in a backward manner, had difficulty competing with other Asian sugar produced by modern technology.

The addresses of all bank branches are geocoded to quantitatively analyze spatial competition in the choice of branch location. Controlling for observed socioeconomic variables, I estimate the effect on the number of a bank's branches in a township caused by nearby branches operated by own and rival banks.

Each player then compares the average payoffs received in the N rounds with her aspiration. If the former exceeds the latter, the player is satisfied and sticks to the same strategy for the next period; otherwise she randomly selects a new strategy from the set of feasible strategies that have not yet been adopted. If all strategies have been tried and none of them can fulfill the player's current aspiration, then the player lowers her aspiration. Players also have a small probability of making mistakes when adjusting their strategies or aspiration.

Using the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as a natural experiment, we identify an exogenous component of the cross-state variation in income tax changes and estimate the causal effects of tax burdens on interstate migration using instrumental variables and first differencing. We consistently find that an increase in state-specific income tax rates promotes migration outflows and discourages migration inflows of the families of prime-age householders in the United States, with the latter effect being typically stronger than the former. Despite the presence of significant marginal effects, income taxes and other fiscal policies account only for a small portion of the total variance in migration during the analyzed periods, 1985-1990 and 1975-1980.

Regime Shift in Environmental Policies-The Cause of Local Regulation Uprisings,Yusen Sung,"environmental federalism, policy regime shift, policy enforcement","Throughout US environmental regulation history, centralized regulation by the federal EPA has been the norm. More recently, however, state/local governments have taken a more active role by imposing more stringent environmental standards than the federal requirements. Some authors in the literature claim that this may be caused by the policy regime shift from the early command-and-control to incentive-based regulations. In this paper, we adopt both simultaneous-move and sequential-move regulation models, and consider both quantity and price policy regimes to see if and when this argument is valid. It is found that the policy regime shift theory holds only in a rather restricted sequential-move setting in which local EPAs lead the game.

Incorporating this element into a litigation model, private incentives in evidence collection are shown to be increasing in a judge's effort to process information. Diverting limited judicial resources to collect information, then, may generate multiple equilibria with different resource allocations. An equilibrium with more judicial resources devoted to information collection is accompanied with fewer resources for understanding, and thus lower private search effort. Unless the search capacity of the court is sufficiently high, public search will reduce the overall quality of judicial decision making. The model is also extended to consider whether a judge should disclose his ＂inner conviction＂ (心證), captured as the interim belief, before litigants present their evidence to the court.

Competition among Independent Power Producers under Long-Term Contracts: Evidence from a Transmission Tower's Collapse in Taiwan,Chia-Wen Chen,"collusive behavior, independent power producers, long-term power purchase agreement","To evaluate competition among firms, it is important to look at the substitution pattern between the firms. In 2013, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (Taiwan FTC) fined 9 independent power producers (IPPs) 6.3 billion NTD for their collusive behavior during their contract negotiation process with the utility company (Taiwan Power Company). The IPPs argued that they did not compete with each other in the electricity generation sector because they were already under long-term contracts with the utility company. In this paper, I use unit-level electricity generation data to examine the substitution pattern between IPPs. Using an exogenous event in which He-Ping Power Plant failed to provide power to the utility because its transmission tower had collapsed due to a typhoon, I examine changes in power supply by other IPPs.

In the first stage, two firms simultaneously and individually decide whether or not to precommit to their respective timing of market-entry at the beginning of the game. If a firm has decided not to precommit to its timing of market-entry, then it can flexibly alter its timing of market-entry in the second stage. After a firm's entry, it chooses its quantity supplied throughout each instance. The results show that both firms decide not to precommit to their timing of market-entry and sequentially enter the market in equilibrium when a firm's commitment cost is relatively high. When a firm's commitment cost is relatively low, only one firm decides to precommit to its timing of market-entry and behaves as a leader. The other firm decides not to precommit to its timing of market-entry and behaves as a follower.

Identifying Taiwan's Business Cycle Turning Points in Real Time,Hao-Pang Chu,"business cycle, turning points, machine learning","The official chronologies of business cycle turning points often suffer from a substantial time lag, which makes it difficult for economic agents to identify the starting point of a new business cycle phase. Following Giusto and Piger (2017), this paper identifies Taiwan's business cycle turning points after 2000s in real time using a machine learning algorithm known as Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ). Since LVQ does not rely on the specification of the business cycle's data generating process, it is suitable for addressing distinctive features in Taiwan's business cycles at different stages of economic development. Utilizing an LVQ algorithm, business cycle turning points can be identified quickly with a lag of between seven and ten months, considerably better than the official's 12 and 51 months. Furthermore, the empirical results suggest that the turning points identified by LVQ and the official method are quite consistent, and their differences are within a three-month range. In contrast, the turning points estimated by Markov-switching models are significantly different from the official turning points.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202109-202110080001-202110080001-335-370,49.3,2021,Taiwan Economic Review

We estimate a vector autoregressive model (VAR Model), which includes four VAR iables, i.e., industrial production index, real exchange rate, the real loan component of commercial banks, and M2. We employ a Blanchard and Quah (1989) structural VAR approach by imposing long-run restrictions on the coefficients of the moving average representation of the VAR to identify monetary policy shocks, money (asset) demand shocks, real aggregate demand shocks, and aggregate supply shocks. We find that in the short run both business and personal loans decline significantly in response to a monetary tightening. However, we also find bank loan portfolios tend to adjust after a monetary tightening, with a decrease in the proportion of less secured loans such as consumer loans and business loans for current operations while there is an increase in the proportion of more secured loans such as personal housing loans and business investment loans.

The effects of democracy on growth are positive and strong in countries with low growth rates, and weak in countries with high growth rates.

There are two main findings. First, in the partial information scenario with a revelation of a weak support base, subjects tend to have a higher belief in being pivotal than theory predicts, which causes their turnout rate to be not lower than those in the corresponding complete information scenario.

Furthermore the estimated model with working capital and habit formation simultaneously accounts for the co-movement between durables and non-durables and the more sensitive response in the durable goods sector to monetary policy shocks as documented in previous studies.

Inter-vivos Transfers in Taiwan: Evidence and Theory,"Daniel Barczyk, Tzu-Yu Lin","inter-vivos transfers, social norm, altruism","We study inter-vivos transfers between elderly parents and their children in Taiwan. We find that transfers from children to parents are almost 10 times more common in Taiwan than in the U.S. Our data suggests that this stark discrepancy is due to filial piety. The mere fact that children are employed is the most substantial predictor of transfers from children to parents. Similar to the U.S., however, wealthier parents are less likely to receive transfers and more likely to give. Based on these two key features we propose a first step towards a theory of the family in Taiwan. Children are obliged to transfer a fraction of their labor income to parents. Parents have altruistic preferences which can override this social norm. As a result, transfers from children to parents are common but do not occur in wealthier families.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202103-202104130005-202104130005-33-75,49.1,2021,Taiwan Economic Review

Estimating Taiwan's Forex Intervention Data,Hsiu-Yun Lee,"foreign reserves, exchange rate, foreign exchange market, intervention","We divide the change in Taiwan's foreign reserves into three parts: yield of the foreign reserves, intervention by the central bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the value re-estimation of the foreign assets (including those from the changes of exchange rates between the US dollar and other foreign currencies). It is found that, during the period 1982-2015, 56% of the accumulation of Taiwan's foreign reserves is from its yield while 44% of it is from official intervention. Employing the change in foreign reserves as a proxy for intervention tends to overstate the degree of intervention of Taiwan's central bank. Except for the period 1982-1987 in which official intervention to prevent an appreciation of the NT dollar is apparent with a unit root process, there is no evidence the central bank intervenes to twist the trend of its exchange rate.

【論文摘要】The Impact of Family Composition on Educational Achievement,"Stacey Chen, Yen-Chien Chen, Jin-Tan Liu",,"Gender bias in families has been persisting across generations in many regions. Girls in India, for example, get weaned earlier, receive less childcare and health care, and suffer from higher mortality. However, some studies find no evidence that Indian females receive less care than males under normal circumstances (Duflo 2005). Deaton (1997, 2003) suggests that Indian families have carried out equal parental spending and vaccination for both genders. Using data from Taiwan-a society with a long tradition of preferring sons over daughters - we also find surprising evidence of females having the advantage of completing high school or attaining a university education. One explanation for these mixed results is that women are more enduring than males given the same care (Waldron 1983); consequently, gender differences in child outcomes often understate the degree of gender bias. For purposes of detecting gender bias, one practical strategy for canceling out the endowment deficit of males is to estimate the sibling gender effect on child outcomes while keeping the realized number of siblings (sibsize) constant. The literature on sibling rivalry (or cross-sibling competition) has adopted that strategy. However, the method of ＂keeping the realized sibsize constant＂ does not work for households that would go on to have more children until they get a son-the so-called son-preferring stopping rule of childbearing (Yamaguchi 1989; Jensen 2005; Filmer, Friedman, and Schady 2009). Since the estimation method excludes households following the son-preferring stopping rule, previously estimated effects of sibling gender composition might have understated the degree of gender bias. Son preference and the son-preferring stopping rule suggest that having a brother may affect a boy's or a girl's human capital formation in two ways. One is an indirect effect (IE) by decreasing potential sibsize, and the other is a direct effect (DE) where potential sibsize remains constant. Under son preference, DE captures the rivalry effect of a son (relative to a daughter) on child outcomes, keeping other things (including potential sibsize) constant. Under the son-preferring stopping rule, IE captures the gain/penalty from the reduced sibsize by a brother's presence, keeping other things (including potential sibling gender) constant. If child quality is independent of quantity, then IE is zero. However, if child quality decreases with quantity, then IE is positive. Because DE and IE may go in opposite directions, a brother's overall impact on child outcomes can appear to be too small, particularly in countries with strong pro-son bias.5 Therefore, understanding the relative importance of DE and IE is necessary for detecting gender discrimination. Because the gender composition of the existing children affects the decision to have more children, ＂keeping the realized sibsize constant＂ has created bad-control problems. The problems understate DE and leave IE undefined since no variation in sibsize left for defining IE after holding constant the realized sibsize. The bad-control problem is more than an issue of endogenous sibsize. Even if sibsize were unrelated with unobserved determinants of child outcomes, the conventional method would still bias downward because of sibsize varying with sibling gender. Perhaps IE has been recognized and formulated in the literature, but IE's relative magnitude to DE is still an open question. Rather than keeping the realized sibsize constant, Barcellos, Carvalho, and Lleras-Muney (2014) propose a new method to address the bad-control problem. They shut down the IE channel by restricting their sample to infants under 15 months of age. This strategy works because mothers cannot respond to a child's gender by having more babies in such a short window. They find strong evidence of gender imbalance in receiving childcare, which is not masked by the son-preferring fertility-stopping rule. This study aims not to explain female advantage in education; instead, we seek to detect gender bias in family settings, although the aggregate statistics show patterns of female advantage in education. We provide causal estimates of the next brother's DE and IE on firstborn females/males' education. Our focus is the sibling gender effects on the firstborn (not on children born later); later-born children only exist if realized firstborn gender is such that parents continue fertility. The previous studies about family size effects have addressed the sample selection issue by estimating the impact of the later-born sibsize on the existing children. This selection issue is particularly relevant for Eastern Asian countries and several South-Eastern Asian fastgrowing economies, where fertility has fallen below the replacement level. As more than 50 percent of Taiwanese families in our data have only one or two children, we address this selection issue by focusing on firstborn outcomes. Our empirical work confronts four challenges. The first is to formulate DE and IE by overcoming the bad-control problem. Rather than using the realized sibsize to define DE and IE, we use potential sibsize because, in counterfactual worlds, it is possible to fix or change potential sibsize with a change in sibling gender composition. We decompose the overall impact of sibling gender on human capital accumulation into two separate causal channels: the active reallocation of parental resources along the direction of gender given potential sibsize (DE) and the passive effect of sibling gender through changing potential sibsize upon a change in sibling gender composition (IE). We show both theoretically and empirically that sibling gender's coefficient in a human capital formation model cannot be interpreted causally as the DE of sibling gender, even if consistently estimated. One can interpret the coefficient of sibling gender causally only in the absence of the son-preferring fertility-stopping behavior or the lack of an interaction term between sibling gender and family size in child outcomes. As expected, empirical results indicate a massive difference between the coefficient of sibling gender and the average DE, particularly for firstborn daughters, whose family size is more responsive to the next sibling gender compared with firstborn sons. The second challenge is to address the endogeneity of family size. While extensive empirical literature has taken the endogeneity of family size seriously on various outcomes (e.g., child education), this is less of a recognized issue in studies on the effect of sibling gender composition. Given that the sibling gender effect works in part through its impact on family size, it is crucial to treat endogenous family size properly. Only controlling for the realized sibsize in regressions of child outcomes on sibling gender yields misleading results. Following the previous literature on family size effects on child outcomes, we address the endogeneity issue by exploiting the plausibly exogenous variation in sibsize due to twinning at the second birth, conditional on family background characteristics. Critiques of the twins' instrument have noted that the tradeoff between child quality and quantity is understated (or overstated) if parents who have secondborn twins invest more (or less) in the first child than those who have a secondborn singleton, due to an endowment reinforcing (or compensating) motive. Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009) recommend a remedy for this problem by including the secondborn children's mean birth weight. Because fetal conditions may reflect the parental lifestyle, we prefer not to have a covariate relating to unobserved family factors. Nevertheless, we discuss the results from Rosenzweig and Zhang's approach as robustness checks. The third challenge is to address potential concerns about endogenous child gender due to possible sex-selective abortion or recall errors. We minimize this possibility by restricting the Birth Registry data to firstborn children born before 1985 when abortion was not legal, and sex-testing technology was not widely available. Using the same data like ours, Lin, Liu, and Qian (2014) have noted that the sex ratio at birth for the first two parities remained within the normal range between 1980 and 1992. The sex ratio started diverging from this after 1986 but only for the third- and higher-parity births. Consistent with their findings, our test statistics show that endogeneity of child gender for the first two births is not a concern in our data. The fourth challenge is to overcome data limitations. Typically, data analysts can only partially or indirectly observe the family size and sibling gender composition and cannot observe child outcomes directly after infancy. Using Birth Registry data for all of Taiwan since 1978, we ensure that each family's sibsize and sibling gender composition are complete and accurate by tracing at least 15 years of fertility history for each mother who first gave birth before 1985. By matching Birth Registry records with University Entrance Test records, we can observe each firstborn child's educational outcomes during adolescence, completed family size, and sibling gender composition. Using our modified approach, we find that both DE and IE are near zero for firstborn males. In contrast, firstborn females have a negative direct effect and a positive indirect effect, which almost cancels each other out, resulting in a near-zero total effect. This finding offers new evidence of gender bias in family settings, which cannot be detected by conventional methods. Conventional measures, such as gender gaps, have suggested clear female advantages of completing high school and entering university. Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates indicate much smaller DE and IE than those constructed from our instrumental variables (IV) estimates. This study represents the first attempt to formulate and evaluate the indirect effect of sibling gender on child outcomes via a change in potential family size. The result pointing to a large and positive indirect impact has important policy implications. Suppose parents' ability to control their total fertility is restricted (as in China's two-child policy). In that case, the overall rivalry impact of sibling gender could be much more significant. Although we study a particular economy where son preference is strong, it is precisely in countries where son preference is strongest to expect DE and IE's coexistence, driven by gender discrimination and son-preferring stopping rules. As a by-product of our analysis, we find the effects of family size on child education (and the direction of omitted variable bias) highly depend on sibling gender composition. OLS overstates family size effects if the next sibling is male and understates them if it is female. This contrast is particularly evident among firstborn girls. If the next sibling is also female, parents' utility gain from a larger family is more remarkable. If the next sibling is a brother rather than a sister, the son-preferring stopping rule kicks in, and parents' utility gain from a larger family decreases. The two-stage least squares estimates show that a third child in the family would lower firstborn daughters' high school completion rate or university admission rate by about one-third if the next sibling is female too. A next brother also reduces the effect of family size on firstborn males' education. However, the estimates are imprecise and much smaller in magnitude than the impact on firstborn daughters'. Our findings on family size effects are related to the quality-quantity tradeoff literature that uses sibling sex composition as an instrument for family size (Angrist and Evans 1998; Black, Devereux, and Salvanes 2005, 2010; Conley and Glauber 2006; Cáceres-Delpiano 2006; Angrist, Lavy, and Schlosser 2010). Most of these studies use data from countries where gender bias within the family is arguably small, and high demand for sons is rare. The direct effect of sibling gender on child outcomes is likely negligible (Huber 2015). The indirect impact via reduced family size is zero (assuming parents do not follow the son-preferring stopping rule). However, for data from countries with gender bias, our results imply that the firstborn's gender (or the gender composition of children in general) cannot be a valid instrument for fertility or family size because it affects child outcomes directly and violates exclusion restrictions. As with any study, this paper has some limitations. First, our empirical strategy is only valid when the secondborn's gender is random. However, the randomness of the secondborn's gender may not hold in other regions where sex-selective abortions are prevalent, as in India and China (Kishor and Gupta 2009; Wei and Zhang 2011). Second, using the twins' instrument, we find the proportion of compliers is 32-60 percent of the firstborn population. Given that 87 percent of our sample has two or three children, the percentage of compliers in some developing countries is likely lower due to larger family size. Nevertheless, the estimated magnitude of intrafamily gender bias is significant for policy. Unlike the previous evidence of gender bias, mostly focusing on infant females, our results show that intrafamily gender bias has a sizable negative impact on firstborn female adolescents' education. However, it is mostly indirectly offset by parents' fertility-stopping rules. China recently started to relax the one-child policy and bring in the two-child policy. We predict that a next brother (relative to a next sister) would harm the firstborn's human capital formation because the policy shutdowns the indirect channel would have offset the direct rivalry effect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202012-202101110004-202101110004-453-461,48.4,2020,Taiwan Economic Review

Two countries compete for FDI by providing public infrastructure, reducing taxes, or offering subsidies to foreign investors. We find that an increase in public infrastructure attracts more FDI if the government finances the public investment expenditures via labor income tax hikes, import tariffs, or government consumption reductions. Increasing public infrastructure also increases domestic production and results in an appreciation in the real exchange rate and a deterioration in terms of trade. However, the increase in public infrastructure results in a higher relative domestic labor cost, impeding foreign FDI and reducing the effect of the policies that attract FDI. Reducing the corporate tax rate is another effective way to draw FDI. However, corporate tax reductions do not work if the public infrastructure decreases along with the reduction of the corporate tax rate.

Product Licensing with Multiple Products,"Ray-Yun Chang, Hong Hwang, Cheng-Hau Peng","multiple products, vertically product differentiation, technology licensing, cournot competition","In practice, a low-quality licensee may continue to produce its low-quality product after receiving product licensing from a high-quality licensor. This paper assumes this is the case and constructs a vertically differentiated products model to investigate the optimal licensing contract and the resulting social welfare. We show that the licensee produces both the low-and high-quality products under royalty licensing; whereas only the high-quality product is produced under fixed-fee licensing. In addition, from the licensor's perspective, fixed-fee licensing is superior (inferior) to royalty licensing if the quality difference between the two products is small (large). Finally, the optimal two-part tariff licensing by the licensor should consist of a positive royalty and a positive fixed fee and the licensee necessarily produce both products after licensing. These results are in sharp contrast to those in the licensing literature with the licensee producing only the high-quality product after licensing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202012-202101110004-202101110004-547-572,48.4,2020,Taiwan Economic Review
A Learning Effectiveness Analysis of Game-Based Teaching in Economics,P. C. Roger Cheng,"game-based teaching, learning effect, difference-in-differences approach, item response theory","This article examines the effectiveness of game-based teaching on student achievement in a principles of microeconomics course. A total of twenty-two classes (nearly 1,500 students) participated in the study - fourteen of which (the treatment group consisting of 996 students) made use of two classroom games throughout the first half of the semester while the remaining eight classes (the control group consisting of 488 students) used the lecture-oriented approach. On the same range of topics covering markets, welfare, and public-sector policies, all classes jointly implemented one pretest and two post-tests. We find that students in the treatment group exhibited a more positive attitude toward economics, achieved a significantly greater short-term improvement in their understanding of advanced topics, but differed little in hours of study. Furthermore, the use of classroom games increased the mid-term retention of economic knowledge significantly and comprehensively, including a positive spillover effect on concepts not covered in the games.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202012-202101110004-202101110004-573-610,48.4,2020,Taiwan Economic Review
The Effect of Diploma and Major on Earnings - Evidence from the Taiwan Youth Project,Chia-Hua Liu,"Elite national college, Field of major, Earnings, Inequality in earnings","The paper examines the effects of diploma and major on earnings. The analysis is based on a longitudinal panel survey from the Taiwan Youth Project. The measures of earnings are the logarithm of hourly wage for the first job and the most recent job. The college types are categorized into private college, regular national college, and elite national college. The majors are simplified into those related to Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, or Medicine (STEMM) and others (non-STEMM). The highest degree is catagorized as lower than college, college (private college, regular national college, and elite national college), or master's (master for private college, regular national college, and elite national college). Without considering the major field, the results show that (1) with the same diploma, there is no difference in earnings between private college and regular national college, but those with an elite national college degree have higher earnings than those with private college degrees. (2) A master's earns more than a college degree within the same college type. If the major field is taken into consideration, most of the aforementioned results still hold. (3) Only the college type of highest degree has effects on earnings. (4) Assuming the same academic qualifications, there is no significant effect on earnings when transferring from first to the latest job. However, within the same college type, for those with a master's, the change in earnings when transferring from the first to the most recent job is higher than for college graduates.

The Hidden Fields in Late Ch'ing Taiwan,Tsong-Min Wu,"land rights, hidden fields","In September 1898, the Japanese Colonial Government in Taiwan began a cadastral survey. About ten years earlier, Liu Ming-ch'uan had proceeded with a land survey project to measure paddy and dry fields. The land area measured from the Japanese cadastral survey was 40% higher than that of Liu Ming-ch'uan. The discrepancy in the measurement from the two surveys is called ＂hidden fields＂ in this study. The hidden field ratio varied across the whole island. We find that the hidden field ratio is higher in the area where rice productivity is higher and law enforcement is better. The hidden fields can be divided into three types, and we find that the most popular type is the one with more secure land rights. After the cadastral survey was completed in 1905, a modern land right institution was established in Taiwan. Since then, land litigation cases decreased and land transactions increased.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202009-202010200002-202010200002-305-342,48.3,2020,Taiwan Economic Review

We then re-analyze the meanings of modern property laws and relationship between these laws and the capitalist economy from the legal and economic interaction perspective.

We find that: (1) local railway systems decreased trade costs and interregional price gaps between non-station areas and station areas, and non-station areas and non-station areas.

The Effects of Globalization on Labor Shares - Some Evidence from Taiwan's Manufacturing Industries,"Bih Jane Liu, Tzu-Han Yang, Deng-Shing Huang","labor share, globalization, technological progress, foreign direct investment","Taiwan has been experiencing fast globalization after the mid-1990s; Taiwan's labor share of income has also reached a peak in 1995 and has begun to fall since then. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether globalization is the main triggering factor for the falling labor shares in Taiwan's manufacturing industries. We show that manufacturing industries' adoption of more capital-intensive technology and increasing cumulative FDI to mainland China as a result of globalization are the two main factors causing the labor shares in Taiwan's manufacturing industries to fall. This is consistent with the findings in most previous literature. However, Taiwan's exports to China and cumulative FDI to countries other than China tend to raise labor shares, which is different from past findings. By breaking down the changes in labor shares, we find that because of the unique economic situation that Taiwan faces, the explanation for our empirical results (regardless of whether or not they are consistent with the literature) may differ from those provided by the literature.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202009-202010200002-202010200002-421-451,48.3,2020,Taiwan Economic Review
Student College Performance under the Multiple Entrance Policy - Evidence from Administrative Data of National Chengchi University,"Hao-Chung Li, Wen-Chieh Lee, Hsien-Ming Lien, Ping Wang, Kamhon Kan","multiple entrance policy, academic performance, nonacademic performance","This study uses the 2002-2015 administrative data of National Chengchi University to compare the performance of students entering through different tracks. Academically speaking, students admitted through high-school referral (REFER) performed the best, followed by those admitted through individual applications (APPLY). Students entering via joint examination and placement (JEP) on average performed least favorably. However, the academic difference between APPLY and JEP students were mainly due to their academic preparation before entering university. In particular, once we controlled for their score difference in the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT), academic performance in the university between APPLY and JEP students disappeared after 2007. On the other hand, REFER students still showed a strong academic advantage even after we controlled for GSAT scores. Also, we found that REFER and APPLY students were more willing to participate in school activities and join student clubs, though a substantial portion of this inclination can be explained by their GSAT scores. Finally, we devise an index to measure the scholastic match of each student to his/her department of study. The results suggest that since 2011, APPLY and JEP students on average have lower scores on this index, especially the ones from low PR high schools and low income areas.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202006-202007080010-202007080010-139-185,48.2,2020,Taiwan Economic Review

The result shows that academic performance of students from the Multi-stars program is best, whether using grades, ranking in department or z-score as measuring standards for academic performance. This result still holds when using only required courses. Next to students from the Multi-stars program are students from the Application channel, while students from the Joint College Entrance Exam (JCEE) channel are worst in academic performance. The academic performance of students from the Multi-stars program in math and science related departments is worse than their performance in non-math and science departments. Nonetheless their performance is still significantly better than students from the JCEE channel. Academic performance of students from the JCEE channel are worse than students from the Multi-stars channel or Application channel in academic hour inputs, learning satisfaction, and academic status stability. The superior performance of students from the Multi-stars channel over students from the JCEE channel can not be explained by more academic hour inputs. Grades from high-school might be a good reason for their superior academic performance in university. But this factor is not the sole reason for the superiority of the Multi-stars channel students.

Innovation Upgrades in Subcontractor Firms and Industrial Dynamics,Chung-Hsing Hsieh,"firm heterogeneity, innovation upgrades, variable demand elasticity, OBM","We introduce international fragmentation of production processes in the Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) model. We do so to explore perspectives on innovation upgrades in subcontractor firms. We first demonstrate that high-productivity firms are the firms that are most likely to develop into own-brand manufacturing (OBM) players. Such firms profit little from subcontracting upgrading and can afford the fixed cost of adoption. We then embed our results in a dynamic setting to address questions on the long-term evolution of latecomer firms and industrial dynamics. When adoption costs are high enough, a brand vendor can benefit from the OBM strategy of its partner, and consequently, does not boycott collaborative upgrades as retaliation. Furthermore, the impact of OBM strategies on market structure is demonstrated to depend on the extent of productivity heterogeneity. Market structure is unstable and low-productivity incumbents will be replaced by OBM players if productivity is heterogeneous enough. By contrast, old and new brands can coexist in a stable market. Finally, an exogenous decrease in the fixed cost of adoption can expedite subcontractor adoption of the OBM strategy. This may persuade a higher fraction of OBM players to join.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-202006-202007080010-202007080010-269-299,48.2,2020,Taiwan Economic Review

We build a general equilibrium life-cycle model with endogenous labor supply on both intensive and extensive margins, consumption, savings, and benefit claiming. We conduct counterfactual analysis to evaluate the impacts of various reforms that could balance the pension budget while taking current demographic changes into account. We find that the pension system can be self-financed if the government (i) increases income taxes by 5.4%, (ii) increases consumption taxes by 6.2%, (iii) increases pension taxes by 9.3%, or (iv) decreases the pension benefits by 23.5%.

Top ranked students in high school are considered by the Star Program. Students interested in the Application Program are first screened by their GSAT (General Scholastic Ability Test) scores, and those who pass this screening will be further evaluated by the departments. Students not admitted by these two programs take a national joint entrance examination (Exam) and will be matched with departments of various universities based on their scores. This study compares college performance of students who enter NTU via different channels. We find that students admitted by the Application Program perform better than those admitted by the Exam Program. However, this performance difference could be explained by the difference in their GSAT scores. Star students, on average, perform better than other students. Once we focus on high schools that have no graduates entering NTU via the Application or Exam Program, we find their Star students have lower college scores than other students.

Median Location and Economic Geography,Jyh-Fa Tsai,"median location, core-periphery model, New Economic Geography, agglomeration, three regions","This study explores the role of median location in a footloose entrepreneur (FE) version and Helpman's (1998) version of NEG models. Two kinds of location distribution for three regions are considered: One is an equilateral triangle (with no median location). The other is the distribution in which three points are equidistant between two adjacent points on a line (the middle region is the median region). The results show that there are some differences between these two settings. In the setting with no median location, firms will agglomerate at any of the three regions with low transport costs in the FE model and high transport costs in the Helpman model and will equally distribute among the three regions with high transport costs in the FE model and low transport costs in the Helpman model. In the setting with a median location, the symmetric industrial dispersion among the three regions emerges when transport costs are larger than those in the triangle with no median location in the FE model, because the advantage of median location is lost only when transport costs are larger. However, this symmetric dispersion never emerges in the Helpman model unless transport costs approach zero. In the Helpman model, a unique asymmetric distribution at the median location increases from one-third as transport costs increases. This shows that the advantage of median location exists even in the Help-man model, which provides housing services as a major centrifugal force.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201912-202001070003-202001070003-543-578,47.4,2019,Taiwan Economic Review

The Impact of a Raise in Reimbursement: A Payment Increase for Vaginal Delivery in 2005 as an Example,"Hsien-Ming Lien, Hsing-Wen Han","cesarean section, induced demand, healthcare quality","In May 2005, Bureau of National Health Insurance doubled the reimbursement for vaginal delivery to the same rate as paid for cesarean section (c-section) in order to reduce the c-section rate and improve the quality of care. This reimbursement adjustment provides an excellent opportunity to examine whether such a payment increase can improve healthcare quality. Using obstetric cases of firstborns in 2004 and 2006 from National Health Insurance Data, this study examines if there was a negative relation between quality indicators (e.g. c-section, re-admission, and length of stay) and doctor's income, measured in terms of payments paid by NHI for baby delivery. To control for the endogenous bias, the study employs ＂first-difference＂ methods to attenuate the bias arising from unobserved factors, and restricts the sample to firstborn babies. Our results indicate that the doctor's income and c-section rate is statistically uncorrelated on the whole, but negatively related for doctors who previously had a lower percentage of c-sections. Additionally, we found the payment reduces both the 14 and 30 days re-admission after vaginal delivery. Furthermore, the analysis indicates that one explanation- a c-section is preferred by women for the sake of personal reasons- is largely consistent with our empirical findings. Finally, we found the effect of the payment increase did not spill over to gynecology or pediatric services in the same hospital.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201912-202001070003-202001070003-621-664,47.4,2019,Taiwan Economic Review
Public Information and Information Aggregation in Committees,Cheng-Tai Wu,"strategic voting, public information, Condorcet jury theorem, Condorcet jury theorem","We investigate how public information affects the voting behavior of the voters and the error (information efficiency) of the equilibrium decision of a committee. The influence of public information on efficiency can be decomposed into the information effect and the equilibrium effect. Public information provides an extra piece of information that helps the voters better match their votes with the received signals, and hence may reduce the error. However, it also affects the equilibrium behavior of the strategic voters, and this may increase the error. We show that for any non-unanimous voting rule, when the precision of public information is marginally higher than that of private information, the information effect is negligible, while the equilibrium effect has negative impact on efficiency. Hence, public information with low precision may make the decision of the committee worse. By contrast, for the unanimous rule, the equilibrium effect has positive impact and public information will always improve the efficiency. Furthermore, we find that the existence of non-strategic voters may cause asymptotic inefficiency when the voting rule is too stringent in the sense that it is far away from the simple majority rule. Public information can de facto alter the voting rule to be less stringent through its influence on the votes of the non-strategic voters. Thus, the efficiency can be improved.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201909-201910180004-201910180004-321-361,47.3,2019,Taiwan Economic Review

Education does not reduce this belief. Unless individual's educational attainment is higher than or equal to a college degree, education actually encourages the belief. Using happiness, health status, marital status, educational attainment, and income to represent fate, one's fate is not associated with the number of strokes in one's Chinese name. The former three types of fate are not correlated with the number of Chinese name strokes. Educational attainment is positively associated with the degree of luck in the number of Chinese name strokes. This relation disappears, however when the manipulation of Chinese name strokes and parents' investment in children are controlled, indicating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

International Currency and Monetary Policy in a Model with Heterogeneous Productivity,"Ying-Syuan Li, Yiting Li","international currency, heterogeneity in productivity, two-country two-currency search monetary model, monetary policy","We construct a two-country two-currency search monetary model to study how improved productivity in a country affects the circulation of its currency, and the monetary policy implications. Increased productivity in a country helps its currency circulate internationally, and this is more likely to occur if its market size is large and inflation rate is low. If the issuer of the international currency (e.g., the U.S.) has higher productivity, it enjoys higher welfare than the other country. In the local currency issuing country, the welfare of its producers is lower than that of consumers, due to the productivity disadvantage. Higher inflation of the international currency results in different impacts between countries, and across different types of agents in the other country: First, it reduces welfare in both countries, with the international currency issuing country suffering higher welfare loss; second, it hurts consumers more than producers in the other country, and thereby reduces the welfare differential, because consumers need to pay more seignior-age taxes. If the local currency issuing country has higher productivity, it enjoys higher welfare than the international currency issuer.

On the Intergenerational Transmission of Parental Education and Learning Achievement to their Children: A Study based on Taiwan Data,"Mei Hsu, Been-Lon Chen","quantile regression model, intergenerational transmission in education, differential in educational attainment, TEPS","Utilizing more efficient estimators from quantile regression models and the reactions in quantile of the whole distribution, we analyze the systematic differences in intergenerational education correlations across the conditional quantiles of pupils' test scores. The key question is whether the bottom of the test score distribution looks different than the top. Our empirical evidence indicates a strong intergenerational transmission of educational inequalities between parental education levels and junior and senior school pupils' learning achievements. Parents with higher education affects pupil's learning in significantly positive ways. The differentials in senior and junior high school pupils' score distribution are positively associated to their father's education. Although these differentials persist in the high tail of these pupils' score distribution, there is convergence in the high tail of junior high school pupils' score distribution. The mother's education has a significantly higher influence on the learning distribution of junior high school pupils' score. By contrast, a father's education has a stronger impact on the learning distribution of senior high counterparts. Given a father, with the same education, a mother significantly and positively affects both junior and senior high school pupils' mathematics scores in the high end of the distribution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201906-201907030007-201907030007-217-272,47.2,2019,Taiwan Economic Review
Imposing Monotonicity and Curvature Conditions on the Bayesian Stochastic Directional Distance Function to Measure Efficiencies,"Tai-Hsin Huang, Chia-Wei Lin, Chu-Nan Hu","Bayesian approach, directional distance function, undesirables, monotonicity and curvature","This paper applies the Bayesian approach to estimate the directional distance function (DDF) with the imposition of monotonicity and curvature, using national data covering 1970-2010. The inefficiency term is further specified as a function of several environmental variables. The salient feature of DDF is its ability to take undesirables into account. For the purpose of comparison we also estimate the output distance function. Evidence is found that the output distance function tends to overestimate the measure of technical efficiency and underestimate the rate of technical change. DDF that imposes monotonicity and curvature is found to be superior to the output distance function in terms of estimated efficiency scores and the rate of technical progress.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201906-201907030007-201907030007-273-320,47.2,2019,Taiwan Economic Review

In this paper, we adopt, in a panel data context, a nonlinear multiple-regime model, namely Threshold Autoregression (TAR), and perform a panel unit root test for each regime in the TAR. This new procedure takes advantage of two existing approaches: the inference for a TAR model with a unit root, and the panel unit root tests with the augmented panel Dickey-Fuller regression. The real exchange rate dynamics in a panel of 17 OECD countries over the recent floating exchange rate period are investigated. Three distinct regimes are identified. In particular, the support for long-run PPP is much stronger in the post-Maastricht-Treaty period than the period before; in the pre- Maastricht-Treaty period, there is some evidence for long-run PPP when the sterling-dollar appreciated, while the evidence is weak when the sterling-dollar depreciated.

Does Legal Punishment of Drunk Driving Deter Alcohol-Involved Traffic Accidents? An Application of the Regression Discontinuity Approach,Wei-Der Tsai,"regression discontinuity design, Article 185-3 of Criminal Code, Section 35 of Statute Governing Road Traffic, Article 114 of Rules of Road Traffic Safety","This study examines the effects of the statutory changes in drunk driving penalties on the incidence of alcohol-involved traffic accidents. During 2003-2013, several regulatory changes regarding the punishment for drunk driving were implemented, aiming to deter driving after drinking via raising the fine, extending the license suspension period and adding jail time, etc. Employing the regression discontinuity design, we empirically investigate whether the four statutory changes have effects on the deterrence of alcohol-related traffic accidents, leading to a lower ratio of drunk-driving traffic accidents to total road accidents. Our empirical results indicate that only the last statutory change of Article 185-3 of the Criminal Code, significantly reduced the ratio of drunk driving accidents. That statutory change also had spillover effects, lessening both the number of alcohol-related traffic accidents and the total number of road accidents. Two changes contributed to the drunk-driving reducing effects. One is the insertion of the BrAC/BAC legal level in the statute of the Criminal Code. The other is the lowering of the BrAC/BAC criteria for administrative penalties for drunk driving. Our empirical results provide implications for policy aiming to ban drunk driving.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201903-201904110005-201904110005-75-126,47.1,2019,Taiwan Economic Review

However, the death of ＂Liu Xiaodi＂ after vaccination triggered a pan-green media questioning of the safety of the vaccine. In response, Minister of Health, Dr. Yang, criticized irresponsible media reports that would endanger Taiwanese heath. Because vaccines for preschool children require two doses, with a four-week gap, to ensure sufficient protection, we thus employed the National Health Insurance dataset to obtain vaccination records for children aged between 1 and 6, and used the second dose vaccination rate (after the Liu Xiaodi incident) to investigate the impact of the media effect. Given that the pan-green media has a higher rating in agriculture counties, we also employ the DD method to compare the second dose rate of children covered by public employee insurance and farmer insurance. Our estimates indicate a large reduction in the second dose vaccination rate, ranging from 12% to 22%. Results of DD estimation also confirms the presence of spillover effects. Finally, the reduction of the vaccination rate significantly decreases, not increases, the hospital admission rate due to H1N1.

An Estate Tax Data Analysis of Wealth Inequality and Wealth Composition in Taiwan,"Da-Kai Wu, Joe Chen","wealth inequality, wealth composition, estate tax","Based on estate tax returns from 2001 to 2015 and using the estate multiplier method to blow up the sample of decedents to represent the number of the living, this paper analyzes wealth inequality and wealth composition in Taiwan. The results suggest that the degree of wealth inequality has gradually increased in recent years, in accordance with the observation that financial assets became more concentrated. In addition, the concentration of wealth and the resulting inequality is not only between the rich and the poor; it also happens within the rich group. At the same time, the results suggest a tendency to hold more financial assets as opposed to real estate and other non-financial assets. One of the possible explanations is that the decreasing effective tax rate of the estate tax reduces incentives to hold real estates for tax benefits. Despite the increase in the proportion of financial assets, land is still the major choice of property holding as measured by the ratio of wealth. The second part of the study uses regression analyses to explore the relationship between the effective tax rate (of the estate tax) and the composition of wealth. Results show that the effective estate tax rate is positively correlated with the ratio of land to total wealth, and negatively correlated with the ratio of deposits and investment. These results show that when facing a higher tax burden, individuals tend to take advantage of the undervaluing of land in the current tax system to obtain tax benefits. This adds to existing evidence that taxes distorts individuals' choice of asset types, and affects individuals' decisions on asset allocation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201812-201901070007-201901070007-523-567,46.4,2018,Taiwan Economic Review

Although students' satisfaction with school is increased, their academic pressure is not alleviated after the program. Students entering schools via different channels differ in satisfaction with school and performance in school.

The empirical result shows that the sensitivity of trade to the exchange rate varies substantially for different commodities. Overall, China's exports are less sensitive to the exchange rate than imports. Counterintuitively, we find that RMB appreciation reduces China's intermediate goods imports. A possible reason is that the appreciation harms its final goods exports in the assembly sector, thus indirectly lowering the demand for the required intermediate goods imports. This finding, along with the finding that final goods exports, the major source of the trade surplus, are not sensitive to exchange rate changes, are probably the main reasons why RMB appreciation has a limited effect on restraining China's rising surplus.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201809-201810120002-201810120002-333-362,46.3,2018,Taiwan Economic Review

Assuming sample selection, we apply copula methods to derive the joint probability density function for composed errors in the equations of wage and hours of work. The likelihood function can take both workers, who have observed wages, and non-workers, who have no observed wages, into account. Non-workers are usually excluded by previous researchers, studying similar issues, since they overlook the role of sample selection. The empirical results show that the trend of wage efficiency in the categories of working identity and working area are almost the same in each gender, whether correcting for the sample selection problem or not. However, in the remaining 4 categories, the sample selection bias appears to play an important role on the determination of wage efficiency.

Based upon a unique dataset which provides the complete histories of transactions, housing characteristics and investor attributes in the real estate market, we investigate whether the market participants are likely to fall into the anchoring trap. The quantile regression allows us to show the difference between high-priced and low-priced dwelling units on investor's cognitive biases. We find that anchoring is a common phenomenon, regardless of gender; however, sophisticated homebuyers are less susceptible to the anchoring bias. Male homebuyers faced with higher-priced real estate exhibit higher levels of anchoring, and homebuyers faced with higher systemic uncertainty exhibit higher levels of anchoring also when faced with high-priced real estate.

We find that the high-quality firm will never license its technology to all the low-quality firms if there are more than two low-quality firms, which is a result that has never been documented in the literature. We also show that fixed-fee licensing is more profitable for the licensor, if the technology gap is small, which is a result opposite to that in the cost-reducing licensing literature. We further show that under certain circumstances, fixed-fee licensing is less socially desirable than royalty licensing. Finally, if the licensor firm adopts a two-part tariff contract, then the optimal contract may consist of a pure royalty, a positive royalty and a positive fixed fee, or a pure fixed fee, varying with the technology gap between the two types of firms. These results hold even if the licensees are subject to capacity constraints and cannot raise their quality to the leucl of then of the licensor via licensing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201806-201808030002-201808030002-181-224,46.2,2018,Taiwan Economic Review

The statistical results show that the CBC adopts the 'leaning-against-the-wind' policy and intervenes in the foreign exchange rate market more often when the New Taiwanese dollar (NTD) appreciates than when the NTD depreciates. Nevertheless, the empirical result shows that the against-NTD-depreciation interventions leads to significant changes in the exchange rate, but not the against-NTD-appreciation interventions. Moreover, the effect on the exchange rate change of the against-NTD-depreciation interventions is larger than the against-NTD-appreciation interventions, which implies that the CBC's intervention policy has asymmetric effects on the exchange rate change.

We use structural decomposition analysis to find the relative contribution of five factors causing the changes in the energy and carbon embodied in exports. From 1996 to 2001, the changes in the direct energy efficiency, the structure of intermediate inputs and the structure of exports were the most important factors contributing to the changes of energy and carbon embodied in Taiwan's exports. Between 2001 and 2006, the structure of exports has been the most important factor causing the changes. This paper also explores whether energy policy could have effectively reduced the energy and carbon embodied in Taiwan’s exports. Our results show imposing a carbon tax on using fossil fuels would have decreased the carbon embodied in exports only moderately from 1996 to 2001.

The Stars Project also effectively increases the total number of senior high schools from which NTU students graduated. Although we find that ＂admission via application＂ has a higher proportion of students who graduated from elite high schools, and has higher average township income, due to the time sequence of ＂admission via application＂ and ＂admission via the joint college assigned-subject examination,＂ we still can not conclude that ＂admission via application＂ is more advantageous for students with better socioeconomic family backgrounds. In addition, the increasing proportion of ＂admission via application＂ in the multi-channel admission program, along with the fact that a smaller proportion of female student are admitted via application, may have contributed to the overall slight decrease in the proportion of females admitted to NTU.

In addition, maximizing the economic growth rate is equivalent to maximizing social welfare.

Empirical results show that smaller absolute BTD are associated with higher auditor industry expertise. Moreover, using two stage estimation methods to investigate the indirect effect of auditor industry expertise on BTD through earnings quality, we find that discretionary accruals is smaller for clients of auditor industry specialists than for clients of auditor industry non-specialists and that lower discretionary accruals in turn reduces the magnitude of BTD.

Deciding the Short-Run Interest Rate and Information Transparency: The Application of a Bank Run Model,Chi-Ting Chin,"global game, bank runs, information transparency","Goldstein and Pauzner (2005) emphasize that a decrease in the short-run interest rate can cut down the probability of a bank run, so that the optimal interest rate is lower than the first-best interest rate. Suppose that banks never close down, Selvaretnam (2006) finds that information transparency reduces the probability of a bank run, and thus exposing as much information as possible can maximize the expected utility of depositors. This paper expands the models of Goldstein and Pauzner (2005) and Selvaretnam (2006) to situations in which the government chooses the short-run interest rate and information transparency at the same time. We simulate the optimal short-run interest rate and the optimal information transparency, and find that they are related with the risk-averse degree of depositors and a function of the long-run return. In a variety of situations that we simulate, the optimal interest rate is not necessarily lower than the first-best interest rate and exposing information does not maximize the expected utility of depositors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201712-201801290001-201801290001-547-577,45.4,2017,Taiwan Economic Review
Son Preference and Birth-Order Effects: Re-Investigating Household Resource Allocations in Education among Children in Taiwan's Families,Huei-Chung Lu,"birth order, son preference, ordered logit with fixed effect","This research utilizes PSFD (Panel Survey of Family Dynamics) and conducts an empirical study on the ＂son preference＂ and ＂birth order＂ effects by using the ordered logit model with fixed effects proposed by Ejrnæs and Pörtner (2004). We find that, first of all, there is a significant son preference effect found when parents make their education investment on children. However, the sex inequality of the education investment of mainlander families is not the smallest among all ethnic families as claimed by the existing literature. Secondly, children with later birth orders are found to have higher educational achievements. Furthermore, the difference in educational achievement among sons is less than that among daughters; and thus the difference between sons and daughters is decreased when they are in later birth orders. We also find that birth spacing will also have an asymmetric effect on a child's educational achievement. A child who was born at a distant time to the adjacent older sibling tends to have a higher educational achievement; while his/her achievement shows a negative relation with the spacing to the next younger sibling. Finally, being one of twins may have an adverse effect on his/her educational achievement.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201712-201801290001-201801290001-579-637,45.4,2017,Taiwan Economic Review
Insider Licensor's Licensing Strategies under Asymmetric Information,"Kuang-Cheng Andy Wang, Yi-Can Wu, Wen-Jung Liang","pooling licensing strategy, separating licensing strategy, royalty licensing, fixed-fee licensing, two-part tariff licensing","We examine the insider licensor's optimal licensing strategy and contract under asymmetric information, in which only the licensee owns the cost information post licensing while the licensor has no such information. We obtain the following results. Firstly, the insider licensor may choose to license to only one type of licensee and use the pooling licensing strategy, regardless of the relative marginal cost of the licensee post licensing to that of the licensor. However, the separating licensing strategy can only be used when the marginal cost of the licensee, post licensing, is smaller than that of the licensor. Secondly, when the licensor chooses the pooling licensing strategy, it must adopt a royalty licensing contract and the royalty rate will be greater than the amount of the reduction in the less efficient licensee's marginal cost. Lastly, provided that the licensee's marginal cost post licensing is smaller than that of the licensor and that the licensor chooses to license to only one type of licensee or use the separating licensing strategy, the optimal licensing contract can be royalty, two-part tariff or fixed-fee licensing. The diversity of the optimal licensing contract derived in this paper is consistent with observations in the real world, and is sharply different from the conventional result in which royalty licensing is always superior to fixed-fee licensing for an insider licensor.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201712-201801290001-201801290001-639-674,45.4,2017,Taiwan Economic Review

The Communication Effect of the Central Bank of Taiwan on Interest Rates and Exchange Rates,"Chi-Hung Kang, Hung-Jen Wang, Nan-Kuang Chen","central bank, transparency, communication policy","This paper studies the communication policy of the central bank of Taiwan. We analyze the issue by categorizing the central bank's communication efforts into ＂news releases after the Board of Governors' meetings＂ and ＂talks of central bank's officials in the media.＂ We further decompose the communications into three sub-categories: monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and economic perspectives, to estimate their respective effects on interest rates and exchange rates. IF communication policy is effective in terms of revealing new information to the market, then we would expect to observe significant changes in interest rates or exchange rates on the day the news is released or one day after, and the changes should be consistent with what policy makers had intended. Data show that the central bank of Taiwan seldom clearly indicates the potential movement of exchange rates in news releases after the Board of Governors' meetings. Nevertheless, media reports suggest that officials frequently communicate with the market on exchange rate related issues. We also find that communications about exchange rates do not significantly affect the movement of the exchange rates, while most communications concerning monetary policy significantly affect various market interest rates.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201709-201710020003-201710020003-421-452,45.3,2017,Taiwan Economic Review
How Does the Change in the System of Legislative Elections Affect Incumbency Advantage in Taiwan?,Chien-Yuan Sher,"incumbency advantage, first-past-the-post voting, single non-transferable voting, nested logit model","Incumbency advantage is the benefit of being an incumbent in an election. In 2008, the legislative electoral system in Taiwan was switched from single non-transferable voting to first-past-the-post voting. The number of seats was also halved from 225 to 113. After this change, incumbents were able to deter quality challengers from running, and they could also deploy more resources in constituency services than their predecessors. Therefore, incumbents in the 2012 legislative election should have more advantage than those in the 2004 election. The author used a survey data set from Taiwan's Election and Democratization Study. The empirical results indicated that being an incumbent could offer statistically significantly advantage in the 2012 election, but incumbency advantage was not statistically significant in the 2004 election.

The Enrollment Game: Conflicting Entrance Examinations of Graduate Schools in Taiwan,"Yi-Cheng Kao, Chien-Hui Lin","entrance mechanism of graduate schools, competition in time, top universities","Concerning the entrance mechanism of graduate schools in Taiwan, the conflict of examination dates has been a crucial issue over the years. In particular, top, middle, and lower universities cluster their examinations during February, March, and April, respectively. In this paper, we developed a model to explain this phenomenon of diverging dates. The model shows that when the examination exhibits measurement error, i.e., the best (worst) student may not have the highest (lowest) testing scores, the phenomenon is an equilibrium among universities competing for better students. Specifically, when the measurement error increases, a top university will have an earlier examination to decrease the error and raise the probability of enrolling best students.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201709-201710020003-201710020003-495-513,45.3,2017,Taiwan Economic Review

The empirical results indicate that PPP holds for five of the six high-growth countries studied, namely Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico and South Korea, using the KSS test. Furthermore, using Sollis (2009) AESTAR unit root test reveals that real appreciations in the value of the Indonesia Rupiah-U.S. and Korea Won-U.S. dollar exchange rate are slower to revert do the mean (nonlinearly) than depreciations of the same proportionate amount, and the adjustment toward PPP is found to be nonlinear and asymmetric. On the other hand, Brazil/USD, China/USD and Mexico/USD adjustments are found to be nonlinear and symmetric. The governments of these five countries can use PPP to determine whether a currency is overvalued or undervalued, as well as if the country is experiencing differences between domestic and foreign inflation rates.

Such a vast difference of opinions among judges and the verdicts may lead to undesired controversies and disputes in society. It also brings up some implementation issues in the judicial and legal system. Our paper demonstrates that, with help from simple concepts from finance and modern econometrics tools, there is an objective data-driven fact-based approach to identify pump and dump manipulation. The proposed approach is easy to implement, hinges on stock prices only, and can be adaptively updated for ex post identification and ex ante early warning purposes.

Houses are used as collateral in mortgage contracts. Appreciation in prices of houses affects banks' incentive to screen mortgage applications. How securitization affects banks' incentive depends upon the way banks sell their securities backed by mortgages. If banks sell a proportion of their securitized packages, an appreciation of house prices lowers losses from mortgage default, and thus decreases banks' incentives to screen. If banks retain the equity tranche and sell the debt tranche, losses from mortgage default reduce banks' profits and thus banks have more incentives to screen mortgage applicants. However, changes in house prices do not affect the banks' incentives to screen mortgage applicants. Furthermore, if credit expansion by securitization leads banks to expect house-price appreciation in the future, the higher the expected appreciation, the less the expected losses from mortgage default, and the lower the banks' screening incentives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201703-201704100013-201704100013-57-123,45.1,2017,Taiwan Economic Review

The Effects of Demographic Structure Change on Housing Prices,"Chien-Wen Peng, I-Chun Tsai","fertility rate, dependency rate, panel data, cointegration test","The dependency rate is an indicator of demographic structure that usually is used to measure the pressure on productive population. A high dependency ratio can cause serious problems for a country if a large proportion of a government’s expenditure is on health, social security and education, which are most used by the youngest and the oldest in a population. Many previous studies have found that the dependency rate was the main determinant of household saving or wealth accumulation. This study tries further to clarify whether demographic changes, especially the dependency rate, affects housing prices. The empirical results reveal that house prices are cointegrated with the fertility rate and old dependency rate, respectively. In the long run, an increase in the fertility rate increases house prices. However, an increase in the old dependency rate reduces house prices.

Consumption Indivisibility and Optimal Income Taxation,"Chun-Hui Lu, K. L. Glen Ueng","consumption indivisibility, Pareto efficient, optimal income taxation","Traditional literature neglects the impact of indivisibility of goods on the design of optimal income taxation. For this reason, this paper sets up a model based on Stiglitz (1982) with two different kinds of goods: one is the traditional consumption good and the other is the so called indivisible good. It is shown that under the Pareto efficient tax structure, the marginal tax rates on the high (low) ability taxpayers depend not only on the patterns of indivisible goods, but also on whether low (high) ability taxpayers' self-selection and high (low) ability taxpayers' wage threshold constraints are binding. Under the premise that high ability taxpayers will always purchase indivisible goods and the constraints of their wage threshold are binding, the marginal tax rates should be negative rather than zero on the high ability taxpayers, even that the low ability taxpayers' self-selection constraints are not binding. This result is different from traditional models which show that the optimal marginal tax rates on high ability taxpayers are zero. The reason is: being constrained to the wage threshold, lump-sum taxation levied on high ability taxpayers cannot make the net social marginal utility level equal to 1. Hence, reducing marginal tax rates and increasing lump-sum taxes on the high ability taxpayers can make the level of net social marginal utility closer to 1 and thereby improve social efficiency.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201609-201610050017-201610050017-475-509,44.3,2016,Taiwan Economic Review

Does the Stock Market Favor Socially Responsible Firms? Evidence from SEOs,"Chia-Ying Chan, De-Wai Chou, Christine W.

In this study, we examine how these features might influence market participants' preferences with regard to announcement effects of seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) and long-term stock performance. Our pioneering study advances the literature by classifying socially responsible firms into seven groups based on the major category of their CSR activities. Overall, we find that socially responsible firms generate less negative announcement returns in comparison to non-CSR firms on the issuance of SEOs, which suggests that return premiums yield lower discounts for socially responsible firms during SEO events. Furthermore, our findings show that during the announcement period market participants respond favorably to socially responsible firms that focus on environment, community, and governance. Nevertheless, the long-term market performance of socially responsible firms and non-CSR firms is generally similar and differences in abnormal returns are insignificant.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201606-201606280009-201606280009-339-377,44.2,2016,Taiwan Economic Review

Tai","Initial public offerings, underpricing, long term performance, underwriting, information asymmetry","The regulations concerning initial public offerings in Taiwan have been revised many times during the past two decades. This provides plenty of valuable data to empirically test IPO theories. This study reviews the literature related to initial public offerings in Taiwan over the last 15 years. We discuss the empirical evidence found in this literature and try to dig out unexplained issues. In summary, Taiwan’s IPO literature provides empirical evidence on: short-run and long run performance of IPOs, the choice of underwriting method, investors’ bidding behavior and performance, and underwriting fees.

In this paper, we first review the regional context of Asian corporate governance issues, namely ownership structure, internal and external mechanisms and several other specific topics.

Our empirical results indicate that there exist significant spillover effects among industrial indices; that is, the comovement of industries in Taiwan is evident. We also find that while most industries are receivers of spillover effects, a few industries are the main exporters of return and volatility spillover effects. In particular, the construction industry in Taiwan is the key transmitter of spillover effects. In contrast, the electronic industry and financial industry do not have as significant net spillover effects as we expected. Moreover, based on the robustness analysis, we find that key exporters of spillover effects are actually quite different within sub-samples. For instance, the financial industry has the most significant net spillover effects on other industries during the period of the subprime debt crisis in 2008. Finally, we utilize the method of rolling window estimation to illustrate the dynamics of industrial spillover effects. In fact, the results reveal apparently dynamic behavior of industrial spillover effects in the Taiwan stock market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201512-201601080025-201601080025-407-442,43.4,2015,Taiwan Economic Review

However, this line of research focused solely on single-name concentrations under an asymptotic single factor framework. In this study, by adapting the inter-mortgage-pool correlation structure of Hull and White (2010) under the multi-factor setting of Pykhtin (2004) we derive quantitative measures of single-name and sector concentration that facilitate subsequent analysis of the risk profiles embedded in Mortgage Backed Securities (MBSs). Under different stress scenarios, we examine the impact of concentration exposures on the internal credit enhancements, in particular, on the AAA tranche attachment points. We show that, under severe market conditions, the presence of regional concentrations in the underlying mortgage pools can further amplify the effects of default correlation on the portfolio loss distributions.

Choices of Corporate Financing Sources and Dividend Payout Modes: Evidence from the Subprime Mortgage Crisis,Shu-Lin Yang,"financing sources, payout modes, subprime mortgage crisis","This study investigates the changes in dividend payout modes and financing sources made by firms during the subprime mortgage crisis, as well as the interaction between these two financial decisions. In order to mitigate the effects of information asymmetry, I focus on the Taiwanese companies for which data on domestic credit ratings are publicly available for the years 2006 through 2010. The empirical results indicate that the probability of initiating a stock repurchase program was higher than the probability of paying cash dividends during the subprime mortgage crisis. At the same time, bank loans undertaken by firms increased due to their higher financial flexibility, and seasoned equity offerings decreased. In addition, the changes in financing sources substantially influenced how firms chose their dividend payment modes. The overall evidence suggests that when firms experience an external credit crunch, financial flexibility is the key factor that dominates their financing and dividend-payout decisions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201512-201601080025-201601080025-495-547,43.4,2015,Taiwan Economic Review

The preliminary results do not show a significant association between D&Oinsurance and the occurrence of financial statement restatements. However, further exploring the association between D&O insurance coverage and financial statement restatements for firms with D&O insurance, we find that D&O insurance coverage has a significant impact on the incident of financial statement restatements. If the firm purchases appropriate (normal) D&O insurance coverage that suits the firm's specific characteristics and risk, the likelihood of restatements will decrease. However, if the firm purchases excess (abnormal) D&O insurance coverage the likelihood of restatements will increase. This implies that abnormal D&O insurance coverage would have adverse effect on the directors' and managers' behaviors, and increase the probability of restatements.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201512-201601080025-201601080025-549-588,43.4,2015,Taiwan Economic Review

We first estimate the time-varying conditional covariances by dynamic conditional correlations models, and then treat the estimates as explanatory variables in a second-stage panel quantile regression to explore the shape of the conditional distribution of excess returns. A significant positive intertemporal relation between risk and return is identified at the conditional mean and median of the expected return distribution. This positive risk-return relation coincides with the result implied by interactive-effects panel data models and fits into the conditional expectation framework of the ICAPM allowing for cross-sectional dependence.

The Impact of Diabetes on Employment among Middle-Aged and Older Taiwanese: The Moderating Effect of Weight Control,"Dong-Long Lin, Teng-Yuan Hu","diabetes, employment, weight control, trivariate probit model","This study examines whether weight control ameliorates the effect of diabetes on employment among middle-aged and older adults (aged 40 to 64) by gender and weight group. It analyzes two waves of the National Health Interview Survey of Taiwan (2001, 2005). Allowing for endogeneity of diabetes and weight control, it uses a trivariate probit model with instrumental variables, including the family history of diabetes, area prevalence rates of diabetes and weight control. Due to lack of family history of diabetes and insufficient variations in the two area prevalence rates, the findings from the 2001 wave are not totally according to expectation. However, the analysis of the 2005 data does not suffer similar constraints. The moderating effect for overweight or obese (defined as BMI ≥ 24) males is statistically significant, on the order of 1.98%. Most effects are either small or insignificant for other groups. Taking into account the moderating effect for overweight or obese, middle-aged and older males will enhance completeness of cost-benefit analysis in evaluating weight control policy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201509-201509230010-201509230010-359-405,43.3,2015,Taiwan Economic Review

A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with endogenous working and saving decisions is employed to quantify the impact. Taiwan, which has been implementing its National Health Insurance (NHI) since 1995 and whose elderly population ratio will double within 20 years, is selected as an example for our analysis. Our results suggest that an additional 16 percent labor income tax will be required in 2050 if the current trend of population aging cannot be improved. Moreover, the impact of medical price inflation is also discussed.

Asymmetric Information and Alternative Government Financing: A Comparison,Fu-Sheng Hung,"asymmetric information, credit rationing, money and income-tax financing, endogenous growth","This paper compares the relative merits of alternative government financing in the presence of asymmetric information. We first establish that the share of government expenditure determines whether or not credit is rationed, which in turn plays an important role in determining the relative merits of monetary and income-tax financing. It is found that monetary financing leads to both higher inflation and economic growth than income-tax financing if credit is not rationed. If credit is rationed, however, monetary financing leads to a higher inflation rate but a lower growth rate than tax financing. In comparing social welfare, we find that monetary (income-tax) financing is better than income-tax (monetary) if credit is not rationed (rationed).

Bank Lending Behavior and a Credit Channel in Monetary Transmission: Evidence from Taiwan,"Chao-Hsi Huang, Li-Hsuan Yu","monetary transmission, credit channel, bank loan portfolio","This paper studies the role that bank loans have played in Taiwan's monetary transmission using data on bank loan components in Taiwan. We estimate VAR models consisting of a set of core macroeconomic variables and various bank loan components, and examine the impulse responses of these loan components to a monetary tightening and a real aggregate demand downturn. We find that business loans and secured loans increase while consumer loans and unsecured loans decline after a monetary tightening. In contrast, we find that the above response patterns of bank loans are generally absent during a real aggregate demand downturn. Our findings suggest that bankers' decisions concerning loan portfolios have contributed to the observed changes in loan components after a monetary tightening, confirming the role of a ＂credit channel＂ in Taiwan's monetary transmission.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201506-201507060024-201507060024-219-242,43.2,2015,Taiwan Economic Review

Conventional wisdomindicates that in a Benhabib-Farmer-Guo one-sector model, a progressive tax schedule operates like an automatic stabilizer that mitigates business cycle fluctuations, but in an indeterminate two-sector real business cycle model a regressive, rather than a progressive, tax policy stabilizes the economy against sunspot-driven fluctuations. This paper proposes an alternative policy - an income tax-cum-consumption tax schedule-to stabilize the economy against sunspot fluctuations. We show numerically that the government can suppress belief-driven fluctuations by implementing a tax switch decreasing the income tax and increasing the consumption tax.

Our results suggest that during the sample period, while Taiwanese exports became more focused on products with longer quality ladders, they also fell further away from the world quality frontiers. This occurs because Taiwanese lost their quality advantage in existing products, and also because Taiwanese attempted to make a transition to products they initially did not have advantage in. We also study the evolution of product quality in different sectors, and our results suggest that while the trends look similar across sectors, there appears to be substantial heterogeneity in terms of the actual timing and causes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201503-201504200030-201504200030-1-51,43.1,2015,Taiwan Economic Review
Endogenous Delegation Decisions in an Oligopoly Model,"Chia-Hung Sun, Ruey-Yih Lin","endogenous delegation, Stackelberg solution, quantity competition","This study investigates a three-stage game of delegation choice, incentive contract choice, and subsequent quantity choice with a general number of firms. Profit-maximizing owners of firms choose whether to delegate or not to delegate in the first stage, and those firms that choose to delegate decide their incentive contract in the second stage. In the third stage, the owners or managers compete in quantity according to their respective objectives. With linear demand functions and symmetric cost functions, we show that if there are more than three firms in the market and the cost of hiring a manager and production costs are relatively high, or the market size is relatively small, then all firms choose not to delegate. If the costs of hiring a manager and production cost are relatively low, or the market size is relatively large, then all firms choose to delegate. If the cost of hiring a manager, production costs, or the market size is relatively moderate, then some firms choose to delegate, while the others choose not to delegate.

However, the literature ignores the fact that the social welfare produced by the different routes is roughly equal. This paper explores a product commercialization R&D competition in which firms attempt to reduce the cost of a new product so it can be commercialized. The social welfare produced by two possible routes is compared assuming two technologies to provide a product consisting of two modules. On one path one firms leads in lowering the price of both modules and on the other each firm leads in lowering the cost of one module. This paper finds that the social welfare of a path is determined by the relative importance of the efficiency effect and the profit dissipation effect. On path one, there is weaker competition in R&D and the product market, but path one produces higher social welfare because it has both a higher efficiency effect and a lower profit dissipation effect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201503-201504200030-201504200030-89-117,43.1,2015,Taiwan Economic Review

It is found that tariffication is socially undesirable for the domestic country no matter whether the manufacturer adopts one-part or two-part tariff pricing. But the effects of pricing on the manufacturer's R&D are very different. If the domestic manufacturer adopts two-part (one-part) tariff pricing, tariffication discourages (has no effect on) the R&D investment of the domestic manufacturer.

Government agents follow exogenous trading policies, only accept and hold domestic currency. When domestic currency inflates slightly, increasing the trading probabilities of government and private agents, domestic currency appreciates due to increased demand for domestic currency as long as private agents accept and hold domestic and foreign currencies. As the domestic inflation rate goes up the decrease in the rate of return of domestic currency becomes the dominant effect, and thus the domestic currency value declines. When government demand for overseas goods is very large, foreign sellers accept domestic currency even if the cost of verifying this domestic currency is high.

Firm 1, armed with superior pollution abatement technology, must decide on how much technology to share with firm 2. Meanwhile, firm 2 must determine how much of the available technology to adopt. Though inspired by Endres and Friehe (2011), which investigates a related issue under environmental laws of strict liability and negligence rules, this paper differs crucially in two fundamental aspects: we consider a proportional liability rule and costly technology diffusion.

Using their overwhelming buying-power in the world market for components, the multinationals have a dominant position and set an exploitatively lower level of prices in the international components market. In this article, we find that the government of an exporting country can use an export tax to counter the monopsony or oligopsony power of the multinationals. However, the optimal trade policy for exported components shall revert to an export subsidy once the component producers in the export country have outside options to sell their products to potential buyers, or to establish their own brands and sale channels. Meanwhile, we have extended the analytic model to a situation of bi-sourcing; that is, the multinational firms can manufacture a portion of their components in house (insourcing) and acquire the same inputs from external suppliers (outsourcing).

Analysis of the Demographic Distribution of the Minority Groups Facing Discrimination under Incomplete Information,"Wan-Ju Wang, Wei-Torng Juang","incomplete information, networks, discrimination, clustering","Racial clustering is common in a multiracial society. One possible explanation is that people prefer their own kind. This paper constructs a model in which the majority group discriminates against the minority group purely based on the latter's crime rate instead of other outer characteristics such as race or skin. We find that even though the crime rates of all groups are equal ex ante, the minority group still tends to cluster. This is so because the majority group could still discriminate against the minority group due to misjudgments under incomplete information. Such misjudgments come from the high variation of crime rates in small samples. Therefore, the minority group can reduce the probability of being discriminated against by clustering to reduce the variation of its crime rate. We also illustrates the effect other relevant parameters have on the minority group's clustering behavior and test the results with simulations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201409-201410270004-201410270004-363-404,42.3,2014,Taiwan Economic Review

This paper develops a simple model to answer this question from the perspective of political economics. It is shown that, under some conditions, the distribution of wealth, social structure and economic performance emerge as long-run steady equilibrium outcomes depending on the initial wealth distribution, the political investment cost and the credit market’s imperfection. The more unequal the initial wealth distribution or the higher the political investment cost or the greater the degree of imperfection in the credit market, the less the individuals are able to invest in political capital. Therefore, the political market is less competitive and the incumbent political elite can levy a high tax on the middle class. This not only worsens wealth inequality but also undermines economic development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201409-201410270004-201410270004-405-451,42.3,2014,Taiwan Economic Review
Income Tax and Labor Supply: Evidence from an EITC Simulation in Taiwan,"Chih-Chin Ho, Fu-Li Chen, Hui-Lin Lin, Eric S. Lin ","EITC, earned income tax credit, labor supply, manpower utilization survey, survey of family income and expenditure","Nowadays Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has become one of the most expensive and fastest growing social welfare programs in America. As a result of the success of the EITC in America, this program has also been successfully instituted in many other countries. This paper evaluates the potential effect of an EITC on labor supply in Taiwan. The traditional econometric methods estimating reduced form labor supply by a Tobit or OLS will lead to serious endogeneity problems, when labor faces a kink-point-piecewise-linear budget. We apply the Two Error Model (TEM) in Triest (1990) to overcome this issue. Our finding reveals first that wives' labor hours tend to cluster more at the kink point than husbands do, and the elasticity of substitution for wives is larger than that for husbands. Secondly, the simulation of an EITC shows that when the largest tax credit rises, workers' labor hours are likely to be in the largest tax credit region. When the largest tax credit is 48,000, phase-in and phase-out rates are 40% and 20% respectively. An EITC program could cause a husband and wife on average to reduce their labor hours 6.9% and 8.4% respectively. Finally, no matter what the largest tax credit is, on average, the EITC program will encourage about 59% of non-working family to work.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201406-201409160004-201409160004-167-213,42.2,2014,Taiwan Economic Review
Analyzing the Effect of School Characteristics and Geographical Distance on Local Housing Price-The Case of Taipei City,"Chung-Liang Lin, Jia-Huey Lin","full enrollment school district, hedonic pricing method, propensity score matching, housing price","This paper analyzes the effects of school characteristics and geographical distances on local housing prices, and further discusses these effects within different geographical areas. According to the housing price data from the years 2007 to 2009, merged together from the Department of Land Administration and Taipei Real-estate Database, we find that the housing price is higher if the house is located in a full enrollment school district and the magnitude of this effect is decreasing with geographical distance from the school. In addition, we also find that the distance from the house location to a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station plays an important role in increasing the local housing price. As for the analysis of the different geographical areas, the results also show that the magnitude of the effect of school characteristics on the housing price is decreasing with the distance from the house location to the school. We then find that the proximity to an MRT station raises the local housing price and the effect is only significant in the non-full enrollment school districts. Moreover, to reduce the sample selection bias, we use the Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method to analyze the impact of a full enrollment school district on the housing price by using the matching data and we do not find conflicting results. Finally, the empirical results suggest that the housing's own characteristics are the most important factors to affect the local housing price in multi-school districts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201406-201409160004-201409160004-215-271,42.2,2014,Taiwan Economic Review

With a free entry upstream industry, a more competitive downstream market increases the derived demand for inputs, but the input price will, instead of increasing, decrease. Furthermore, an especially noteworthy result of this paper, which is in sharp contrast to the implications of the existing literature, is that a more competitive downstream market causes each downstream firm's output to decrease, but may induce each downstream firm to increase R&D.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201406-201409160004-201409160004-273-296,42.2,2014,Taiwan Economic Review

Mark Stability and Trading Mechnism: Evidence from Taiwan Futures Market,"Chang Chan, Jie-Huan Lee","call auction, continuos auction, volatility, Taiwan futures market, financial crisis","This research investigates why the market volatility of call auctions is different from that of continuous auctions, using the shift from call auctions (one clearing every 10 seconds) to continuous auctions in the Taiwan Futures Exchange. Through an empirical study of 5,000,000 intraday transactions, we find that there is lower temporary price volatility in call auctions. The lower volatility of call auctions is due to two major reasons: first, the bid ask bounce in call auctions is moderate; second, more participants join each transaction in call auctions therefore the transaction price deviates less from the equilibrium value. Moreover, we also find that call auctions may stabilize market prices, especially under the following two circumstances: first, when information is highly asymmetric; second, when an instrument is more actively traded. The findings of this research help to explain why the major stock markets in the world adopt call auctions and why a trading halt is implemented when the market is unstable. The result also offers the governing authority a way to choose financial-market-stabilizing information.

Using a sample of Taiwan listed companies (excluding the financial industry) from 2006 to 2010, this study examines the relation between credit rating downgrades and CEO compensation, and the moderating effects of board independence, expertise, and attendance. The empirical results show a decrease (increase) in CEO compensation following company credit rating downgrades (upgrades), and the relation becomes more significant when the credit rating changes from low to high risk. In addition, quantile regression tests find that the magnitude of the decrease (increase) grows when CEO compensation is in a high quantile. The greater the independence, expertise, and attendance of a company's board, the more efficient the company will be. After a company's credit rating is downgraded, CEO compensation is also decreased.

We argue that the report made by the employer can become a tool used to control the worker's incentive to work.

Durable Goods Monopoly with Network Effects,Cheng-Tai Wu,"durable goods monopoly, network externality, coase conjecture","This paper examines the pricing behavior of a monopoly in a durable goods market with non-delayed network effects. Network externalities ensure that each consumer will have a strictly positive willingness to pay for holding the goods, which in turn implies that the trading process must end within a finite time. The monopolist faces a trade-off between the respective benefits of price discrimination and accelerating the trading process, and the effect of the non-delayed network effects is to increase the latter benefit; therefore, equilibrium prices must decrease over time. We show that there exists a unique stationary equilibrium, and that the Coase conjecture holds in equilibrium. Furthermore, when the network effects are sufficiently strong, the monopolist will flood the market immediately. We also provide examples in which equilibrium prices and states can be explicitly computed. The comparative statics results suggest that the stronger the network effects, the more quickly the whole market will be covered.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201312-201312240018-201312240018-365-401,41.4,2013,Taiwan Economic Review

Based on this framework, the effects of the increase in foreign prices of both intermediate inputs and final goods on the domestic price, output, employment and real exchange rate dynamics will be studied. The trade elasticities, the cost elasticity of holding the currency mix, the average propensity to import out of expenditure, and the degree of dependence on imported intermediate inputs are crucial in influencing the steady-state and impact effects as well as dynamic adjustment paths. When the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, the adjustment of real exchange rates exhibits saddle-path stability.

The simulations show that: (1) an increase in the education quota of the public/private university will raise intergenerational upward mobility and lessen the reverse income distribution, but at the same time will widen the wage inequality and increase the Gini coefficient; (2) an increase in the public education subsidies will raise (not decrease) the wage inequality and Gini coefficient; (3) an increase in the tuition fees of the public university will reduce the intergenerational upward mobility slightly, but will improve the reverse income distribution significantly.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201312-201312240018-201312240018-443-484,41.4,2013,Taiwan Economic Review

These changes may lead to a structural change of the New-Keynesian Phillips curve. This paper constructs a small open stochastic general equilibrium model and derives the New-Keynesian Phillips curve to examine the effects of finance reform and monetary policy change on the slope of the curve. The results show that besides financial reform, the monetary policy change which stabilized the price level was a main factor increasing slack in the New-Keynesian Phillips curve after 1988. To confirm the conclusions above, we employ a state-space model and AR(p) to obtain expected inflation, and then estimate the slope of the reduced form Phillips curve. This supports the above conclusion.

This study aims to test this hypothesis by utilizing a detailed data set consisting of more than two thousand villages in Taiwan surveyed around 1903 and 1915. The empirical findings show the effect of established stations that opened before 1903 on land productivity was insignificant during 1903-1915. However, land productivity in villages near new stations opening during 1903-1915 increased more than that of other villages during the same period. Moreover, based on the estimation of an agricultural production function with Cobb-Douglas form, the total value of output of the villages nearest to new stations increased more than 20% during 1903-1915 while production inputs remained constant.

This finding contradicts the conclusion from earlier related literature that counterfeiting would necessarily cause both the price and profit of genuine products to fall.

In the import model, there is a monopoly in the domestic intermediate good market. One domestic downstream firm generates pollution during production and competes against one foreign firm in the domestic downstream market. When the domestic environmental tax is endogenous, the presence of the intermediate good market increases the reduction of the optimal environmental tax caused by trade liberalization. Moreover, trade liberalization increases the domestic pollution and may lower domestic welfare. No matter whether the intermediate good market is monopolistic or perfectly competitive, under the optimal environmental tax the effects of trade liberalization on domestic pollution and welfare stay the same.

When the trade cost is high and the abatement technology is efficient, a higher emission tax rate may encourage FDI. Moreover, under plausible parameters, raising the emission tax to drive the foreign firm out of the host country will be detrimental to environmental quality but raise consumer surplus in the host country.

With growing importance of operations in China, it is essential to understand how FDI in China affects operation of the parent firms and their mode of serving foreign markets. This paper addresses this issue by empirically investigating whether FDI in China displaces or promotes parent firms' exports. By using a unique firm-level data set that links approved investment projects and realized amount of FDI in China to financial statements and exports data of firms listed on Taiwan Stock Exchange from 1992 to 2006, a period of sharp increase in FDI in China, we are able to examine whether FDI in China substitutes or complements exports from home. We adopt three alternative empirical models: panel regressions with fixed effects, a panel Tobit model and a dynamic panel model. We find that FDI in China reduces parent firms' exports, suggesting a substitutive relationship. Interestingly enough, the effect pertains to firms in both non-electronics industries and the electronics industry - which is characterized by dense production networks and surging investment in China in recent years.

We develop a general equilibrium framework of endogenous sorting in which agents are allowed to differ in their incomes, opportunity costs of commuting, and preferences for housing quality. Housing quality is endogenously determined by location-specific public infrastructure that is financed by property taxes. We characterize the configuration of the competitive spatial equilibrium. We find that complete integration arises only under a set of parameters of measure zero such that the ratio of the opportunity costs of commuting facing different types of agents is in a specific homothetic relation to the ratio of the marginal valuations of housing quality. By contrast, locational stratification is generic. When the difference between agents' commuting costs is sufficiently large (resp. small) compared to the difference in their respective preferences for housing quality, the equilibrium is segregated with all rich residing in the central city (resp. suburb) as observed in Asia and Europe (resp.

The licensor can adopt either fixed-fee or royalty licensing. It is found that the licensor firm may prefer fixed-fee to royalty licensing as the former is more likely to induce downstream entry which expands the derived demand.

Specifically, it is concerned with the firm's optimal hierarchical structure and the corresponding incentive contracts for the managers as a function of variables which are related to the degree of market competition, when the middle manager's sole function is information-gathering. Consistent with recent empirical literature, we show that under one measure of market competitiveness, an increase in competitiveness leads the firm to flatten its hierarchy and offer stronger incentives to its agents.

The first financial reform aimed to raise capital adequacy ratios and reduce nonperforming loans. The second financial reform encouraged banks to merge. We investigate the impact of the reforms on market competition and consumers' welfare. Using a structural demand model for saving and borrowing in a differentiated market, we find that a bank's capital adequacy rate has a positive impact on the utility of both savers and borrowers. Contrarily, the ratio of non-performing loans has no significant effect. During these reform periods, market competition tended to decline while consumers' welfare dropped for both savers and borrowers. Nonetheless, when we use counterfactual experiments to isolate the direct effect of reform policies from other factors, we find that the first reform had almost no effect on market competition while raising both savers' and borrowers' welfare.

This study shows that the relative magnitude among the households' elasticity of marginal utility to consumption, the initial relative share of labor and energy inputs, the proportion of pollution outputs to energy inputs, the elasticity of labor supply, and the elasticity of export demand are the critical determinants of whether there may be a double dividend effect. The results imply that the consumer's subjective attitude, the structure of the tax, the status of the current economy, and the relative degree of domestic economic development compared to abroad should be considered when the government attempts to achieve a double dividend through the imposition of an energy tax.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201212-201301230017-201301230017-461-480,40.4,2012,Taiwan Economic Review
Estimates of Education Production Functions: The Effectiveness of School Inputs and Parental Financial Resources,Wehn-Jyuan Tsai,"education production function, value-added specification, school resources, high school","A key element of the policy discussion surrounding schools has been the effectiveness of additional resources in raising student achievement. This study uses the 2001-2003 Taiwanese Joint College Entrance Examination (JCEE) files to estimate a value-added production function for achievement by high school students. We use the score on a compentency test as a student's lagged test score and use teacher-student ratios to measure school expenditure, the average score on the competency test within schools to measure school rankings and cram schooling expenditure to measure parental financial resources. The empirical results suggest that for the most prestigious schools higher school expenditure (higher teacher-student ratios) raises the standardized JCEE scores of high school graduates. Moreover, the estimates show that an increase in parental financial resources increases the standardized scores on Chinese, English and History.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201212-201301230017-201301230017-481-513,40.4,2012,Taiwan Economic Review

The empirical study applies G20 countries panel data for the period of 1997 through 2008. Also incorporated in the theoretical framework is Krugman's New Economic Geography theory (1991), which employs a spatial error model to estimate the causal relationships between R&D investment, human qualities, government policies, industrial agglomeration, and knowledge production. The results of this study show that R&D funding, per capita income, the number of researchers, and industrial agglomerations have positive direct effects on domestic knowledge production for G20 countries. Another important finding is the spillover effect from the neighboring countries: R&D funding, education enrollment, and education expenditures from neighboring countries have a positive impact on domestic knowledge production for G20 countries. However, when a large number of researchers are recruited by neighboring countries and industrial agglomeration in neighboring countries rises, a significant negative impact on knowledge production is observed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201212-201301230017-201301230017-515-538,40.4,2012,Taiwan Economic Review

A Study on the Implementation of a Flat Rate Income Tax Reform in Taiwan,"Keh-Nan Sun, Shi-Wan Lou","tax-burden distribution, flat tax, single allowance, separate system, Gini coeﬃcient","A flat tax system is a system with a single proportional tax rate, instead of a system of progressive tax rates. It is a tax system with a simple personal allowance, instead of a system with various tax preferences. In Taiwan, corporate income tax is based on the adoption of a 17% single tax rate, but individual income tax has remained progressive and is characterized by various types of tax relief, which have made the current system appear both complicated and unfair. We thus analyze the feasibility of adopting a flat tax system in Taiwan to replace the current system in order to create a fairer and more simple tax system. This paper derives several results. Firstly, the higher the allowance in a flat tax system, the fairer is the tax system. In addition, a proportional tax system results in regressive taxes. Secondly, as for the introduction of a flat tax system, a system with a relatively high tax rate and a higher allowance will be fairer than a system with a relatively low tax rate and a lower allowance. Thirdly, if Taiwan adopts the flat tax system with a single tax rate of 20% and a single allowance of NT$340,000, it can promote tax equity and simplify the tax administration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201209-201212270015-201212270015-325-367,40.3,2012,Taiwan Economic Review

The results indicate that if revenue sharing acts as an efficiency wage, performance pay seeking can be a driving force behind labor productivity and in turn economic growth without any factor externalities. However, a more intensive sharing scheme may not necessarily increase employment, capital utilization, or economic growth. The current analysis also shows that capital utilization and economic growth always exhibit a positive relationship with each other, whereas employment may be either pro-cyclical or countercyclical in relation to capital utilization and balanced growth rates, which crucially depend on different shocks.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201209-201212270015-201212270015-369-388,40.3,2012,Taiwan Economic Review
Noncompliance with the Estate Tax in Taiwan,"Shih-Tang Hwu, Shih-Ying Wu","the estate tax, tax noncompliance, tax audit","Tax noncompliance affects not only government revenue but also the fairness of the tax system. However, empirical studies on noncompliance with the estate tax are rare. This study utilizes the audited estate tax returns for 1993-1998 and 2003-2005 from Taiwan's National Tax Administration to analyze the determinants and magnitude of the underreporting of estates. We find that the underreporting of estates increases with marginal tax rates and the amount of the estate, but declines with tax auditing. The results are consistent with most of previous theoretical and empirical studies on non-compliance with the income tax and the estate tax. Previous studies generally find that a tax increase raises taxpayers' incentive to underreport estates owing to a higher marginal reward of successful evasion. In contrast, a higher tax audit probability can effectively deter taxpayers' underreporting behavior. One limitation of this study is that the data from audited tax returns may reveal only a part of actual noncompliance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201209-201212270015-201212270015-389-420,40.3,2012,Taiwan Economic Review

The sample for this study consists of those banks that had Fitch's Bank Individual Ratings (FBRs) during 2002-2005. There are 3,881 observations from 91countries, including 3433 solicited ratings and 448 unsolicited ratings. By employing marching methods developed by Rubin (1973) and Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983, 1985a,b), four matching algorithms, Nearest, Caliper, Mahala and Mahala Caliper, are used to match the financial characteristics of two groups of banks in order to correct for sample selection bias. Our evidence shows that before sample matching, banks received unsolicited ratings have weaker financial profiles and this could partially explain why they also get lower ratings.

The Effect of Three-Seven-Five Rent Reduction on the Management Efficiency of Taiwan's Rice Farms,Shu-Jen Yeh,"three-seven-five rent reduction, technical efficiency, the ratio of adjusted profit to adjusted cost, fixed rent tenancy, share tenancy","This article explores whether or not the improvement in management efficiency from 1925-27 to 1950-51 was greater in tenanted farms than in self-cultivated farms, focusing on the possible impact of the Three-Seven-Five Rent Reduction reform implemented in 1949. The empirical results, based on the difference-in-difference approach, suggest that the impact is likely to be limited as the change in management efficiency between the two periods for the tenanted farms is highly similar to that for the self-cultivated farms. This finding is inconsistent with Chen Cheng's statement that the reform enhanced tenants' work incentive. Further results show that the impact of the reform on a more general efficiency index, measured by an adjusted profit-cost ratio, does not differ between the two types of farm after farm type, time period, rice type, and farm size are controlled in the estimations. Possible reconcilations for the neutrality of the policy effects could be (1) the reform resulted in a fixed rent tenancy system for the tenanted farms; (2) there was no substantial difference in the production function, factor prices or price of product faced by the two types of farm after the reform; and (3) the reform did not interfere with the management entitlement of the tenanted farms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201206-201207050002-201207050002-189-233,40.2,2012,Taiwan Economic Review
Trade Liberalization and Intermediate Goods Market Structure,"Kuang-I Tu, Jiunn-Rong Chiou","trade liberalization, intermediate goods, market structure","The effects of trade liberalization on the final product are analyzed when the importing (domestic) country possesses an intermediate goods market. It is assumed the intermediate goods provided by the domestic upstream firm are indispensible for producing the domestic final goods. This paper finds that even though the foreign final-product firm has not yet started exporting goods to the domestic market, the domestic input price may slump quickly because of the tariff reduction. Consequently, the output and profit of the domestic final-product firm will increase due to trade liberalization. This finding contradicts what is commonly believed. In addition, if the home country has an exogenous market structure for intermediate goods, the optimal tariff for the domestic country would be lower than that without an intermediate goods market. However, if the domestic intermediate goods market structure is endogenous, then the domestic government should raise the tariff within a certain range to protect the domestic industry. Yet, if the domestic intermediate good firm has a very high fixed costs, then the domestic government should do the reverse by reducing the tariff to a level that is lower than when the intermediate goods market structure is exogenous and let the foreign firm monopolize the market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201206-201207050002-201207050002-235-260,40.2,2012,Taiwan Economic Review

Initial ability is represented by the score of the basic competence test taken when the student enters senior high school. The present study finds that family background determines participation in cram schools, and the OLS results might overestimate the effect of cram schooling. If initial ability is not controlled, the participation in cram schooling increases the score on the general scholastic ability test (GSAT) for those who participate. After controlling for initial ability in the regression, cram schooling still increase the GSAT, but the magnitudes and degree of significance of the effect substantially decline When both self-selection and initial ability are considered, the effect of cram schooling is not significant, regardless of whether the effect of cram schooling is specified as linear or decreasing. Finally, both students who participate in cram schooling and those who do not earn higher scores on GSAT than if they had chosen differently.

(2) Before age 29, young female's age acceptance rates are much higher than young male's. After age 29, both males and females have similar decreasing rates After comparing the ”availability index”, this paper suggests that the advantage of older men in the marriage market may be based on ”age and resource exchange” (a male can use his increasing income to substitute for his decreasing physical attractiveness easier than a female), and nor an ”initial age preference ” or ”population demographics” (the sex ratio and age difference in the unmarried population).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201203-201205010001-201205010001-121-148,40.1,2012,Taiwan Economic Review

We examined the exports of 11 economies over the period 2000-2009 and found overshooting did occur during the 2001 and 2008 crises. The overshooting, however, was more severe in Taiwan than in other countries, and in the 2008 crisis than in the 2001 crisis. We argue that the bullwhip effect is a major driving force behind the ”export overshooting” phenomenon. Following this line of argument, Taiwan’s increasing susceptibility to economic crisis can be attributed to an increase in cross-border vertical specialization, offshore outsourcing of downstream production and the concentration of her exports in high-tech products that are sensitive to demand shocks.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201112-201203020007-201203020007-3-40,39.4,2011,Taiwan Economic Review

In the bull market, investors have a slower response to bad earning news because investors, having more confidence in the prosperous market, pay less attention to the bad earnings news, and also because in the bull market where the investors have better investment performance, the loss caused by the bad earning news is comparatively small in their mental account.

A common problem with many studies, however, is omitted variable bias and reverse causality in the observed correlation between sex ratios and socioeconomic outcomes. This paper exploits the natural experiment provided by the Chinese migration during the period from 1946 through 1951 to identify the effect of sex ratios on the native-born generation. The empirical results suggest that high sex ratios had a large positive effect on the likelihood of female marriage, family size and the homeownership rate, and a large negative effect on female labor force participation. The empirical results thus provide evidence consistent with the theory of marriage in which an increase in the sex ratio increases female bargaining power in the marriage market, leading to a change in socioeconomic outcomes that is favorable for women.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201112-201203020007-201203020007-89-118,39.4,2011,Taiwan Economic Review

The main findings of the paper are as follows. Firstly, owing to an inability to flexibly manufacture, the consignor would choose to subcontract out its production even if the production cost of the subcontracting firm is higher than that of the consignor, when the variance, i.e., risk, of a demand shock is large. Secondly, when subcontracting does not occur, the cosigner's capacity investment increases as the variance or the mean of a demand shock rises. However, given that subcontracting occurs, the consignor's capacity investment will decrease as the variance of a demand shock rises. Thirdly, the smaller the consignor's marginal cost of capacity investment, the less the possibility of the emergence of subcontracting due to a fall in the comparative advantage of the flexible manufacturing owned by the subcontracting firm.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201109-201110120010-201110120010-373-402,39.3,2011,Taiwan Economic Review

Unlike the existing literature, which by and large, used the natural area of the whole island as the measuring reference, we take the effective political territory as the denominator. This adaption makes the presentation of the cross-century population density of Taiwan more plausible than conventional presentations in that the five successive political regimes of Taiwan each had a distinct sense of sovereignty as well as territory. Using the area of the whole island to estimate the population density of Taiwan before the 20th century would be misleading since the political territories did not dominate the whole island.

Income Inequality and Crime: A Study Based on Regional Dynamic Panel Data from Taiwan,"Mon-Chi Lio, Ching-Chih Lu","income inequality, gini coefficient, crime rate, dynamic panel data","This paper applies the system GMM approach along with a traditional OLS and fixed-effect model to investigate the impact of income inequality on various crime rates based on Taiwan's regional data from 1998 to 2005. In the models without time dummy variables, we find that all models consistently show that the Gini coefficient, the income inequality measure we use in this paper, has significantly positive impact on common theft, murder and forcible rape. The estimation from the system GMM approach also implies that the income inequality leads to higher crime rates and especially higher violent crime rates. Once we introduce time dummy into our models, all approaches show that the common theft and murder rate are higher with greater income inequality, which is also consistent with the connection between income inequality and the murder rate found in the literature from other countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201106-201107230018-201107230018-243-276,39.2,2011,Taiwan Economic Review
A Study of the Biofuel Blend Ratio Policy,"Ming-Feng Hung, Jhy-Hwa Chen, Daigee Shaw, Wei-Wei Lin","bioenergy, biofuel blend ratio, energy policy, fossil fuel price, food price","The biofuel blend ratio policy is one of the most widely applied measures to develop bioenergy The theoretical basis of this policy is, however, very weak. The main contribution of this paper is to specify a theoretical model that considers the energy and agricultural feedstock markets and externalities from the consumption of energy. Other things equal, we find that an increase in the biofuel blend ratio increases the equilibrium prices of biofuel and feedstock; an increase in fossil fuel price, however, decreases the equilibrium prices of biofuel and feedstock. Furthermore, if the problem of the greenhouse effect is serious, the optimal blend ratio should be raised when the greenhouse gas reduction technology of biofuel improves. However, the optimal adjustment of blend ratio to an increase in fossil fuel prices internationally is indeterminate. It depends on the relative magnitudes of several competing effects-in particular the utility impact on consumers and the externality of energy use.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201106-201107230018-201107230018-277-298,39.2,2011,Taiwan Economic Review

Specifically, the DGBAS forecasting error sequence has significant autocorrelation of order one and is correlated with the macroeconomic diffusion indexes. This motivates us to propose a set of models for updating the DGBAS forecast. Among these models, the simplest one needs only the current DGBAS forecast and the previous DGBAS forecasting error, and the best model extends this simple model by including certain properly selected diffusion indexes as explanatory variables.

Estimation results support the heterogeneous-ability hypothesis for wage distribution and cast doubt on the average rate of return to education calculated by the traditional OLS estimation method. The results show that heterogeneity is strongest within the young cohorts; education and ability are complements in the older cohorts and are substitutes in the younger cohorts. This implies that the younger the cohort is and the stronger the complementary effect will be between education and ability, and thus education may reinforce individuals' heterogeneity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201101-201105090001-201105090001-81-113,39.1,2011,Taiwan Economic Review

The main aims of these reforms has been to lower excessive competition among financial institutions by raising their concentration and to improve the efficiency of financial institutions. This paper presents an empirical study on the impact of bank concentration and bank efficiency on bank competition in Taiwan from 1996 to 2007.

Currency is subject to thefts, while costly technology of record keeping and monitoring is needed for accepting debit cards. When the acceptability of debit cards (which implies liquidity of bank deposits) is endogenously determined, there may exist multiple equilibria. In the equilibrium with a lower acceptance rate of debit cards, higher inflation raises the liquidity of bank deposits and output, in contrast to the case in which the acceptability of debit cards is exogenously imposed.

This paper studies the effect of such a work-hour reduction on labor productivity. We employ quantile regression models and estimate the effects for industries at a one-digit level and a two-digit level. The main findings are as follows. First, the effects are different from those found using OLS regression models, with different effects in different industries and in different quantiles. Second, using the service industry as a reference industry, the manufacturing industry had lower labor productivity when the two-day weekend was put in effect, labor productivity in the manufacturing industry was increased but this was not statistically significant. Third, the effects are different among manufacturing industries at the two-digit level. Using the service industry as a reference industry, the labor productivity in the information and electronics industry was not significantly affected.

PDs are allowed to depend on expected stock returns, which represent the systematic factor, as well as return thresholds based on risk ratings. LGDs are assumed to depend on asset values and equity/debt ratios, in which asset values are decomposed into three components with different ”guarantee powers” while equity/debt ratios are also assumed to be affected by the systematic factor. The key idea of this joint model is that PD and LGD are both affected by the systematic factor and therefore correlated. We find from our simulation results that the VaR is larger than it would be with fixed LGD and that LGD correlations among corporate obligators as well as LGD heterogeneity have substantial influence over VaR. The main conclusion therefore is that credit risk can be seriously underestimated by neglecting the correlation between PD and LGD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201012-201101100070-201101100070-561-592,38.4,2010,Taiwan Economic Review

Our finding indicates that inefficiencies in the Taiwanese banking industry decreased as the financial storm of credit and cash card debts cleared. And the Taiwanese banking industry experienced a productivity regress of about 0.0205 times the input-output sample mean vector annually. The productivity regress was mainly due to technical regress, which was about 0.0232 times the input-output sample mean vector annually. In addition, the empirical results show that the bank efficiency rankings are quite robust with respect to the sample mean directional vector and the unit directional vector.

Consumption and production externalities and imperfect competition not only break the link between Pareto optimal and competitive equilibria, but also raise the issue of first-best fiscal policies. By considering the endogenously determined number of intermediate firms, we show that agglomeration reinforces economic growth and a consumption externality leads to an inappropriately high economic growth rate under competitive equilibrium. Furthermore, consumption and income taxes lower growth, but a subsidy to intermediate firms' operation costs benefits growth. Finally, we show that the optimal consumption tax is positively related to the size of the consumption externality. An optimal subsidy to offset the fixed cost and the degree of agglomeration is also described. The optimal income tax is to pay a subsidy to labor and capital in order to correct for production inefficiency.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-201009-201010180086-201010180086-387-412,38.3,2010,Taiwan Economic Review

In this paper, a variable returns-to-scale production technology is assumed, and the CM productivity change is decomposed into pure technical efficiency change, technical change, allocative efficiency change, an input-price effect, and cost scale efficiency change. The proposed decomposition is a modification of the Maniadakis and Thanassoulis (2004) approach under the assumption of constant returns to scale technology. Empirical results show that between 1995 and 2003, the industry-wide IM were near 1.0, indicating no improvement in productivity in the banking industry. However, the estimate for CM shows a 5% productivity change, which is mainly due to cost saving reflected by the input-price effect and improvement in scale efficiency. This improvement in productivity in the Taiwanese banking industry would most likely be not identified were the analysis conducted using either the input-oriented (IM) or the output-oriented (OM) Malmquist productivity approach.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200912-201001140012-201001140012-353-378,37.4,2009,Taiwan Economic Review

In particular, due to the risk of non-performing loans faced by the credit department, the directional graph distance function is adopted in our study to provide a risk-adjusted performance measure. It is found that the performance of marketing and credit departments are in general much better than those of the extension and insurance departments.

Labor inputs are divided into ICT labor and non-ICT labor; and capital inputs are divided into automation capital and physical capital. The empirical evidence shows the followings. First, the adjustment speed of quasi-fixed inputs-ICTs and physical capital-are relatively faster in high-technology industries compared to other industries, showing Taiwan's high-technology industries may have performed better in facing environmental shocks. Second, the contribution of ICTs to high-technology industries is more significant than to traditional industries due to wide uses of the ICTs.

In addition, results generally confirm the hypotheses that prior investors in the host country, cost of investment and firm size, as well as possession of technological ability, vertical integration and investment risk, are significantly related to early FDI. The evidence also shows that timing of FDI is affected by exports. Finally we note that the determinants of timing and probability differ for investment in mainland China, South-east Asia, and developed countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200909-200911060075-200911060075-237-267,37.3,2009,Taiwan Economic Review

Besides the general specification of the e-commerce adoption function, we consider the network externality and the endogeneity of e-commerce adoption. We also evaluate the difference in productivity improvement splitting the data into small and medium, and large firms, and high-tech, and traditional firms.

My belief is that the popular wisdom is right in the short-run, but it may be wrong in the long-run. A stricter standard can deter the shirking problem among scholars and improve their research performance (the short-run effect), but it may discourage able youth from entering this professional and result in lower research productivity in the future (the long-run effect).

Optimal Trade Policy with Parallel Imports,"Kuo-Feng Kao, Cheng-Hau Peng","parallel imports, optimal trade policy, uniform pricing, price discrimination","Parallel imports are goods traded outside the control of an original trademark or copyright manufacturer. This paper, utilizing a three-stage three-country model to investigate the retail country's optimal trade policy towards parallel imports. The retail country's optimal trade policy is shown to depend on the pricing scheme employed by the manufacturer. Increasing parallel imports have no impact on the retail country's welfare but decreases world welfare and the profit of the manufacturer if the manufacturer uses a twopart tariff as its pricing scheme. In contrast, if the manufacturer engages in price discrimination, both the retail country's welfare and the profit of the manufacturer increase but the impact on world welfare is ambiguous.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200906-200907140034-200907140034-111-133,37.2,2009,Taiwan Economic Review

The game consists of two stages. In the first stage, the importing country can choose different trade liberalization policies with regard to a tariff-rate quota. These policies include a lower in-quota tariff, a lower over-quota tariff or a higher quota level. In the second stage, there are one foreign firm and one domestic firm competing in Cournot fashion in the home country market. We find that the three trade liberalization policies may generate significantly different effects on the R&D behavior of the foreign (exporting) firm. Lowering the in (over)-quota tariff tends to increase (has no effect on) the R&D level of the foreign exporting firm, but relaxing the quota in contrast may decrease the R&D level.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200906-200907140034-200907140034-135-160,37.2,2009,Taiwan Economic Review

The paper shows that a rise in the export tax creates a horizontaldifferentiation effect to mitigate competition by enlarging the degree of horizontal differentiation. This leads to the result that the optimal export policy of the domestic country is to levy a tax. However the optimal policy is free trade if the two firms act as local monopolists. The optimal policy is to subsidize, if the degree of horizontal differentiation remains unchanged in the short run. Lastly, the paper shows that a rise in the degree of horizontal differentiation raises the optimal rate of subsidy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200906-200907140034-200907140034-161-184,37.2,2009,Taiwan Economic Review
Shifting Comparative Advantage in East Asia: Re-examining the Flying Geese Paradigm,"Hung-Yi Chen, Deng-Shing Huang","Flying Geese Model, Asian Economies, Comparative Advantage","We use the ＜||＞flying geese＜||＞ pattern of development to examine the dynamic changes in comparative advantage in East Asia and the US during 1970 and 2002 by using SITC Rev.2 trade data at the four-digit level. We first argue that the traditional approach of comparing Spearman rank coefficients for pairs of countries' RCA vectors is not only unreliable due to the aggregation bias of data but also sensitive to the presumed lag period from catching up. Alternatively we compare the pattern of the time series of RCA by industry for pairs of countries to identify whether a declining sector in the presumed advanced country, the leading goose, is matched with a rising sector in a catching-up country. The major findings are as follows: First, not all industries follow the flying-geese development pattern in East Asia. Secondly, among those declining industries in Japan and/or the US, NIEs caught up earlier than the ASEAN4. For the NIEs the catching-up industries are mainly composed of the physical capital-intensive manufactures, resource-based manufactures, and human capital-intensive manufactures; while for the ASEAN4 they are mainly primary products, resource-based manufactures, and labor-intensive manufactures. Finally and most importantly, China's lately opening up and its fast-growing features have disturbed the formation of the Asian flying geese.

"Heterogeneous Firms, Monopolistic Competition and Trade Policy","Jollene Z. Wu, Mei-Yu Lee","firm heterogeneity, import restriction equivalence","This paper constructs a two-country intra-industry trade model with heterogeneous firms to analyze the effects of trade policy-tariffs and quotas. It shows that product variety decreases but consumer's utility increases after trade. This result contradicts the conclusion of Krugman (1979), who argues that variety increases after trade. And it is not consistent with the conventional wisdom: more variety leads to a higher utility level. The paper also shows that under an effective constraint, the lower the quota fee, the less the variety. However, regardless of variety, the consumer's utility under a quota regime is equivalent to that under a tariff regime. This finding contrasts sharply with the conclusion of Young and Anderson (1980), who argue that a tariff always generates higher consumer utility than a quota. Under our framework the equivalence of tariffs and quotas holds with respect to aggregate price, consumer's surplus and domestic profit.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200906-200907140034-200907140034-213-234,37.2,2009,Taiwan Economic Review

In this paper, we propose a generalized method of moment (GMM) estimator for a stochastic frontier model to correct the measurement error problem. The estimator differs from the method of moment (MoM) estimator of Chen and Wang (2004) in two important ways: (1) The GMM estimator is proposed for a SF model with a truncated-normal random variable, which is a more flexible and empirically-popular model than the half-normal SF model targeted by the MoM estimator. (2) The GMM estimator uses more moment conditions and is more efficient.

In this paper, we systematically review the empirical research on Taiwan's money demand function over the past 30 years. The discussion focuses on the specification and the stability of the function. From this survey we can see that the money demand function of Taiwan has been investigated intensively in the existing literature, and the results are fruitful. However, the economic and financial environment of Taiwan has been changing rapidly, and transaction patterns and financial products also transforming continuously. How these are going to affect money demand behavior has not been examined thoroughly, and this will be a promising research topic in the future.

Industrial Agglomeration with Urban Congestion Costs,"Shin-Kun Peng, Jyh-Fa Tsai","urban congestion cost, complete dispersion, core-periphery model","This paper incorporates urban congestion costs (an externality) in the production sector of Krugman's model (1991) to examine the impact of congestion costs on the choice of a firm's locations and its effect on industrial agglomeration. We show that the equilibrium regional configuration is dependent on the effects of the agglomeration force as well as the dispersion force, and the dispersion force in this model involves the congestion costs of firms and the transport costs associated with manufacturing goods. We highlight the negative externality of agglomeration in the firm’s production and find that complete dispersion arises when transport cost is low. However, when the transport costs increase and are large enough, the congestion cost effect is insignificant and dominated by the transport costs effect, and the outcome will converge to Krugman's results. This finding confirms Tabuchi's (1998) result by considering land consumption (i.e., congestion costs) in the household sector.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200903-37-1-53-78-a,37.1,2009,Taiwan Economic Review

The revenue and cost resulting from interconnection is distributed through interconnection charges. However, interconnection charges are a kind of transfer payment, which may very well lead to deadweight loss. As such, a ”bill and keep” arrangement is proposed to improve economic efficiency. This study attempts to analyze network formation under a bill-and-keep arrangement. The findings are: the topology of networks under a bill-and-keep arrangement may vary, but can never be a star, circle, or wheel network; and if the interconnection charges are priced at marginal costs, the bill-and-keep arrangement can not be sustainable.

Currency Substitution and the Failures of Nominal Anchor Exchange Rate Policy,"Yu-Fong Sun, Tien-Wang Tsaur","currency substitution, nominal anchor exchange rate policy, exchange-rate-based stabilization program","This paper investigates the relationship between the failures of nominal anchor exchange rate policy and the degree of currency substitution. Following Végh (1995) we set up a transaction-based monetary model with currency substitution in which the foreign and domestic currencies both provides liquidity services to reduce transaction costs. The main reason for failure in enforcing the nominal anchor exchange rate is that the current account does not satisfy the intertemporal balance constraint. In order to delay the currency crisis, the nominal anchor exchange rate policy must have a great regard for the degree of currency substitution. When the degree of currency substitution is high, the monetary authority can greatly reduce the rate of devaluation of domestic currency. On the other hand, when the degree of currency substitution is low, the monetary authority should reduce the rate of devaluation of domestic currency as little as possible.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200812-36-4-427-461-a,36.4,2008,Taiwan Economic Review

There is one foreign firm competing with one domestic firm in the domestic market. We shall examine how an antidumping policy affects the FDI decision of the foreign constrained firm. This goes beyond previous studies by treating the FDI decision (i.e., the location of the foreign firm) as an endogenous and continuous variable which allows us to examine thoroughly the location pattern of the foreign firm. Our main findings are as follows: (i) If the fixed cost of FDI is not high, the foreign firm will definitely engage in FDI when it is subject to an antidumping policy. This result is in support of the empirical finding of Blonigen (2002). (ii) The foreign firm with a higher marginal cost is more likely to engage in FDI, if constrained by an antidumping policy.

To avoid impractical relative indicator weights, we incorporate experts' weights from an AHP survey into the assurance region data envelopment analysis (AR/DEA) for empirical analysis. Empirical results show that, on average, public schools outperform private schools. However, we also find that some private schools perform better than average public schools.

This paper applies Hansen (1999) panel threshold model to examine whether and at what level the stock of research results in different production technology. The interaction effects on productivity of research, research spillovers and human capital proxied by the educational structure of employees are examined for both high-and low-tech electronics firms. Results show that production technologies are significantly different when research stock exceeds the threshold level. Firms with research intensity exceeding 2% are not necessarily high-tech firms.

First, to increase the measure's completeness this paper attempts to subsume a scale efficiency term (SEC) in the MMPI. Second, the 'catch-up' term in the MMPI is further divided into two subcomponents: pure technological catch-up (PTCU) and potential technological relative change (PTRC), to achieve a more meaningful decomposition. An empirical study is then conducted using data on two country groups: 26 high income level countries (DCs) and 40 middle and low income level countries (LDCs) for 1980-2003. The results reveal that: (i) the MMPI shows a higher productivity of LDCs. However, the gMMPI shows a lower productivity of LDCs. Such a reversal suggests the risk of using the MMPI without considering the SEC effects; (ii) when focusing on the Four Asian Tigers, the implication of the PTCU and PTRC are more unambiguous. Finally, this study also inspects the pattern of pure technological catch-up. The results show that a country with a lower level of technology will exhibit a higher catch-up rate.

Do Children Visit Doctors More When the Fee is Lower? Evidence from the Medical Care Subsidy Program in Taipei,"Hsing-Wen Han, Hsien-Ming Lien","medical care subsidy, co-payment, health utilization","In 2002, the Ministry of Interior started the ”Medical Care Subsidy Program for Children under 3” that aims to incrcase children's use of medical care through the co-payment exemption. Although this program is highly praised, its effect on the children's medical use is not clear due to the low co-payment policy of the Taiwan National Health Insurance system. Because a similar program was first implemented in Taipei in 1995, and subsequently expanded to children aged 4-6 in Oct 1998, this expansion provides an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of the co-payment exemption. Using data from the National Health Insurance Data between 1997 and 2000, we investigate the effect of the co-payment exemption on the use of outpatient services by children, aged 4-6 and registered in Taipei. To reduce the selection bias, the ”difference in difference” method is adopted using children of the same age cohort and registered in Taipei County as the comparison group. Our results show that on average the co-payment exemption increases the yearly outpatient use by 1.6 visits or 7.8 percent; the price elasticity is estimated to be approximately -0.08.

Although it is widely thought that infrastructure construction was important to the growth, there has been no empirical study to test the conjecture. In this paper, we present evidences to show that the construction of the trunk railway line and the Keelung and Kaoshiung harbors in the 1900s lowered transportation cost, increased trade opportunities, and brought about an integrated market in Taiwan. Trade opportunities enhanced farmers' incentive to raise productivity. We find that after the modern communication system began to operate, rice productivity increases near the rail stations were higher than in the non-station areas. We also find that land prices near the rail stations increased much more than in the non-station areas. We argue that this is due to the benefit of the economies of agglomeration and the externalities from the lower transportation cost.

Simultaneous Price Adjustments of the Same Scale?-Concerted Actions or Conscious Parallel Conduct,"Hsien-Ming Lien, Ji-Tian Sheu","concerned actions, facilitating conducts, conscious parallel conducts, gas markets","In Oct, 2004, after 20 ”simultaneous price adjustments of the same scale” of the suggested retail price (SRP), the Fair Trade Committee (FTC) found that the Chinese Petroleum Company (CPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Company (FPCC) had violated the provision against ”concerted action” because these two refineries communicated price information through the media. This paper attempts to use survey data of downstream gas stations to examine whether ”simultaneous price adjustments of the same scale” of the SRP, as implied by the FTC's indictment, actually result in the identical factory invoice price (FIP). Although obtaining FIP is difficult, the majority of gas stations in Taiwan provide sales discounts, either cash rebates or gifts. Because the discount is due to the difference between FIP and SRP, it can be used as a proxy for FIP conditional on the same SRP. After controlling for a gas station’s location and ownership, nearby gas demand, and local competition, our results show that the discount is larger for stations selling FPCC gas, indicating unequal FIP between the two refineries. This result holds after accounting for the fact that stations endogenously select upstream suppliers. Our finding is inconsistent with the statements in the FTC indictment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200809-36-3-393-421-a,36.3,2008,Taiwan Economic Review

Taiwan's hightechnology industries indeed show better performance and higher productivity than the traditional industries in that the high-technology industries reflect more advanced technology and relatively faster adjustment speeds when facing environmental shocks. The high-technology clustering effects derive from the positive impact of the associated spillover effects, learning effects, and the high-technology vertical disintegration system.

This paper discusses the effects of the unemployment benefits on the unemployment duration. A discrete-time hazard model is applied to the survey data of the ”Tracing Survey on the Employment of Unemployed Labor.” In addition to personal characteristics and time-varying business cycle indicators, in the regression we measure the effects of unemployment benefits on search intensities from several dimensions. The empirical results show that the unemployed have a higher reemployment rate during the periods when they receive benefits. This suggests that the unemployed increase their search intensities in response to more resources. The increase in the reemployment rate, though, diminishes with an increase in unemployment duration. Furthermore, when the replacement ratio is raised and resources are increased, it helps the unemployed workers to search for and find jobs. However, the reemployment hazard does not increase as the individuals get closer to the time when the benefits lapse, though new job acceptances increase around the time of the benefits exhaustion.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200806-36-2-235-270-a,36.2,2008,Taiwan Economic Review

Data from the CVDFACTS project and NHI are used for the empirical analysis. Results using the quadratics model show that if we can ameliorate risk factors, such as hypertension, cholesterol and diabetes, among serious cardiovascular disease sufferers so that the risk levels are no higher than found in the general population the cost of medical service can be reduced NT$1,070, 423 and 418 million respectively. Using the log-linear model, results are NT$1,570, 508 and 1,130 respectively. Compared to cholesterol and diabetes, hypertension is relatively easy to ameliorate and the benefit is higher. In order to effectively prevent serious cardiovascular disease, the government needs to shift medical resources towards improving hypertension.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200803-36-1-1-37-a,36.1,2008,Taiwan Economic Review
"Aggregate Shocks, Financial Intermediaries, and Risk Sharing","Yeong-Yuh Chiang, You-Ching Yeh","aggregate shocks, financial intermediation, financial market, financial regulation","This paper provides an overlapping generations model to investigate the role of decentralized intermediaries in buffering aggregate shocks. Such buffering mechanisms are implemented through cross-generational risk sharing and profit accumulation. Market power, potential profits, and contractual arrangements are vital to profit-driven financial intermediaries to provide participants insurance against aggregate shocks. In market equilibrium, aggregate shocks cause the value of the agent’s wealth to fluctuate. Our intermediated contracts alleviate this adverse effect and are complementary to financial market transactions. Although there exists efficiency gains from our decentralized intermediation, the gains are not as great as what Allen and Gale (1997)'s centralized bank achieves. In view of financial regulatory policy, adequate market power is required to induce intermediaries to provide the Pareto superior financial contracts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200803-36-1-39-66-a,36.1,2008,Taiwan Economic Review
Beauty Premiums in Politics-The Case of the 2004 Legislator Elections in Taiwan,"Cheng-Da Li, Ming-Ching Luoh","beauty premium, election, politics","Using data from the 2004 legislator elections, this paper studies the effect of beauty on election outcomes. First, based on photos scanned from the election bulletin, the beauty of 386 candidates is rated by 16 judges. Second, after taking out the influence of judge's personal characteristics, beauty scores are formed. The analyses of beauty scores show that the beauty scores of female candidates are higher than the male candidates on average and the gender differences in beauty scores diminish with age. The average beauty scores decrease with age for both men and women, while the variation within the same sex also decreases with age. It is shown that the beauty scores becomes higher as the level of education increases, and candidates from the four major parties score higher than all the other candidates. As for the beauty premium, it is found that moving up 1 standard deviation on the beauty scale will increase one's votes by 20.5%. Furthermore, for candidates from the 4 major parties, the coefficient of beauty is not significant and the vote-splitting strategy reduces the effect of beauty. For independent candidates and candidates from other parties, the beauty premium does exist and its size is so great that moving up 1 standard deviation on the beauty scale will increase the votes gathered by 50%. It is also shown that the beauty premium for independent candidates and candidates from other parties is higher in more urbanized electoral districts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200803-36-1-67-113-a,36.1,2008,Taiwan Economic Review
How to Use National Health Insurance Data to Conduct Health Economics Research,Hsien-Ming Lien,"Taiwan national health insurance data, Health research data, Universal health insurance","Since the inception of National Health Insurance in 1995, Taiwan has accumulated a decade of National Health Insurance Data (NHID). This data can assist the health authority to learn to help control the rising health spending. From a researcher's perspective, this paper discusses advantages and disadvantages, possibilities and restrictions, as well as principles and skills for using NHID. I first show the strength and weakness of NHID by comparing NHID with other important health data sets in Taiwan. Because NHID consists of many data files, I regroup these files into three sub-databases based on each file's specific role: expenditures, medical orders, and basic characteristics of patients, providers and physicians. Then I describe the rules concerning how to analyze each sub-database, how to merge files from two different sub-databases, and how to connect NHID with other non-health data.

The Impact of Adolescents' Drug Abuse on Sexual Activities,"Wei-Der Tsai, Yu-Sheng Liu","adolescents, sexual activities, risk sexual behavior and drug abuse","With Taiwan's society becoming increasingly open, there is a dramatic increase in the prevalence of sexual activity and drug abuse among adolescents. These are looming hazards threatening the youth's health and leading to social problems in Taiwan. Empirical evidence obtained in previous studies suggests the existence of an association between drug abuse and sexual activity for adolescents in western societies. However, a consensus has not been reached regarding the nature of this association. Some scholars suggest that the association arises from unobserved factors, which simultaneously affect both behaviors, and after controlling for these unobservable factors the association may disappear. This research uses data from The 2000 Study Survey of School Students' Sexual Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behavior in Taiwan to study the relationship between adolescent sexual activity and drug abuse. Our empirical analysis employs a simultaneous equation probit model, which takes into account the existence of unobservable factors affecting both behaviors. Our empirical results shows a positive causal effect of drug abuse on both the likelihood of engaging in sexual activity and of engaging in unsafe sex (i.e., unprotected sex or sex with multiple partners). This finding suggests that the government's anti-drug policies may have the beneficial side-effect of decreasing adolescend sex and unsafe sex.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200712-35-4-379-413-a,35.4,2007,Taiwan Economic Review
Physician Induced Demand and Hemodialysis Treatment in Taiwan,"Ji-Tian Sheu, Hsien-Ming Lien","supplier induced demand, dialysis treatment, ownership","The ”supplier-induced demand (SID)” hypothesis states that health suppliers, in the face of negative income shocks, may exploit their agency relationships with patients by providing excessive care. We argue SID leads providers to compensate for their losses by substituting away from drug treatment toward more heavily reimbursed dialysis treatment for chronic renal failure (CRF) patients. We test this hypothesis by examining whether a provider's earlier loss increases the volume of dialysis treatment for new CRF patients during the current period. Using Taiwan National Health Insurance Data between 1996 and 2001, we found this negative correlation after controlling for unobserved characteristics of providers (e.g., reputation) using a ”first difference” approach. On average, a provider would compensate for 5-10% of their losses with new dialysis treatment. These results holds for bofh clinics and physicians and for periods of 3, 6, or 12 months.

This paper examines the causes and consequences of this price gap. Our results indicate that the pharmaceutical price gap is rooted in a system in which (1) physicians are allowed to both prescribe and dispense drugs; and (2) hospitals operate with large outpatient departments and possess significant market power on the demand side of the pharmaceutical wholesale market. The existence of the pharmaceutical price gap creates three distortions in relative prices in the health sector, which in turn lead to efficiency loss in resource allocation. The long run solution for the pharmaceutical price gap is to separate the pharmaceutical prescribing and dispensing. In the short run, the effective policy reform would be to mitigate the price distortion in the health care market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200712-35-4-451-476-a,35.4,2007,Taiwan Economic Review

We show that borrowers in countries with less-developed financial sectors may choose to be self-financed so that an increase in the tax rate may not exacerbate the problem of asymmetric information. Since financial sectors are less developed in less-developed countries than in developed ones, our result implies that the optimal tax rate should be larger in less-developed countries than that in developed ones.

Then, by using the estimated wage function, the impact of job tenure, work experience, job match, and job switching on wage dynamics are calculated separately. We find that, for all workers, job tenure accounts for 65.8% of wage changes, job switching for 26.5%, and work experience for 10.6%. To our surprise, the degree of job match has a slightly negative impact on wage changes, namely, -3.1%.

To fill the gap, this note incorporates the corporate tax into de Meza's model. The three main findings are as follows. First, the optimal export policy will make the ”effective export subsidy rate” equal to de meza's optimal export subsidy rate; thus, the traditional result of ”a high subsidy rate with low costs,” should be restated as ”a high effective subsidy rate with low costs.” Secondly, the traditional result stated above may not be sustained, when two firms' effective marginal costs greatly differ from each other due to their countries' corporate tax policies. Moreover, even when the corporate tax policies of two countries are the same, the traditional de Meza result may not be correct. Finally, if either the corporate tax policy makes the effective marginal costs of the two firms almost equal, or the tax corrective effect of the low-cost country is larger than that of the high-cost country, the traditional de Meza result will still hold.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200709-35-3-321-335-a,35.3,2007,Taiwan Economic Review

Our main conclusions are as follows. First, in comparison with the situation of independent ownership, the system products' price is lower when there is composite good competition and higher when there is parallel horizontal integration, but the system price differential between the cases of independent ownership and parallel vertical integration (or joint ownership) is ambiguous. The system price differential between the independent ownership case and these two kinds of integration types depends on horizontal substitution among complementary products. Second, the social welfare when there is composite good competition or joint ownership is closest to the maximum, followed by the case of parallel vertical integration. Independent ownership and parallel horizontal integration are the two most difficult cases under which to achieve social welfare maximization.

It is shown that given a linear demand, the optimal policy is to impose a tax (subsidy) if the government has a high affinity for social welfare (campaign contributions). Moreover, the tariff difference is influenced by two factors: the government's valuation of social welfare relative to contributions, and the cost difference among the firms. Furthermore, when the government cares more for social welfare, the tariff will be higher (lower) for the firm with lower (higher) average cost. In contrast, if the government places a high weight on campaign contributions, the optimal import policy is to subsidize imports and firms with lower (higher) average cost will be given a higher (lower) subsidy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200706-35-2-155-182-a,35.2,2007,Taiwan Economic Review

According to Montgomery (1972), differences in the distribution of initial allowances affects only the income distribution, but not resource allocation. However, we find that changes in distribution of initial allowances are no longer allocational-neutral, provided that the influence of interest groups are present and the interest groups have different lobbying efficiency. We also compare the political equilibrium amount of emission allowances with the socially optimal level, and find that the former may be more stringent than the latter. The impact of changing the distribution of initial allowances on social welfare is another major concern. Suppose the established polluting sources own all of the initial allowances. We find that granting a certain proportion of initial allowances to the new polluting sources gives rise to an ambiguous effect on social welfare, which depends on the relative lobbying efficiency of interest groups.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200609-34-3-261-284-a,34.3,2006,Taiwan Economic Review

Empirical results indicate that market comparisons are the main drivers of the changes in executive pay. There are adjustments towards the market rate for both underpaid and overpaid executives. Those executives that have been underpaid (overpaid) are likely to have their pay significantly increased (reduced) in the subsequent period. Meanwhile, the estimated adjustment factor by which the pay moves toward the market rate for underpaid executives is greater than that for overpaid executives.

Moreover, the empirical analysis of the labor supply behavior for Taiwanese women from 1979 to 2001 suggests that the estimation results are more sensitive to the choice of the econometric method than the difference in data sets. It is also found that the potential multicollinearity problem of using the proxy work experience variable is non-negligible. We conclude this analysis by pointing out that the non-parametric estimation approach and the application of the average treatment effect to study the policy effect are two worthwhile directions for future research on female labor supply.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200606-34-2-119-172-a,34.2,2006,Taiwan Economic Review
New Keynesian Phillips Curve and Capital Mobility-Theory and Empirics,"Lii-Tarn Chen, Jong-Rong Chen, Ren-Kuang Lue","new keynesian, small open economy, new phillips curve, degree of capital mobility","The magnitude of the slope of the Phillips curve is a crucial index for the effectiveness of monetary policies. With a flatter slope, the authority can increase inflation less in order to reduce the economy's unemployment rate. Thus, identifying determinants of the output (or unemployment)-inflation tradeoff has an important policy implication. In this paper, to establish a microfoundation for the conventional model, we analysis the relationship between capital mobility and the Phillips curve, while using a small open economy based on a New Keynesian framework. We show that with greater restrictions on capital mobility, a given reduction in the inflation rate is associated with a smaller loss in output, when applied to Taiwan's time series data. This result is shown to be consistent with predictions concerning Taiwan's macroeconomic situation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200606-34-2-173-208-a,34.2,2006,Taiwan Economic Review
The Impact of Choice Set Definition on Random Utility Models: Taiwanese Coastal Wetland Valuation as an Example,"Wei-Chun Tseng, Juin-Yie Huang","random utility models, choice set, conditional logit model, mixed logit model","This paper discusses alternative criteria for defining the choice set in the analysis of recreational site choice decisions. Four definitions are considered: 1) all available sites compiled by the researcher, 2) sites known by individuals, 3) sites previously visited by individuals, and 4) sites grouped by distance from individual residence. A survey of randomly sampled visitors was conducted at 19 wetland sites in Taiwan. The recreational trip choices to 19 wetland sites are analyzed using the conditional logit (CL) and mixed logit (MXL) models under each of the four choice set definitions. The estimation results show that regardless of choice model, both parameter estimates and welfare measures are significantly affected by the definition of choice sets and in general a smaller measure of welfare results from a larger choice set. Despite the relaxation of the independence of irrelevant alternative (I.I.A.) hypothesis and individual specific parameter estimates, the flexible mixed logit model does not alleviate the impact of choice set definition on welfare measures.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200606-34-2-209-243-a,34.2,2006,Taiwan Economic Review
The Optimal Government Shareholdings in Public Enterprises in the Process of Privatization,"Jiunn-Rong Chiou, Hong Hwang","public enterprise, privatization, optimal shareholdings","Governments usually hold stock in public enterprises that are in the process of privatization in order to preserve control when the government needs to intervene. The aim of this paper is to find the socially optimal government stock shares in the privatization process. We consider a market with a public enterprise and many domestic and foreign private firms. The marginal cost of firms is assumed to be constant. The main findings are as follows. Privatization is needed only when the production of the public enterprise is less efficient than that of private firms. This is in contrast to the findings of De Fraja (1991) and Matsumura (1998) that the public enterprise should privatize even when firms have identical cost structures. The government should reduce its stock holding in the public enterprise when the number of domestic private firms increases. However, if the number of domestic private firms is sufficiently large, the government should raise its stake in the public enterprise when the number of foreign private firms increases. Furthermore, with free entry and exit for domestic firms, the number of domestic private firms will increase as the degree of privatization increases.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200606-34-2-245-259-a,34.2,2006,Taiwan Economic Review

We show that the optimality of the quality-related R&D subsidy depends on the taste distribution among domestic consumers: the government should subsidize (tax) the high-quality domestic firm's quality-related R&D activity if the variance of this distribution is small (large). However, this subsidy has no effect on the quality choice of the domestic firm if the home firm decides to be a low-quality firm. We also show that the domestic government can grant the quality-related R&D subsidy to induce the domestic firm to raise its product quality and to leapfrog the rival imports if the exogenous quality level of the imports is not high.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200603-34-1-1-26-a,34.1,2006,Taiwan Economic Review
Welfare Analysis of Privatization with Nash Bargaining,"Lily Jiang, Chia-Yu Hsiao","privatization, Nash bargaining, income redistribution","This paper proposes a privatization model with Nash bargaining to analyze the determination of privatization and its distributional effects. We find that the optimal degree of privatization hinges on the post-privatization employment. The result of welfare analysis reveals that privatization is beneficial to both consumers and the stockholders of the privatized firm, if the employment is unchanged after privatization. However, if the employment is reduced through negotiation, consumer surplus will decrease, while the profit of the privatized firm will increase. The increment of profit in the latter circumstance depends on the labor union's care to laid-off employees. The net impact of privatization on employee depends on the effect on workers' productivity, the rent effect and government's threatening effect in the process of negotiation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200603-34-1-27-51-a,34.1,2006,Taiwan Economic Review
The Impact of Conviviality on Profit and Employment in the Taiwanese Service Industry,"Yih-Luan Chyi, Chun-Hsin Hwang","service industry, innovation, conviviality, knowledge","This paper emphasizes that innovation in the service industry comes from using knowledge as well as conviviality. Applying an econometric model, we employ cross sectional data for 3-digit Taiwanese service industries in 2001 to measure conviviality. The indicator of conviviality allows us to assess the relationship between conviviality and changes in profit and employment in Taiwanese service industries from 1996 to 2001. This paper finds that conviviality has a positive association with employment change in Taiwanese consumption-based service industries. We classify consumption-based service industries into three groups according to the distance between customers and service providers. There is a salient correlation between conviviality and the change in the number of firms in the short-distant group. These empirical findings confirm predictions of the theoretical model of conviviality provided in this paper.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200603-34-1-53-77-a,34.1,2006,Taiwan Economic Review

Data from ”Manpower Survey” show that the probabilities of getting married for both men with low education and women with higher education is decreasing as the educational gap shrinks. Hypogamy in educational attainment indeed exists in the marriage market. Furthermore, using individual data from 2000 Census, multinomial logit regressions show that the increase of men's average years of schooling will reduce the probability of marrying both foreign brides and foreign grooms. Finally, compare to their counterparts in domestic marriages, men marrying foreign birdes are less educated while women marrying foreign grooms are better educated. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the decrease of geneder gap in educational attainment leads to the phenomenon of international marriages.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200603-34-1-79-115-a,34.1,2006,Taiwan Economic Review
Establishing a Chinese Economic Cooperative Mechanism: Taiwan's Only Chance to Prevent Economic Marginalization?,Kuo-Chun Yeh,"marginalization, Chinese Economic Area CEA, dynamic game","In Taiwan, economic marginalization has been a main concern due to imbalanced cross-strait economic and political relations, the country's failure to participate in important international organizations, and the endorsement of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) between Hong Kong and China in 2003. Is a regional cooperative mechanism, such as CEPA and its further extensions, the best choice for Taiwan's future economic development? This paper analyzes some options and their possible outcomes based on the current economic relationship among China, Taiwan, and the United States, and the principles of macroeconomic and international economic stabilization. The results are: (1) Taiwan does best by participating in regional cooperative mechanisms, putting aside the independence issue; (2) Taiwan keeps its independent political status and economic policy.

Optimal Quality Policy for Exports,"Fang-Yueh Chen, Tsai-Chen Shen","endogenous quality, optimal export quality control","We explore the welfare implications of export quality policy in which trading countries decide sequentially or negotiate over their policy on standards. We prove that in price (quantity) competition, the country producing high quality should set a quality ceiling (minimum standard) on exports. We also show that if exporting countries alone negotiate the standard, then in price competition the optimal policy is to put a minimum standard (quality ceiling) on high-quality (low-quality) exports. In quantity competition, the optimal policy is to impose a quality ceiling on all kinds of exports. We further prove that the case in which only exporting countries negotiate gives the high-quality country the highest welfare among alternatives. Finally, we find that in price competition, collective negotiation among all trading countries is the best mode of policy-making for global welfare; but in quantity competition, the importing countries' global welfare reaches its optimum when the high-quality country acts as the policy-making leader.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200512-33-4-263-294-a,33.4,2005,Taiwan Economic Review

The key feature of business cycles is the co-movement among individual economic variables. Based on this definition, it is not suitable to select a single variable, such as real GDP, to measure business cycles. Hence, which variables should be chosen to measure business cycles is an important topic. In this paper we use diffusion indexes developed by Stock and Watson (1998, 2002) and Bai and Ng (2002) to estimate common factors. Comparing the R^2 of the regressions of individual time series against the estimated factors, we can select representative variables to construct new reference cycles using the composite index method developed by the Council for Economic Planning and Development.

Will the New-style Currency Decrease Counterfeiting?-The Effect of Withdrawal Policy,"Ying-Syuan Li, Yi-Ting Li","new-style currency, counterfeit, withdrawal of old-style currency, search model","A common policy to decrease counterfeiting is to introduce new-style currency that is harder and more expensive to counterfeit. Upon introducing new-style currency, government may withdraw old-style currency from circulation with or without imposing a deadline for private holders to exchange old-style money for new-style. The withdrawal policy affects the length of time it takes for the removal of old-style currency to be completed and, thus, have impacts on the effectiveness of decreasing counterfeiting. We use a random matching model to study the effect on stopping counterfeiting of different withdrawal policies accompanying the issue of new-style currency. We find that, if the enforcement effort against counterfeiting is not high enough, the introduction of new-style currency will not achieve a steady state where counterfeiting is eliminated. If government withdraws old-style currency more aggressively, it takes a shorter time to eliminate counterfeiting. However, seeing the counterfeit money start to decrease, government should not make a premature judgment that the policy of eliminating counterfeiting has achieved its purpose. If government wrongly makes the judgment and decreases its effort in confiscating counterfeit money as well as withdrawing old-style currency, the counterfeiting problem may resume.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200509-33-3-229-255-a,33.3,2005,Taiwan Economic Review

Furthermore, although unemployment insurance tends to decrease the reemployment probability in bad times, it does have a positive effect on the reemployment probability when the economy expands.

A Note on Testing the Induced Innovation Hypothesis under Dynamic Adjustment,Yir-Hueih Luh,"resource endowments, induced innovation, dynamic adjustment","This note proposes an empirical test of the induced innovation hypothesis tinder a dynamic adjustment framework. The dynamic dual approach is employed to derive the system of behavioral equations and dynamic analogue to Hayami and Ruttan's definition of factor-using bias. Empirical implementation of the proposed methodology is demonstrated by examining the plausibility of the induced innovation hypothesis against the development experience of Taiwan's agricultural production. Based on the econometrically estimated parameters, the induced factor-using bias for each input are calculated and graphed against its relative prices. The results suggest that technical change was biased in the labor-saving and material-using direction during the period 1952 to 1987, in response to the continuous increase in the labor wage rate and the decline in material prices relative to other input prices. However, technical change in Taiwan's agricultural production was almost neutral with respect to the of capital for the entire period, which was a period revealing relative stability in capital prices.

We use a model to illustrate that whether the increase in educational opportunity will enhance or lessen the effect of family background depends on the initial enrollment rate. When the initial enrollment rate is low, for example, the increase in the enrollment rate will make the effect of family background stronger. Empirical results from the 1978-2001 surveys are consistent with the model's predictions. The expansion of college enrollment rate increases the effect of family background on the probability of entering college. Specifically, children of teachers are more likely to get a college education by 11.75% in 1997-2001. Given that the probability of obtaining college education is positively correlated with family background, the so-called ”low tuition” policy for public college are in fact a reverse income redistribution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200412-32-4-417-445-a,32.4,2004,Taiwan Economic Review

This implies that the Stackelberg leader output levels can be achieved by optimal competition policy. However, in the case of increasing marginal costs (and at least linear demand), a stricter competition policy should be adopted to increase the number of domestic firms, unless the marginal costs of domestic firms are increasing more slowly than that of foreign firms. With Bertrand competition, a stricter competition policy should be used as (i) the number of foreign firms increase, or (ii) the degree of product heterogeneity increases.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200409-32-3-321-345-a,32.3,2004,Taiwan Economic Review
Strategic Trade Policies Revisited: A Political Economy Approach,Chelsea C. Lin,"lobbying, strategic trade policy, imperfect competition","This paper applies the Grossman and Helpman (1994) menu-auction model to investigate the formation of strategic export subsidies and strategic import tariffs (or subsidies). The results of this paper indicate that even with political pressure, a Grossman-Helpman politically-determined export subsidy is identical to a Brander-Spencer rent-shifting export subsidy. When the optimal import policy is a tariff, the politically-determined import tariff will be higher than the optimal level; when the optimal import policy is a subsidy, the politically-determined import subsidy will be lower than the optimal level or became an import tariff. The above-mentioned results are different in the presence of class bias. This paper highlights the possibility that lobbying can restore the level of trade intervention to a more efficient one in the absence of a benevolent dictator.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200409-32-3-347-367-a,32.3,2004,Taiwan Economic Review
A Cohort Analysis on Earnings Mobility and Life-Time Inequality,P. C. Roger Cheng,"earnings mobility, lifetime inequality, cohort effect","Mobility is as important as equality to the subject of economic fairness. To gauge the inequality of living standards in a society, the distribution of lifetime incomes should be more relevant than that of single-period incomes. However, most empirical studies in Taiwan have focused on the latter because of the lack of longterm panel data. This paper uses matched cross sections from the 1978–2002 Manpower Utilization Surveys (MUS) to construct an index of mobility using the correlation coefficient, and follows Deaton and Paxson (1994b) to decompose patterns of short-term earnings mobility for male employees into cohort, age, and year effects. Empirical results show that (1) mobility has become lower among younger cohorts, (2) mobility decreases with age, and (3) mobility exhibits procyclicality property. Also, this paper estimates inequality of earnings summed over 10 years, and concludes that the distribution of lifetime incomes turns out to be more unequal among younger cohorts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200409-32-3-369-393-a,32.3,2004,Taiwan Economic Review

(2000) to dual floating exchange rate regimes to incorporate the wealth effect. For a country adopting a dual floating exchange rate system, international monetary shocks will cause the price level to increase persistently. If the price level reaches the price ceil ing threshold, then the monetary authority will adopt a deflationary policy. We explore how these shocks will affect the possible adjustment paths of relevant macroeconomic variables. The major findings are as follows. The liquidity effect, foreign interest revenue effect and interest rate income effect which are all caused by change in the nominal money supply are the key factors affecting the possible adjustment paths of relevant macroeconomic variables. Moreover, whether the price regime will collapse or not and the timing of the monetary author ity's adjustment of the nominal money supply are dependent on the price ceiling threshold. The stronger the desire of the monetary authority to defend the price ceiling threshold, the earlier the monetary authority will adopt the monetary policy to attack inflation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200406-32-2-145-192-a,32.2,2004,Taiwan Economic Review
Long Memory and Regime Switch,"Jiun-Kuei Hsieh, Jeff Chien-Fu Lin","FIGARCH model, markov-switching model, SWARCH model, SW(k)-FIGARCH-L model, long memory","The strong persistence in volatility of a variety of financial time series is well known. To determine whether this persistence can be characterized as ”long memory” is important in both financial and econometric modelling. In this pa per, after summarizing Hamilton and Susmel's (1994) regime switching SWARCH model and BBM's (1996) long memory FIGARCH for volatility; we propose a general SW(k)-FIGARCH-L(0,d,0) model that allows the estimation of both regime switching parameters and the long memory parameter. In such a frame work we are able to test whether the volatility still has long memory after regime switching has been considered and we show that regime switching in volatility can result in spurious long memory. Furthermore, we find the proposed model also solves one of the problems with the standard SWARCH model that squared residuals obtained from the SWARCH model estimation usually are highly correlated, which implies the simple regime switching mechanism is not able to characterize all the dynamics in volatility. Based on these encouraging results, we believe the proposed model is a promising tool in analyzing financial data. Our empirical analysis of the TAIEX data shows that the long memory in their volatility will reduce to intermediate memory after regime switching is considered, which represents an interesting example of spurious long memory in volatility that is caused by the regime switching.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200406-32-2-193-232-a,32.2,2004,Taiwan Economic Review
Educational Expansion and Wage Inequality: A Cohort Analysis of Full-Time Male Employees in Taiwan,Roger P. C. Cheng,"educational expansion, wage inequality, cohort effect","Education is one of the most decisive determinants of wage income, and the expansion of educational attainment thus should affect wage inequality Because of the lack of a dynamic framework for empirical analysis, there is no consensus so far about the direction of this effect in Taiwan. In contrast to previous studies of income inequality using cross-sectional data, this paper constructs pseudo panel data for full-time male employees from the 1978 to 2001 Manpower Utilization Surveys (TGBAS), and then integrates this with the analytical frameworks pro— vided in Deaton and Paxson (1994) and Fei et al. (1979). Then it decomposes both wage and schooling inequality into age effect, cohort effect, and year effect. Results show that, though schooling inequality is declining for younger cohorts, life-cycle profiles of wage inequality are not significantly different across most cohorts. This fact is mainly explained by the increase in the rate of return to schooling which exactly offsets the effect of decreasing schooling inequality",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200406-32-2-233-266-a,32.2,2004,Taiwan Economic Review

The paper adopts the Chay and Lee (2000) error component model approach, and estimates the unobserved ability premium by allowing un observed productivity to be the permanent component, in which estimation of changes in the return to unobserved ability is based on variation in within-group log-wage variances across groups and over time. The model estimates suggest that 11-30% decrease in the unobserved ability premium for male and 5-11% for female during the 1990s. The evidences also imply that the decrease in the return to ability can account for at most 10.0-31.3% of the observed decrease in the college premium for males, and 5.0-14.3% for females. In addition, the finding that the well-educated male experienced more decline in returns to ability relative to the female reduces the sex-related wage differentials.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200406-32-2-267-291-a,32.2,2004,Taiwan Economic Review

Transition to Self-employment in Taiwan - A Test of the Recession-push Hypothesis,Ruoh-Rong Yu,"self-employed, recession - push effect, prosperity - pull effect","The purpose of this paper is to analyze the decision to enter self-employment by male employees. The hypothesis of a ”recession - push” effect is also examined. The data sets come from the Manpower Utilization Surveys (MUS) conducted by DGBAS in 1978-2002. By pooling the matched sample for the adjacent years, the decision of transition into self-employment is analyzed. Furthermore, the original job status of those in the sample is treated as endogenous in the econometric setting. The results show that an increase in the unemployment rate pushes employed individuals toward self-employment, which support the ”recession - push” hypothesis. However, the empirical results in the earlier then years and the later ten years show different patterns. In 1978-1989, the increases in unemployment rates have positive effects on the transition to self-employment.

Secondly, the amount of inputs used per chia of land in ponlai production were more than that of chailai, especially the amount of fertilizers. Thirdly, this fertilizer intensive technology was diffused to the production of chailai by the 1930s. As for output and profit, we also have several findings. (1) Although greater factor inputs enabled a greated ponlai harvest per chia of land, the harvest was smaller per yen of factor inputs. (2) However, the much higher. (3)while the advantage in price was maintained, ponlai's disadvantage in production cost disappeared gradually in the 1930s.

Re-examining the Sources of Real Exchange Rate Fluctuations: A Rational Expectations Structural VAR Approach,"Hsiu-Yun Lee, Kenneth S.

An exogenous shock not only has effects on real exchange rates directly, but also has indirect effects through the change in predictions for other fundamental variables. The RE-SVAR method imposes all these direct and indirect channels to decompose the sources of real exchange rate fluctuations. We find that the over-identifying restrictions implied by our model cannot be rejected for Canada, France, Italy, and Japan. Our results also indicate that private expenditure shocks are the most important source of real exchange rate variations for France and Italy, monetary shocks are most important for Canada, and foreign price shocks are most important in the long run for Japan. Moreover, supply shocks have a small but significant explanatory power fot real exchange rate variations only in France.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10185833-200312-31-4-439-462-a,31.4,2003,Taiwan Economic Review

This is the motivation for re-analyzing the relationship between real exchange rates and real interest differentials (RERI) by allowing for infinite variance processes. Quarterly observations are used for Canada, France, Germany, Japan, UK and US over the recent floating-rate period. We find sufficient evidence of heavy-tails in our data. Accordingly, we re-form residual-based and likelihood-ratio-based cointegration tests using the critical values adjusted for infinite-variance innovations. Our results obtained by the residual-based cointegration tests demonstrate the rejection of RERI link in all cases either under the assumption of Gaussian or α-stable innovations.

The government subsidy to the NHI was allocated to each household based on two sets of tax incidence assumptions. This study first used total household income to rank households' economic well-being and derive an income inequality index. The study also conducted sensitivity analyses on robustness of the income distribution and income inequality index using both adjusted household size and adult equivalent household income.

However, in experiments with two sequences of ten trials, Partners still contribute more than Strangers even if the histories of individual contributions are known.

Relative price is, however, not significant. In addition, migrants usually overreact when economic factors change, and then readjust their migration behavior toward the equilibrium. Furthermore, Taiwan migrants are risk averse. We also find that structural change is more important than wage change on internal migration. To balance regional population, it is more efficient for the government to restructure the local industrial sectors than to reduce regional income taxes. Finally, any exogenous change in these economic variables would lead to convergent internal migration.

Firm Turnover and Productivity Growth: Evidence from the Taiwanese Manufacturing Sector,Pei-Chou Lin,"Firm Turnover, Resources Reallocation, Total Factor Productivity TFP","Using comprehensive firm-level panel data from the Taiwanese Census of Manufactures for 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1996, we measure total factor productivity for entering, exiting and continuing cohorts of firms and quantify the contribution of firm turnover to industry productivity growth. The main findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, in line with existing studies on other countries, firm turnover reflects underlying productivity differentials in Taiwanese manufacturing. In general, cohorts of new entering firms have lower average productivity than incumbents, but have higher productivity than exiting firms. Besides, with the ”shadow of death effect” as well as selection and learning effects all present, the productivity differential between entering and exiting firms is an important source of industry-level productivity growth in Taiwanese manufacturing. In percentage terms, the effect of entry and exit accounts for more than 65 per cent of Taiwanese Manufacturing average productivity growth during the 1981-1986 period. However, we also find that the effect of entry and exit has been diminishing in recent periods. It accounts for only 11 percent and 15 percent of manufacturing average productivity growth during the 1986-1991 and 1991-1996 period, respectively. The sharp fall in the manufacturing firm turnover rate and the narrowing of the productivity differential between entering and exiting firms are the two main causes of the diminished effect of entry and exit.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200306-31-2-279-319-a,31.2,2003,Taiwan Economic Review

The consumption and portfolio choices are derived from intertemporal optimization. In contrast to Fleming, (1962), Mundell (1963) and Dornbusch (1976), the nominal exchange rate in this paper is determined by the money market rather than the foreign exchange market. A decrease in the foreign interest rate will lead to lower long-run foreign bond holdings, consumption and real money demand. As a result, the long-run nominal exchange rate increases, i.e. domestic currency depreciates. However, short-run consumption will depend on the elasticity of the marginal utility of consumption. The short-run nominal exchange rate depends on both the elasticities of the marginal utility of consumption and real money balances. In a two-sector model with a traded and nontraded good, the elasticities of both good's supply also play an important role in determining consumption and the nominal exchange rate.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200203-31-1-27-50-a,31.1,2003,Taiwan Economic Review
How to Measure Human Capital: Theory and Empirical Evidence from Taiwan,"Yih-Chyi Chuang, Chun-Yuan Lee","human capital, effective labor, job-match, unobservable human quality","Human capital plays a cricital role in a country's economic development. However, unlike physical capital, human capital is usually embodied in the human body and can be cultivated through many different investment channels. This paper develops a measure of human capital based on the idea that investment in human capital should be reflected in a person's wage. We decompose wages into factors related to different forms of human capital and non-human capital and estimate the wage of a base worker, a worker with zero skill. We then use the predicted human capital wage relative to the wage of the base worker to construct an index for the human capital of the whole economy. Using 1979-1988 data from the Taiwan Manpower Utilization Survey, we compare the results of our human capital index with other human capital indices proposed in the recent literature. Based on growth accounting and aggregate production function estimates, our human capital index outperforms other human capital indices.

The Ethnic Bias in Recruitment Examinations for the Civil Service in Taiwan,Ming-Ching Luoh,"Recruitment Examinations, Government Employee, Ethnic Groups","This paper studies the effect of recruitment examinations for the civil service on, the concentration of Mainlanders in the public sector, and tests the ethnic selection bias by comparing the wages of Mainlander and Taiwanese government employees. First, in the Senior Examinations (Gao-Kao) and Junior Examinations (Pu-Kao) held between 1950 and 1961, selection was based on a provincial quota which made it easier for Mainlanders to pass the examinations and become government employees. Second, the Special Examinations for Veterans before 1982 had very high pass rates which increased overall ethnic biase toward Mainlanders. Finally, regression results using data from 1979-92 ”Household Income and Expenditure Survey” show that, for those born between 1925-36, Mainlander government employees have lower wages than Taiwanese government employees and the differences increase with age. This is consistent with the observation that the recruitment examinations are ethnically biased for the cohort. On the other hand, for the cohorts facing unbiased examinations, those born during 1947-49 and 1950-60, there is no wage difference between Mainlander and Taiwanese government employees.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200203-31-1-87-106-a,31.1,2003,Taiwan Economic Review
An Analysis of the Market Structure and Development of Taiwan's Hospital Industry,"Jui-Fen Rachel Lu, Chee-Ruey Hsieh","hospital industry, market structure, market conduct, market performance, market competition","Expenditures in the hospital sector totaled approximately NT$280.4 billion in 1998, representing 3.14% of GDP and nearly two thirds of the National Health Expenditures. These figures attest to the importance of the hospital industry in the overall health care market. In this paper, we use the structure-behavior-performance paradigm of industrial organization analysis to shed light on the trends in development of Taiwan's hospital industry. We conclude that the type of payment system adopted by the government exerts considerable influence on the market structure and nature of competition among hospitals. As opposed to other industries, the most distinct feature of the current hospital industry in Taiwan is that hospitals compete primarily on a nonprice basis. An important area of future research will therefore be to assess the economic impact resulting from the various proposed reforms in Taiwan's payment system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200203-31-1-107-153-a,31.1,2003,Taiwan Economic Review
The Formation of Open Trade Policy in Taiwan's Information Technology Industry,"Chih-Cheng Chen, Ming-Chung Chang","Taiwan's economic development, information technology industry, policy formation, open trade policy","This paper begins by showing that Taiwan's trade policy in developing the information technology industry is extraordinarily open, compared with other major countries' policies as well as Taiwan's own earlier policy in developing target industries. This paper explores why Taiwan adopted the above open policy. We firstly develop the following four hypotheses: 1.The failure of protected target industries such as the automobile industry gave protection policy a negative image. 2. It was believed that the domestic market is too small and hence the industry should target the foreign market. 3. Taiwan's information technology industry was not believed able to prosper. 4. Foreign interest groups levied pressures on Taiwan to open the market. The main materials we use to investigate these hypotheses include the communiqués of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, and the commentaries in the Commercial Times and the Economic Daily News, which have been the two most famous newspapers focusing on economic affairs in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200212-30-4-421-463-a,30.4,2002,Taiwan Economic Review

Two testing procedures are employed. One is proposed by Toda and Phillips (1993, 1994), which employs a Johansen-type error correction model. The other is a lag-augmented VAR approach, proposed by Toda and Yamamoto (1995), which need not take into account possible integration and cointegration among series. Empirical results from both approaches appear to reject the null hypothesis of Granger no-causality from export to output.

The empirical results show that positive net entry will decrease concentration. In addition, entry is motivated by expected profits, market demand growth, market size and the US market growth. The minimum efficient scale to market size, the capital requirement and product differentiation are factors discouraging. Moreover, research and development is a means of entry to markets by new firms. Through the estimation of barriers, we found some industries, which show low entry barriers and high entry, but high levels of concentration.

An Empirical Analysis of Determination of Housing Prices in the Taipei Area,"Ming-Chi Chen, Kanak Patel","house price, cointegration, error-correction model","The volatile behaviour of Taipei housing prices is analysed using econometric models in this study. Alternative econometric models are specified to explain a number of special features of the Taipei housing market including the strong investment demand emanating both from domestic and foreign monetary expansion, excess demand fuelling price expectations and short-run variability in housing prices. We attempt to analyse alternative specifications of backward and forward looking expectation mechanisms, as well as a non-linear price term, to capture the rapid price adjustment behaviour. The results of the long-run equilibrium model indicate that household income is the most important long-run housing price determinant. The short-run dynamic models suggest housing investment variables such as stock prices and money supply are essential. The non-linear price term provides a good estimation of short-run fluctuations in housing prices but the forward-looking expectations mechanism is not helpful.

This paper instead constructs an open-economy model under fixed exchange rates. The model we set up includes the agricultural market, the non-agricultural market, the money market, and the foreign exchange market. Based on this open-economy model, we study the characteristics agricultural product prices will exhibit when the monetary authorities engage in a pre-announced monetary policy. Two main conclusions emerge from the analysis. Firstly, the expansion of domestic credit will not affect agricultural product prices, but induce the level of foreign exchange reserves decrease to the same extent as domestic credit. Secondly, agricultural product prices rise process during the period following the announcement but prior to the monetary expansion, while they decline after policy implementation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200209-30-3-313-333-a,30.3,2002,Taiwan Economic Review

In our two-period model with endogenous adjustment cost, if the inter-sectoral capital is specific initially and is mobile in second period, 'gradualism' will be better than 'shock'. The existence of adjustment cost may affect the speed of liberalization, but it does not imply a case for gradualism. When the cost of capital adjustment is infinite, a 'big bang' will be the welfare-maximizing choice. Furthermore, even if the reallocation of capital is costless, gradual liberalization will also be the optimal trade policy.

Environmental Regulations and Air Pollution Emissions: Evidence from Taiwan Manufacturing Industries,"Jin-Long Liu, Meng-Wen Tsou, Jin-Tan Liu","environmental regulation, informal regulation, inspection, air pollution emission","This article combines plant data from the Directorate General of Budget Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) and air pollution data from the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) to investigate the relationship between formal and informal regulations and air pollution emissions. We treat inspection as an endogenous variable and use a mixed model to examine the inspection and pollution regressions simultaneously. Using plant-level data from five Taiwanese manufacturing industries, we find that the EPA inspections significantly reduce air pollution emissions. The regulators usually target plants with a higher level of pollution emissions. Large-scale, energy-intensive, and less-productive plants have higher level of pollution emissions. In contrast, foreign-owned and export oriented plants are cleaner than local counterparts and domestic-market-oriented plants. Our results also support the informal regulation hypothesis that local in come is negatively associated with the pollution emissions. Regulators are more likely to inspect younger plants, plants of large-scale and plants with a large local employment share.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200209-30-3-361-382-a,30.3,2002,Taiwan Economic Review

In doing this, the rice price data are averaged by year to remove the seasonal variation. then year-based data are further de-trended to compute the correlation coefficients of pairwise prefectures in each group used to form the correlation matrix. Two index functions of the correlation matrix are produced to measure the integration of rice markets.

Corporate Tax Integration and Income Distribution in Dynamic Equilibrium,Lily Jiang,"corporate tax integration, dynamic general equilibrium, income distribution","This paper investigates the distribution effects of integrating corporate and personal income taxes in a dynamic general equilibrium model characterized by endogenous formation of income distribution. Given inherent heterogeneity in economic agents' rates of time preference, a unique distribution of income naturally emerges. In this setting, the study analyzes agents' reaction to integration and makes comparisons of income inequalities between the original steady state and the new one. Simulation results suggest that tax integration cuts down income inequality and the equalization effect is positively correlated with the degree of integration. AI; to the efficiency effect, partial integration is shown to be a Pareto improvement, whereas, full integration may generate efficiency gains or asses, depending on the ratio of earnings retained and the difference between the two tax rates. Finally, the transitional dynamics show that partial integration is effective with respect to both inequality and aggregate variables.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200206-30-2-205-227-a,30.2,2002,Taiwan Economic Review
Compatibility Choices and Network Product Markets,"Chung-Hui Chou, Dach-Rahn Wu","compatibility choice, network externalities, two-way compatibility, one-way compatibility","This paper proposes a model to analyze compatibility decision problems encountered by network product providers in their attempts to deal with markets which, although segmented, are nevertheless interdependent through the network effect. We demonstrate that the compatibility decisions of these network product providers are influenced by the number of consumers indicating an interest in e-commerce, consumer attitudes towards e-commerce, and the number of firms planning to engage in e-commerce business, with the occurrence of either 'full compatibility' or 'one-way compatibility' outcomes being possible in equilibrium. The intuition behind a one-way compatibility Outcome is that when treated as a Strategic device, the compatibility decision can enhance a brand's competitiveness in the web server software market, at the expense of weakening its competitiveness in the browser market. Therefore, if the network effects on user benefits provided by a web server's Software brand are comparatively small, whilst the network effects on the utility of users of a rival's browser are large, then the network product manufacturer could choose incompatibility.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200206-30-2-229-245-a,30.2,2002,Taiwan Economic Review

In addition, theoretical studies associated with instrumental voting, e.g., the expected utility maximization model, the minimax regret model, and game-theoretic models cannot successfully explain the resulting voter turnouts. Our experimental evidence also shows that subjects are more willing to vote when the situation is framed as one in which they will lose something if they make wrong decisions rather Ian one in which they will gain something if they make right decisions, but only in relatively small sizes of electorates.

Technology Licensing under Tariff and Quota Policies,"Shih-Jey Wu, Ya-Po Yang, Hong Hwang","Tariff, Equivalent Quota, Technology Transfer, and Royalty","International development experiences have shown that it is difficult for developing countries to catch up with the technology level of developed countries. To overcome this difficulty, developing countries often adopt some trade measures to help import foreign advanced technologies. This paper uses a two-country duopoly model to examine the efficacy of tariff and quota policies. It is found that a slight tariff or quota restriction can induce a complete foreign technology transfer from the foreign monopolist to the domestic potential entrant. The optimal royalty payment of the technology transfer is negatively related to tariff rates but in does not vary with the level of quota restriction. Finally, domestic welfare is necessarily higher but foreign welfare is necessarily lower under the tariff policy than the equivalent quota policy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200203-30-1-49-75-a,30.1,2002,Taiwan Economic Review

Who are NTU Students?-Differences across Ethnic and Gender Groups and Urban/Rural Discrepancy,Ming-Ching Luoh,"National Taiwan University, gender, ethnicity, urban/rural discrepancy","Using student records between 1954 and 2000, this paper investigates the gender, ethnic and urban/rural composition of NTU students, and discusses the selection effect of the University Entrance Examination. First, the proportion of  female students has been fairly close to that of male students since the late 1960s. This differs from the gender composition of college students generally for which female students consist of a smaller but increasing proportion of the student population. Second, 36% of NTU students are Mainlanders. Although the gap between Mainlanders and Taiwanese has decreased, it is still significant. Being a mainlander increase one’s prospects of becoming an NTU student more than it increases the prospect of simply becoming a college student. For the years 1997-2000, compared to a national average of 0.89%, the probability of becoming a NTU student for an 18-year-old in Taipei city is 3.06%, while the probability for Ta-An district is 6.10% and only 0.19% for Taitung county. The variation of the likelihood of entering NTU among counties is greater that that of entering colleges. In fact, the competition begins at an earlier stage where 82% of NTU students are from the top 20 senior high schools. In addition, regression results show that aggregate county level data can explain less that one-fifth of the variation. Moreover, data for the current students and the 18-to-22-year-old population, parents of NTU students are much better educated and are much more likely to be government employees, In contrast to the fact that college tuition is negatively associated with the examination scores, the probability of entering NTU is positively associated with family background.

The Mundell Proposition: A Synthesis of Literature,"Chau-Nan Chen, Ching-Chong Lai, Juin-Jen Chang","the Mundell proposition, fiscal policies, monetary policies","Robert Mundell, the winner of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Economic Science, wrote a series of papers in the 1960s. A notable feature of these papers is that the issues of papers of international finance are elegantly integrated with macroeconomic theories. From then on, a lot of new topics in international finance were developed. Among the Mundell contributions, the most significant and path-breaking one is his work on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies under alternative exchange rate systems. By assuming perfect capital mobility and zero sterilization, two conclusions are established by Mundell (1962). First, fiscal policy is entirely ineffective in raising output under flexible exchange rates but most effective in raising it under fixed exchange rates. Second, monetary policy is entirely ineffective in raising output under fixed exchange rates but most effective in raising it under flexible exchange rates. These results are now dubbed the Mundell proposition in the literature. Over the last three decades, the Mundel proposition has been refined, extended, and revised in a variety of ways.

However, consistent conclusions have not been derived yet. Furthermore, none of the studies systematically analyzed the determinants of the living standard. This article uses the households’ consumption structure as the indicator of the living standard, applies more systematical models, and uses more complete data, to find how and why the living standard of Taiwanese changed during this period. We obtain four major conclusions. (1) From 1918-1921 to 1936-1937, the living standard improved gradually, and the most significant change took place in the decade of the 1930s when the planting of ponlai rice was quickly increasing. (2) During the depression era of the 1930s, the living standard was still higher than that of the 1910s. (3) The living standard already started to deteriorate before W.W.II. broke out, and it seems not to have recovered the level of 1920-1940 until the 1960s.

Evidence is found that males have a higher probability of changing their state from N to both E and U, that married persons tend to enter state E from U and to stay at state N, that higher educated individuals are more likely to change their status from U to E, that elder workers seldom alter their status from E to N, that workers with higher estimated wage rates are more likely to change their state from E to U and from N to E, and that younger cohorts tend to remain in states U and N.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200112-29-4-511-546-a,29.4,2001,Taiwan Economic Review
The Development of Taiwan's National Health Accounts,"Jui-Fen Rachel Lu, William C.

This research project adopts OECD definitions and boundaries for health care and compiles health care expenditures to create an NHA for Taiwan that conforms to the international standard. In addition, data from several surveys on out-of-pocket expenditures were also collected, analyzed and validated. Adjustments were then made to the household survey data to enhance the accuracy and completeness of the estimates. The results show that the estimated 1998 health care expenditures are NT$ 526,744,959,645 (6.02% GDP). The insurance sector covers 52%, the private sector, 39%, and the government sector only 9%.

Although Taiwan’s economics circle has ranked the various international and Taiwanese economic journals, there has been no discussion on how the circle evaluates scholars’ publications. We test what kind of journals contribute more to the promotion of associate professors. We first use a bivariate probit model to test the contribution of journals at the four different levels. We find that publications in top international journals do not contribute significantly to promotion while ordinary international journals, top and ordinary Taiwanese journals help scholars significantly. We then use a duration model to see how much publication in journals of different levels help scholars in shortening the time they serve as associate professors. The results are consistent with the bivariate probit model: ordinary international, top and ordinary Taiwanese journals help more than top international journals.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200109-29-3-263-275-a,29.3,2001,Taiwan Economic Review

Different criteria of appraisal provided by the three most influential schools of economic methodology-instrumentalism, a priori methodology, and falsificationism-are used to explain the success and decline of kinked demand curves in economics. We find that in the history of kinked demand curves economists put much emphasis on the reality of assumptions and adopt criteria of appraisal quite different from instrumentalism. We also find that although the predictions of kinked demand curves are repeatedly rejected by empirical tests, most economic textbooks still accept this theory as the standard explanation of price rigidity. This historical fact is obviously inconsistent with falsificationism. We believe that the puzzling phenomena found in the history of kinked demand curves reflect the profound influence of a priori methodology on economics.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200109-29-3-277-302-a,29.3,2001,Taiwan Economic Review

The Influence of Noise Trading on Monetary Policy and the Stock Market,Chun-An Li,"monetary policy, stock price, noise trading","While the issue of monetary neutrality has been extensively investigated, none of the related theoretical and empirical studies has been devoted to the important influence of noise trading. The basic model of this paper is similar to Boyle and Peterson (1995). However; the activity of noise trading is considered in this paper. The main result of this study shows that the existence of noise traders and their misperceptions concerning the security price have two opposing effects on the relationship between monetary policy and the stock price. On the positive side, insider trading will increase the volatility of the stock prices, thus making the effect of the given monetary policy more obvious. On the negative side, it will offset the increasing or decreasing pressure on the stock price, thus making the effect of the given monetary policy more ambiguous. The former effect implies that money is not neutral.

The economy accumulates capital goods which are used not only in production, but also in pollution control. The main conclusions are as follows. The progress in abatement technology causes the environmental quality to improve and the economic growth rate to rise. The progress in production technology raises the economic growth rate, but it degrades the environmental quality. The increase in environmental care causes the environmental quality to improve, but lowers the economic growth rate. If production technology and environmental care rise in the same proportion, the environmental quality does not change, but the economic growth rate can be raised. If the percentage rise in environmental care is much larger than that of production technology, the environmental quality can be improved, with the economic growth rate unaffected.

Data from the 1990 census shows that Mainlander males have the largest proportion of being college graduates and the highest number of schooling years for cohorts born in 1935-65 while Taiwanese females have the lowest educational attainment. For the cohort born in 1965, the gender difference within ethnic groups have disappeared while the difference between Mainlander and Taiwanese is decreasing but still significant. Using data from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey, probit regressions show that, for cohorts born in 1960-74, the most important determinant of entry to college is parental educational attainment. Grown up in Taipei or other urban area is the next important determinant while the importance of governmental education subsidies to public employees is diminishing. For the cohorts born between 1975 and 1989, since the gap of parental education between ethnic groups does lot shrink, and the Mainlanders are moving into urban area faster than the Taiwanese, family background variables indicate that the differences in educational attainment between ethnic groups will persist.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10183833-200106-29-2-117-152-a,29.2,2001,Taiwan Economic Review

We show that the univariate Markov-switching factor model in dating business chronologies will be more consistent with the CEPD-defined business chronologies than that of the multivariate case. The key point is the common factor of various marcoeconomic series no longer hold for the post-1990s in Taiwan.

The results indicate the change of labor force allocation among industries follows the characteristics of industrial structural changes over the period. Though the technical change boosting the labor productivity has the employment-reducing effect, it is offset by the employment increasing effect of continuing economic growth. Besides, technical change causes the substitution between occupations in the employment, specifically, the demand for professionals increasing most sharply. Export change following the past trick will cause a rise in the inequality of the income distribution among the five equal divisions of households.

Spatial Econometric Analyses of Organic Farming Adoption: The Case of Agricultural Census Rice Farm Households,"Ting-Ya Yang, Yun-Cih Chang, Yir-Hueih Luh","Organic Farming, Township Adoption Rate, Spatial Autocorrelation, Spatial Econometrics, Agriculture Census Data, Rice Farm Households","Under the notion of environmental-friendly and sustainable development, organic farming is gaining traction worldwide. In Taiwan, farmland allocated to organic farming has grown rapidly, up to 1.37% by 2020. Among different crop categories, rice has taken the largest share during the past two decades. Drawn from the 2015 Agriculture Census data at the township level, this study analyzed the determinants of the adoption rate of organic farming for rice farm households in Taiwan. This study departs from the previous research by considering the socioeconomic characteristics of both farm operators and household working population at average township levels. In addition, two spatial econometric models-spatial lag model and spatial error model-are used to deal with the estimation bias resulting from the spatial autocorrelation of organic adoption rates. The spatial autocorrelation index, Moran's I, which is estimated from the global spatial autocorrelation analysis, equals to 0.366, indicating that there are spatial clusters in the township adoption rate of organic farming. Results from spatial econometric analyses suggest that, the proportion of major operators at different age groups, educational levels and workday groups are the major determinants of township-level adoption rates. In addition, working-age members' gender ratio, proportion of different educational levels and portion of non-agricultural workers also explains the variations in organic adoption rate.

Nevertheless, there has been very little empirical research on the factors associated with reducing consumers' food waste in Taiwan. This study makes an attempt to explore the factors that influence consumers' intentions and behavior regarding food waste reduction via an extended theory of planned behavior (TPB), with a newly-added construct, the consumers' food management plan. We conducted a survey from April to May 2019. The questionnaires were distributed in the Love River branch of a hypermarket and the Yancheng branch of a supermarket in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. After removing samples with incomplete responses, there remained 204 valid questionnaires from the survey. We applied a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to perform the estimation. Both SPSS24 and AMOS24 software were employed. The results showed that both subjective norms and perceived behavioral control had significant positive effects, while attitude had no significant effect on the intention to reduce food waste. The intention to reduce food waste has a significant negative effect on food waste behavior. By contrast, the impact of perceived behavioral control on food waste behavior was not significant. Nevertheless, perceived behavioral control had a significant positive effect on the consumers' food management plan. The food management plan had a significant negative effect on food waste behavior. These findings imply that establishing a good example within a family may positively influence other family members in reducing food waste. Moreover, guiding consumers towards the implementation of food management plans was found to be useful in reducing food waste. Finally, perceived behavioral control could be improved through measures such as reducing the level of inconvenience and increasing consumer autonomy, for instance by increasing the variety of packaging sizes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202206-202208220004-202208220004-43-74,111.0,2022,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Utilizing the Taiwan KLEMS Database with 30 industry level input output data in 1981-2015, we adopt Jorgenson et al. (2007) productivity measurement framework to measure the aggregate and industry level productivity growth as well as the capital and labor reallocation effects in different periods. Empirical results indicate that internal productivity growth within industry is the major source of Taiwan's aggregate productivity growth in 1981-2015, whereas cross industry resource reallocation effect contributes averagely 16% of productivity growth despite the size of such effect may vary in different periods. Among resource reallocation effects, labor reallocation has been the main contributor before the year of 2000, however, after 2001 capital reallocation plays the key role. The labor reallocation effect even became negative after 2011, which implies that a demand for government to promote labor smooth movement industrial policy in the future. Results also find that ICT sectors have contributed more than 50% of aggregated productivity growth of Taiwan after 1991, whereas the contribution from ICT producing sectors is greater than that from ICT using sectors.

The Effect of The Spatial Dispersion of Convenience Stores on House Prices: A Spatial Analysis in Taipei Metropolis,Ti-Ching Peng,"House Prices, Convenience Store, Spatial Dispersion, Spatial Spillover Effect","Unlike other retailers in Taiwan, convenience stores are not agglomerated in a single spatial point, but spread densely over urban areas. The effect of convenience stores on house prices is subject to its spatial dispersion. Convenience stores (with similar goods and services) would have geographic retailing edge if its location allows residents to ＂happen to pass by＂ to satisfy their needs; moreover, spatial dispersion ensures the retailing balance among stores in agglomeration competition. Whether spatial spillover effect exists is worth further exploration. This study adopted three types of spatial models (spatial lag model, spatial lagged X model and spatial Durbin model) to examine the effect of two accessibility indicators of convenience stores - ＂spatial density＂ (total number of convenience stores within 100 meters of each residence) and ＂spatial dispersion＂ (distance among convenience stores within 100 meters of each residence) - on property prices in Taipei Metropolis. It is found that ＂spatial density＂ was not influential to property values but ＂spatial dispersion＂ had spatial spillover effect on property prices. That is, if convenience stores agglomerate but keep certain distance among each other, it allows residents to easily pass by stores and shop, and this spatial dispersion advantage of nearby properties would spillover to our residence (or vice versa). In summary, while spatial agglomeration allows retailing efficiency, ＂clustering but still keeping distance＂ should allow stores to hold competitive advantages, elevate living convenience and local property values in neighbourhoods.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202112-202202080019-202202080019-51-104,110.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Mixed Oligopoly and Optimal Trade Policy in the Presence of Domestic Private Firms,Horn-In Kuo,"Trade Policy, Privatization, Mixed Oligopoly, Domestic Private Firms, Non-Linear Demand","Long and Stähler (2009) examine the impact of privatization on strategic trade policy in an international mixed oligopolistic market with a non-linear demand function, however, the paper does not consider the presence of domestic private firms, so there is no cost-saving effect of privatization policy. In view of this, this paper takes the presence of domestic private firms into account. According to this paper, the cost-saving effect plays a key role, and the cost-saving effect of privatization policy will make the equilibrium price of the market, optimum tariff rate, and social welfare related to the degree of privatization rather than independent of each other under the optimal trade policy, and social welfare will increase with the increase of the degree of privatization. Therefore, the optimal privatization policy should be fully privatized. The optimal subsidy rate and the degree of privatization are not monotonically incremental in nature. All of these results are different from the findings of Long and Stähler (2009).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202112-202202080019-202202080019-105-129,110.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Mitigation Effects on Farmland Fragmentation through Land Consolidation in Chiayi County,"Hsiu-Yin Ding, Tzu-Chin Lin, Chia-Hsin Liu","Joint Ownership, Land Fragmentation, Land Consolidation, HHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index)","Farmland fragmentation is the oldest problem of farmland use around the world, and land consolidation have been proposed as a major solution to this problem. Numerous studies has agreed on the functions of land consolidation on mitigating fragmentation and simplifying the severity of joint ownership on land. Over one hundred thousand plots within 49 land consolidation projects in Chiayi County are examined using a two-stage estimator regression model to understand if the longer the time has passed after land consolidation the more fragmented the farmland has become in terms of plot area and land ownership, respectively. It is found that, in contrast to latter land consolidation projects, those plots in the land consolidation projects implemented earlier have become smaller in size but their ownership has remained simpler. These results suggest that the plots with joint ownership have been divided into a larger number of smaller plots with single ownership. Moreover, the status of plot size and land ownership (single or joint) at the time of completion of a land consolidation project to a large extent determines the degree of fragmentation in plot size and land ownership for many years into the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202112-202202080019-202202080019-131-162,110.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The results of the study indicate that, on the whole, in the first crop of 2020, the agri-environment basic payment cost about NTD 940 million, the fallow land restored about 2,466 ha. Regarding the restoration of fallow land, the direct benefits are about NTD 730 million to NTD 770 million, and the overall benefit (direct benefit plus indirect benefit) is about NTD 1.03 billion to NTD 1.06 billion. Since the people generally believe that the ecological value of fallow farmland is higher than that of farmland operated by conventional farming methods. Therefore, unless fallow farmland is restored using sustainable methods, the ecological benefits of fallow farmland restoration are limited or even net losses. The agri-environment basic payment may be helpful for that farmland used for farming, but it may not be beneficial to the ecological benefit. Therefore, the government should clarify the role of the agri-environment basic payment in the direct payment policy. If the government wants to promote ecological benefits through the agri-environment basic payment, it should further reform related supporting measures and implementation methods.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202112-202202080019-202202080019-163-219,110.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The numbers of the ICW data are manually collected from the prospectuses of initial public offering and seasoned equity offering firms (hereafter IPO/SEO). The CPAs were required to set forth their suggestions for the improvement of the internal control system and ICWs in the prospectuses for the last three years. We employed three variables: research and development expenditures (hereafter R&D), patent numbers, and innovation efficiency to proxy for corporate innovation capability. The empirical results show that firms with more ICWs have higher amount of recognized assets impairment loss. There is a negative relationship between innovation capability and the amount of recognized assets impairment loss. However, the negative relationship will be depressed for firms with more ICWs, implying that internal control quality and innovation capability both play an important role in a firm's assets valuation decisions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202112-202202080019-202202080019-221-262,110.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Unity is Strength? Assessing the Economic Impacts of Farmer Organization Membership on the Primary Farm Households,"Yir-Hueih Luh, Min-Han Tsai, Shih-Yun Yang","Farmer Organization Membership, Influencing Factors, Economic Effects, Multinomial Sample Selection Model","There are three types of farmer organizations in Taiwan: farmer associations (FAs), agricultural production and marketing groups (APMGs), and agricultural cooperatives (Coops), which is different from most of the countries in the world. Due to the differences in hierarchy, managerial and operating aims and goals, and member compositions among the three, the effects of farmer organization participation may also vary. This study utilizes the Primary Farmer Household Survey (PFHS) conducted in 2013 by the Taiwanese government. The empirical research estimates the determining factors and the average treatment effects of farmer organization participation based on a multinomial sample selection model. The factors influential to the participation behavior and the choice of joining a certain type of farmer organization are annual working days on own-held farm, production scale (measured by in-household labor and cultivate land area), prior work experience, and main conducting types (husbandry or agriculture) or crop types. The economic impacts of participation are also confirmed. The results show that, after controlling for the social-economic variables affecting farmer households' profit and the endogeneity arising from self-selection, farm households participating in APMGs or Coops reveal better economic performance than those joining FAs or non-participants. The participation in APMGs brings an average treatment effect of agricultural profits for 88,000 NTD, and Coops for 44,000 NTD. In addition to being smaller than the FAs, APMGs and Coops are characterized by higher level of vertical-integration. The results therefore suggest that the formation of small in scale but highly integrated organizations such as APMGs and Coops can be a promising path to overcome the challenges confronted by the smallholder farmers in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202106-202108170006-202108170006-1-39,109.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Following the standard procedure of the contingent valuation method, we conducted an in-person survey using a representative sample of major farm households randomly drawn by the Bureau of Census. We applied the method of Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) to estimate farmers' willingness to pay for weather information service. The estimated results show that a farmer is willing to pay 4,134 NTD~4,307 NTD per year for the weather information service and thus the total economic benefits of weather information service is 395.38 million NTD~643.97 million per year. We also evaluate the potential economic benefit that can be realized and find that the benefits of weather information service can reach 577.66 million NTD~941.16 million per year.

A Study on the Determination of the Revenue Insurance Premium Rate of Sugar Apple: Application of Copula's Joint Probability Density Function,"Min-Hsien Yang, Nana Chao, Ruihua Yang","Agricultural Insurance, Revenue Insurance, Copula Probability Distribution, Premium Rate","Crop revenue insurance is a new trend in the development of agricultural insurance. Since crop revenue insurance can avoid natural risks and price risks to ensure the stability of farmers' income, it has become increasingly popular abroad recently. Due to the negative correlation between output and price, this article based on the yield and price changes of Taiwanese sugar apple revenue insurance, uses the copula joint probability density function to determine the insurance premium rates at different revenue-base and degree of protection, and compares with the empirical results of historical simulation method. It is expected that findings of this article would improve the design of Taiwanese sugar apple revenue insurance, and provide the actuarial meaning of rate determination. The estimated result shows that the higher the degree of protection, the higher the insurance rate. In terms of 100% protection, the pure premium rate of each region is between 2.22% and 8.12%. Based on different revenue-base, the premium per hectare is 25,303 NT dollar to 95,463 NT dollar. The result of the copula method insurance premium rate determination is further compared with the current actual premium estimated by the historical simulation method. Because the limited yield and price data of the historical simulation method may not reflect the true probability and magnitude of loss, the premiums in high-risk areas are underestimated and low-risk areas have the problem of overestimating premiums, which may not necessarily ensure financial balance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202106-202108170006-202108170006-83-114,109.0,2021,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Then machine-learning decision tree and random forest regressions are adopted to examine the impact of healthcare accessibility on housing prices in Taipei Metropolis, Taiwan. Random forest algorithm, as an ensemble of numberous decision trees, performed better in overall model prediction. Both machine-learning algorithms revealed that three types of medical accessibility for elders have significant effects on housing prices. Given that average life expectancy tends to be much higher in Taipei Metropolis than other regions, to elders in need of medical resources for chronic diseases in daily lives, the physician and hospital bed are proven to be more important than ambulance (needed for emergency treatment).

This article explores the economic impact of the US-China friction on Taiwan's semiconductor and ICT (Information and Communication Technology) industry from 2017 to 2020. This paper uses the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and Input-Output table to simulate the impact of the US-China friction on industries through in-depth interviews with industry experts. In the first stage, the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) are used to analyze the impact of 10%~25% tariffs imposed by the United States and China on Taiwan's macro-economy and the import and export prices of individual industries. Based on the results of the first stage and the opinions of industry experts, the second stage uses the General Equilibrium Model for Taiwanese Economy and Environment (GEMTEE) model to analyze the impact on Taiwan's semiconductor and ICT industry. The simulation results show that the US-China friction will have a negative impact on Taiwan's macro-economy, but the impact is much smaller than the estimates of some research institutions, which shows that Taiwanese manufacturers will benefit from the order transfer effect. However, when the tariff is increased to 25%, the order transfer effect will be largely offset by the impact of the global economic downturn, and the impact on the semiconductor industry will be greater than the impact on the ICT industry. To reduce the impact of the US-China friction on Taiwan's industries, manufacturers should strive to diversify business risks, increase business flexibility and resilience, strengthen R&D to improve competitiveness, and introduce smart manufacturing to cope with the impact of US-China friction. The feature of this study is an emphasis on bottom-up research methods. Through repeated discussions with industry experts, the situation settings and parameter calibration are reviewed to make the simulation more reasonable and in line with practical conditions.

Grouper is an important exporting item from Taiwan to mainland China. Moreover, since the original tariff rate of the grouper in mainland China is quite high, the impact of the tariff reduction should be large. Applying the vector error correction model and using the monthly data from January 2003 to March 2016, we analyze the adjustment direction, adjustment speed, and the reasons for the adjustment when the export of grouper from Taiwan and mainland China deviates from its long-term trend. Then we apply forecast error variance decomposition to estimate the size of the tariff reduction on the export of grouper from Taiwan to mainland China. The Johansen cointegration test shows that the export of grouper from Taiwan to mainland China has a long-term equilibrium relation with other important variables. Moreover, the empirical results show that the income elasticity of demand for imported grouper in mainland China is 8.942; while the elasticity of substitution between grouper of Taiwan and grouper of mainland China is 0.0028.

Like other seaside settlements in Taiwan, agriculture and fishing are the main sources of livelihood; residents also worship the goddess Matsu. Each year, the Baishatun Matsu makes a pilgrimage to Beikang; this is what is considered the Baishatun Matsu incense-offering ritual. This annual event is a longstanding one and steeped in tradition. The believers walk and offer incense; the route of the ritual is different each year as it is ＂as per instructed by the goddess＂. The intangible cultural heritage benefits brought about by the Baishatun Matsu Pilgrimage cannot be measured by the regular market goods prices; it can only be calculated using non-market good assessment methods. The Baishatun Matsu's incense promotion activity is to maintain its non-use value and use value through Pilgrimage activities. Which means that the Pilgrims (who have use value) maintain the non-use values of the non-users (non-Pilgrims). Consequently, the travel cost method has become the assessment method for evaluating non-use value of intangible cultural heritage. The Travel Cost Method (TCM) generally cannot assess non-use value. However, only if the Baishatun Matsu Pilgrimage keep on conduct, the use value could have connected with option value, existence value and bequest value, the nonuse value. This article uses the Travel Cost Method (TCM) to evaluate the intangible cultural heritage benefits of the Baishatun Matsu Pilgrimage activity, and creates a new benefit evaluation aspect of the travel cost method. Moreover, the study uses TCM to assess the intangible cultural heritage benefits of the Baishatun Matsu Pilgrimage and combines it with the multi-criteria decision-making method (MCDM) to understand the proportion of six major values: ＂spiritual satisfaction＂, ＂passing the torch＂, ＂leisure and tourism＂, ＂hometown sense of belonging＂, ＂physical and mental exercise＂, and ＂emotional exchange＂ in the hearts of the ritual participants to come up with the benefits brought about by the Baishatun Matsu Pilgrimage. The study uses the travel cost method as a base and utilizes the truncated Poisson model as the analytical tool to calculate the consumer surplus (CS) of ritual participants. Results show that, combined with the proportion obtained from the multi-criteria decision-making method, the direct use value of each person each time is NT$ 17,623 and non-direct use value is NT$ 30,174. What makes this different from the other studies is that the use of the multi-criterion decision-making (MCDM) weights with the assessment results of the travel cost method (TCM) to estimate indirect use value, which negated the limitation of the travel cost method only being able to calculate direct value. It is hoped that the results of this study may serve an important reference for Baishatun Gong-Tian Temple or government agencies in making policies for the protection and preservation of intangible cultural heritage.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-202006-202008070012-202008070012-213-261,107.0,2020,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The Simulation of a Long-term Equilibrium to MPAs under Environmental Uncertainties,"Shan-Non Chin, Ming-Sian Liu","Marine Protection Reserves, Fishing Areas, Open Access Model, Fish Stock, Long-run Equilibrium","To effectively manage fishery resources, many studies suggest that the establishment of marine protection reserves (MPAs) lead to higher fishery yields than conventional management. The idea of MPAs is to allow fish stock to rebuild by creating a comprehensive protection for its habitat. It also yields benefits in terms of tourism and academic research. However, under the increasing uncertainty of marine environments, it is worthy to investigate whether MPAs still serve as a long-term optimal equilibrium of resource management and protection. The model in this study divides the marine environment into two areas: a fishing zone and a no-take zone, in which all fishing and extraction are prohibited. The latter preserves the original habitat, promotes the growth of fish stocks, and helps increase fishery yields in the fishing zone through spillover effect. Also, this study investigates the effects of environmental uncertainty on the profit maximization model and the open access model, along with the impacts of treating exploitation rate as an exogenous variable. Simulation results suggest that although fish stock will decrease with the increase of MPA sizes in the profit maximization model, the resources are still sustainable. Also, the increase of MPA sizes can stabilize the fishery yield in the long-run equilibrium even with uncertainty in the environment. In the open access model with exploitation rate treated as an exogenous variable, the results show that under all scenarios of uncertainty and exploitation rate, the fish stock rebuild better when the size of the protected area is at a high level in the long-run equilibrium.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201912-202002070012-202002070012-39-65,106.0,2019,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The results indicated that the average overall inefficiency score is 0.372 in which the inefficiencies are mainly from the use of pesticide and fertilizer. Therefore, it means that tea plantations have room to improve by 37.2% on average and the improvement of the use of pesticide and fertilizer is more important than other input uses. The comparisons of different groups of farmers showed that younger farmer, specialized production, and planting just two varieties of tea are helpful for the tea production in Pinglin.

Does Corporate Social Responsibility Make Banks More Cost Efficient?,"Lien-Wen Liang, Hai-Yen Chang, Jun-Han Liu","Corporate Social Responsibility, Stochastic Metafrontier Approach, Banking Industry, Cost Efficiency","Corporate social responsibility (CSR) has emerged and developed worldwide since the early 1990s. With most bank deposits coming from the general public, CSR is playing an even more important role in the banking industry. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of CSR programs on the cost efficiency of Taiwanese banks, by employing the stochastic frontier approach (SFA) of Battese and Coelli (1995) and the stochastic metafrontier approach (SMF) of Huang et al. (2014) on a sample of 15 financial holding company (FHC) subsidiary banks and 21 independent banks from 2006 to 2012. The empirical results indicate that FHC subsidiary banks and independent banks differ significantly based on four dimensions: corporate governance, sustainability, public welfare, and disclosure of CSR information. We find that independent director and CSR report increase the cost efficiency of FHC subsidiary banks, but reduce that of independent banks. Bigger board size and longer years of establishment decrease the cost efficiency of FHC subsidiary banks, but increase that of independent banks. In contrast, government-imposed penalties reduce the cost efficiency of FHC subsidiary banks more than independent banks, however, the cost efficiencies of both types of banks fall with higher risk and rise with labor union. Overall, the results of the metafrontier approach show that FHC subsidiary banks outperform independent banks in terms of technology gap ratio (TGR) and metafrontier cost efficiency (MCE).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201912-202002070012-202002070012-107-146,106.0,2019,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
The Dynamic Relationships between Fear Gauges and Crude Oil Price under Multiple Structural Changes,"Wei Tsai, Jeng-Bau Lin, Fang-Chin Chen","Multiple Structural Changes, Fear Gauge, Sequential Procedure Methods, Global Political and Economic Events, Short-Term Speculation Spread","Global political and economic events usually cause the structural changes of crude oil price behavior. If this problem concerning structural changes is not considered, the testing result would produce estimation bias which leads to incorrect explanation and inference. This paper investigates the long-run and short-run dynamic relationships between crude oil price and Crude oil volatility index (OVX) and between the price and stock market volatility index (VIX). The empirical result finds six structural change points by which further divide into seven sub-periods that relevant events occurred per sub-period. This study also finds that, because of the structural changes there exists the ARDL-ECM co-integrating relationship between oil price and VIX. If the seven sub-period data are inspected one by one, this relationships hold for the 2^(nd), 3^(rd), 4^(th), 6^(th) and 7^(th) sub-periods, while this relationships between oil price and OVX hold for the 2^(nd), 4^(th) and 6^(th) sub-periods. Furthermore, for the entire observation period, the two-way Granger causality holds for the price, but the price Granger causes VIX only. If the seven sub-period data are inspected again, VIX Granger causes the price only for the 1^(st) and 2^(nd) sub-period, but OVX Granger causes the price only for the 5^(th) and 6^(th) sub-periods. Finally, for the entire observation period, the price and OVX are affected by their 15 period lags each other, but VIX is affected by 8 period lag of the price. If the seven sub-period data are examined, VIX is affected by 2 period lag and 3 period lag of the price for the 1^(st) and 2^(nd) sub-period, respectively, while the price is affected by 2 period lag of OVX for both the 5^(th) and 6^(th) sub-periods. This finding implies that, the fear gauges provide the investors with the more market efficiency during the sub-periods than during the whole sampling period. Therefore, this paper suggests that, not only do the investors in the petroleum market take care of the impacts of crucial global political and economic events on the crude oil price, but they also consider the short-run dynamic relationships between the price and its volatility.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201912-202002070012-202002070012-147-177,106.0,2019,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

We obtain the following results under a Hotelling location model. Firstly, quality and process R&D investments of two hospitals could be the social optimal level under the regulated price if the degree of altruism of hospitals are symmetric but not equal to 1. Secondly, quality R&D of two perfectly public hospitals (the degree of altruism=1) would be overinvested even under regulated price. Lastly, provided that the degrees of altruism of two hospital are not equal, quality and process R&D investments of the public hospital (the more altruistic one) are both more than those of the private hospital (the less altruistic one) under the regulated price. This solution shows that only the second best levels of the quality and process R&D investments can be reached if there are multi distortions in a mixed oligopolistic health care market. The policy implication of this study is that, on the aspect of quality and process R&D investments of hospitals, given that the degrees of altruism are asymmetric, the social optimal quality and process R&D investments could be achieved if the health care price is regulated by the government.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201906-201908120018-201908120018-39-71,105.0,2019,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

There are a total of 12 indicators examined in this study. The assessment shows that there exist significant differences in financial conditions among different levels, industrial characteristics, and locations of local governments. In addition, this study applies the panel data estimation methodology to investigating determinants of local governments' financial conditions. The fixed effect model estimation results show that the business sales amount is positively correlated with the local government's financial condition; on the other hand, the number of residents and the ratio of social welfare expenditures to total expenditures are negatively correlated. The local financial problems in election years are much more severe than others. Controlling for potential determinants, there also shows downward trend in comprehensive financial condition indicator, implying that the local financial condition becomes worse and worse during the sample period. Moreover, the overall local financial condition performs worst in 2009, right after the global financial crisis of 2007-08. To the best of our knowledge, the study represents the first attempt to assess the financial condition of local government in Taiwan. The results of assessing financial condition could be used by local governments to enhance accountability and to increase local government competitiveness.

(2010), this paper proposes a linear two-stage network system model with shared inputs and undesirable outputs, to analyze the technical efficiencies of Taiwanese banking industry over the period 2004-2013. As compared to the conventional DEA approach, the extended model is able to deal with the problem of shared inputs and intermediates among activities which characterize bank production in an integrated framework simultaneously, and allow us to examine aspects of production in a more comprehensive and factual manner. The results show that the average system technical efficiency score over the sample period is 0.896, suggesting that there is a 10.4% room for FCUs to improve their efficiency. The decomposition indicates that the average efficiency in phase 1 is 0.821 and that of phase 2 is 0.958, signifying that the efforts to improve inputs utilization efficiency in phase 1 are more important than efforts to improve loan and investment creation and problem loan control efficiencies in phase 2. It is also found that the 2008 financial crisis and the European Debt Crisis did not have significantly impacts on the performances of domestic banks. The comparisons of the performances of different groups of banks demonstrate that the banks with mixed private-public-ownership perform better than the private banks, and the financial holding banks are superior to independent banks, which suggest that joining financial holding companies would create potential synergies and helps to enhance banks' competitiveness.

Evaluating the Economic Value of Water Conservation by Taiwan National Forests,"Ching-Hua Hsieh, Wan-Yu Liu","Ecosystem Service, Economic Benefit, Water Conservation","Water is the subsistence of human beings and it can be conserved by forests. The water conservation value is a kind of indirect use value. With the continued consumption of natural resources, the problem of water scarcity has been becoming important. Estimating the value of water conservation becomes critical to investigate the sustainable use of water resources by forest. However, estimating the value of water is difficult. The estimates are easily affected by many factors, such as climate, topography, and data sources. Therefore, it is challenging to estimate the value of water accurately in a practical way. In this study, a water balance model with replacement cost is adopted to estimate the value of water conservation in eight national forest districts in Taiwan. The estimated water conserved in the national forest districts is approximately 29,967,841,946.00 m^3 annually and the average cost for reservoirs is NT$ 0.10/m^3. The economic value of the water stored in Taiwan's national forest districts is estimated to be NT$ 3,102,671,667.08 per year. The result of this study indicates that the capability of conserving water by forests conforms to rainfalls generally. In addition, the discounted cost of each reservoir in Taiwan has large variations in the assessment process. This study also suggests that we should consider water sources, in addition to the data scale, to improve the estimation accuracy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201812-201902130013-201902130013-185-228,104.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

CEO Pay-for-performance Relation: Asymmetric or Symmetric?,"Chii-Shyan Kuo, Shih-Ti Yu","CEO Compensation, Quantile Regression, Pay-for-performance Relation","The optimal contacting theory suggests a symmetric relation between CEO pay and firm performance. That is, CEO pay-for-performance sensitivity should remain relatively constant regardless of whether a firm performs good or bad. However, the extant empirical evidence on this issue still reveals lack of consensus. We argue that several factors may increase the heterogeneity of pay-for-performance sensitivity. In this study, we adopt an innovative approach, quantile regression to reexamine how CEO pay-performance sensitivities vary across different levels of CEO pay. We find that conditionally high-CEO equity holding and CEO total pay have a stronger pay-for-performance relation than conditionally low-CEO equity holding and CEO total pay. This suggests that OLS (ordinary least square) may not be an optimal solution to examine this relation. Since the OLS estimate of pay-for-performance sensitivity mainly focuses on the mean relation, and therefore the conclusion based on OLS could be misleading. Additional analyses suggest that large-sized firms demonstrates incremental positive effects of stock return on CEO equity holding. This incremental positive impact of stock return on CEO pay is more pronounced when CEO total pay is used. This could be driven by the fact that pay package for CEOs of small-sized firms comprises a greater portion of cash compensation, attenuating the pay-for-performance sensitivity, and therefore broadening the difference in pay-for-performance between large- and small-sized firms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201806-201808080009-201808080009-1-44,103.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Factors Leading to Increased Carbon Dioxide Emissions of Taiwan: The LMDI Decomposition Analysis,"Bwo-Nung Huang, Jia-Jan Lee","Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index, Per Capita Carbon Dioxide Emissions, Energy Intensity, Energy Coefficient","This research applies the LMDI multiplicative decomposition to carbon dioxide emissions of Taiwan between 1971 and 2014. As Taiwan once use up to 51.71% of nuclear power in generating their electricity in 1985. One aim of this research is to understand the effect of possible reducing carbon dioxide emissions through using of nuclear power. Based on the period of intensive using of nuclear power, this research segments the 44-year of data into 6-period for most period contain 8-year time span. We summarized the results of this research as follows: Before 2000, the major effects that cause the increasing in carbon dioxide emissions are population increase and economic growth as during this period Taiwan economy experience rapid growth both in economic and population. To meet the demand of rapid economic growth, Taiwan starts to increase the share of nuclear power in generating their electricity during 1977~1985. Based on the decomposition results, we witness the slowdown of carbon dioxide emissions perhaps due to the improvement of intensity effect (ΔI) and coefficient effect (ΔCE) in the period of 1977~1985. After 2000, the slowdown of economic growth alone with the lowest birth rate in the world of Taiwanese seems not benefit the reduction of Taiwan carbon dioxide emissions a lot. Part of the reason for continuing increase in carbon dioxide emissions after 2000 might be because so called ＂nuclear-free homeland＂ becomes popular in Taiwan. Thus, the share of using nuclear in generating electricity has sharply decline to 16.03% in 2014. Without enough renewable energy back up, the fuel mix of generating electricity power has shift toward using fossil fuel especially coal again. As a result, the coefficient effect starts to deteriorate which offset the improving in intensity and structure (ΔS) effect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201806-201808080009-201808080009-45-76,103.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

From the empirical results, we conclude that the overall labour force exhibits discouraged worker effect. However, the relationships between labour force participation and unemployment are varying according to gender, education, age and geographic location. The males, education level with junior high or below, age between 15 and 24 and between 45 and 64 labour force exhibit discouraged worker effect. The females, education level with high school and age between 25 and 44 labour force exhibit added worker effect. The labor force with university education level or higher otherwise coincides with the unemployment invariance hypothesis. Besides, the discouraged worker effect will be lessened during the contraction phase of business cycle and the effect of contraction on the added worker effect will differ according to the characteristics of labor force.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201806-201808080009-201808080009-77-140,103.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The empirical results indicate that the relationship between service quality and hotel profitability is nonlinear, with different changes over time and among hotels and transition variables. Moreover, labor costs influence the marginal effects of service quality on hotel profitability, indicating that average employee wages can have a nonlinear influence on hotel profitability. Finally, when labor costs are under the threshold value, service quality (in terms of guest rooms or food and beverages) has a positive effect on hotel profitability, and the effect of food and beverage quality is more obvious than the effect of guest room quality. However, once labor costs exceed the threshold value, the marginal effect of service quality on hotel profitability will be inconsistent and may even result in an overall decline in hotel profitability.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201806-201808080009-201808080009-183-205,103.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The results showed that the most efficient units were Wufeng Township of Hsinchu County and Mudan Township in Pingtung County. However, there were more than 70% of study sample can improve their technical efficiency and pure technical efficiency. In addition, the homestay industry expressed in a state of increasing returns to scale which may resulted from insufficient inputs. Finally, number of guest rooms, ratio of revenue from meals and revenue from rooms, average price, and ratio of illegal homestay facilities to legal homestay facilities had significant positive impacts on technical efficiency, while ratio of revenue of hostel, and revenue of homestay facilities had significant negative impacts on technical efficiency of homestay. In order to improve operate efficiency, operators should improve the quality of services, and then increase the number of room occupancy. Operators should grasp the small and beautiful business philosophy, arrange staffs, combine local agricultural products, provide excellent services, and specialty dining. It is worth to mention that the ratio of illegal homestay and legal homestay rooms had significant positive impact on technical efficiency show that there is a high demand for legal homestay. However, many areas where tourism resources are abundant may be water-specific areas or hillside lands. It is difficult for operators to obtain legal qualifications. Therefore, it is suggested that Central government design a specific zone for homestay operators, therefore local government can implement penalty on illegal homestay to avoid over-development and destroy ecological environment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201806-201808080009-201808080009-207-240,103.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

In order to understand the motivation and the factors why farmers adopt agricultural facilities, this study utilizes a survey method to investigate the willingness-to-expand on their greenhouse among facility farmers. Furthermore, the key factors of decision making for different types of facility is further discussed how farmers choose the types of facility. Therefore, a Logit Model is adopted to evaluate the expanding decision for their facility which is focused on the top 10 potential facility crops, i.e., bell pepper, mushroom, small leafy vegetable, bitter squash, tomato, grape, papaya, strawberry, dancing-doll orchid, and lisianthus. And then a Multinomial Logit Model is further adopted to investigate the development of each types of facility. Through the interview survey from a total of 290 facility farmers, the empirical results show that facility farmers would like to expand their facility, especially for those who are young male farmers, from southern Taiwan, more experience with facility, join the production and marketing cooperative, emphasizing the benefit of the increasing cultivated area, agreeing to release the limitation of facility capacity, fruit facility farmers, using the wholesale market channel, and having traceability certificate. While farmers adopted different types of facility may be because their education level, land size, joined the plantation courses, from different regions, different perspectives on the benefits of facility, different crops, and different market channels. From above mentioned results we found that the willingness to expand horticulture greenhouses can be affected by different regions and age groups. Not only focusing on the productivity enhancement but also considering market channels and the characteristics of agricultural products are motivated and leading the development of facility agriculture. Therefore, it still needs to consider the motivation of the industrial development when making relative policy, so it would significantly enhance the stable development for the domestic agriculture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201806-201808080009-201808080009-241-273,103.0,2018,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The purpose of the study is to investigate the consumers' behavior and willingness to pay (WTP) for various attributes of the frozen New Year dishes. The results show that ＂convenience＂ is one of the major concerns of consumers. The major buyers of the frozen New Year dishes are married female, college educated, age of 40-59 with family size over 3 and often sharing New Year meals with 4-8 persons. The random parameter logit (RPL) model is applied in the research to cope with the heterogeneity of Consumers' WTP towards products' attributes. Our findings suggest that stewed soup (marine foodstuffs supreme) and slowly cooked dishes are more preferred by consumers. Health and safety products with brand representatives or certified are more preferred.

To reduce the number of tourists, the Kaohsiung City government started to sell tickets in July 2012. This study evaluates the influence of the entry ticket price and the management quality on the willingness of tourists to pay for the ticket to visit the site. We use the contingent valuation method (CVM) and the probit model to investigate the willingness to pay (WTP) of tourists to visit after the ticket prices increase.

This paper applies the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) developed by the European Union to compute the share of responsibility of carbon dioxide emissions for 41 countries based on five responsibility-sharing principles, over the period of 1995-2009. Our results show that developed countries will benefit most under the principle proposed by Zhou et al. (2010), while newly-developed countries will favor the sharing principle by Marques et al. (2012), which accounts the shared responsibility based on the income being received from trade. For Taiwan, the most favorable one will be that based on consumption of goods and services. Conversely, it will be responsible for more emissions under the income-based principle. This implies that Taiwan not only needs to improve its energy efficiency effectively to reduce the emissions from production, but also needs to adjust its area mix of exports to avoid the added responsibility from exporting. We also find that the income-based principle proposed by Marques et al. (2012) is relatively fair and efficient as compared to other principles. Under the principle, developed countries will have the incentive to move their production to places having less environmental impacts.

This study aims to disentangle the impacts of these two available options on the economic well-being, including earnings, income, hourly wages, happiness, of aborigines in Taiwan. Using a sample of 1,652 respondents drawn from the Taiwan Indigenous People Survey in 2008, this study estimates a multinomial sample selection model to identify the factors that are associated with aborigines' chooses of rural-urban migration or participation in government employment assistance programs. Moreover, this study distinguishes the effects of these two options on economic well-being of aborigines in Taiwan. Empirical results show that government employment assistance programs can significantly reduce the inequality of economic well-being of aborigines in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201612-201702130014-201702130014-105-148,100.0,2016,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
A Comparative Study of Disaggregate Input Efficiency of Banks in Taiwan and Mainland China: A Stochastic Metafrontier Analysis Application,"Tzu-Pu Chang, Jin-Li Hu, Ling-Huei Chiou","Stochastic Metafrontier Approach, Banking Industry, Input Efficiency, Technology Gap","After MOU and ECFA got effective, cooperation as well as competition in banking industry across Taiwan and China became deeper. This paper applies a new two-step stochastic frontier approach extended from Zhou et al. (2012) and Huang et al. (2014) to estimate technical efficiency scores for firms in different groups adopting distinct technologies. We estimate disaggregate input efficiency scores of the 56 banking companies from 2007 to 2011. The number of employees, total fixed asset and total funding are inputs, while the total loans and total investments are outputs. Our major empirical findings are as follows: The average labor efficiency score of banks in Taiwan is higher than that in mainland China. Banks in mainland China get a higher average fixed assets efficiency score. However, banks in Taiwan obtained a higher average total funding efficiency score.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201612-201702130014-201702130014-149-181,100.0,2016,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Factors Affecting Enterprises' Attitudes on Mobile Commerce and Their Economic Implications,"Ying-Chi Liao, Jian-Fu Wang","Mobile Commerce, Experience Economy, Innovation Diffusion Theory, Technology Acceptance Model","With the effectiveness of mobile commerce on raising production efficiency for enterprises, this study focuses on the factors affecting their attitudes on adopting mobile commerce. In addition to utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), our model still incorporates two other factors, compatibility and perceived risk, and analyzes them using the structural equation modeling technique. Our empirical results show that: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and compatibility all have positive effects on attitude; perceived risk has a negative effect on attitude; and perceived usefulness has a positive effect on intention to use. On the other hand, these results reveal three economic implications: (1) Service providers can reduce enterprises' perceived risk by applying the principles of experience economy; (2) Service providers can use the concept of freemium to expand their user bases by providing basic applications at first and then charge for advanced functions to obtain revenues; and (3) Service providers can provide professional consulting services for enterprises to evaluate their compatibilities of information systems when adopting mobile commerce.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201612-201702130014-201702130014-183-216,100.0,2016,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

We employed the Subjective Measure to identify over education status of our samples and adopted the Multinomial Logit model to examine potential factors causing such over education. We also applied Mincer's wage function approach to measure the impact of over education on college graduate's wage. Empirical results show that job mismatch, school and major types and labor market experience are major determinants of over education. Over education is found to have negative impact on wage. The size of such impact however differs by school type, in which the largest impact goes to public university.

Effective Exchange Rate Forecasting models and Comparison of Hedging Performances,"Chih-Nan Chen, Chien-Hsiu Lin, Bao-Jie You","Exchange Rate Hdeging, Monetary Fundamental Model, Asymmetric Taylor Rule, Accurate Rate","This study uses five exchange rate models, UIP, PPP, MF, TR_s and TR_a , to examine the hedging accurate rate and performance on the TWD/USD exchange rate. The empirical results show that in any length of hedging terms, the hedging accurate rates of macro fundamental models are higher than those of hedging rules from the past researches. However, the high hedging accurate rate of the model does not imply it has good forecasting ability because it cannot forecast the magnitude of exchange rate movements precisely. Our results also show that monetary fundamental model (MF) and the asymmetric Taylor rule (TR_a) outperform the other competing models in six-month out-of-sample hedging. Comparing the hedging performance between MF and a TR models, we find that the hedging performance by the MF and a TR with exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) hedge ratio will get the same return.

The proposed method is a two stage non-parametric estimation method which can efficiently measure the extreme dependence of the conditional distribution of the heteroscedastic returns series and minimize estimation bias. Firstly the empirical analysis demonstrates that when negative shocks occur there are high level market co-movements or interdependence between US and Asian, Latin American and European stock markets, but there are no tail dependence. When positive shocks occur there are tail dependence between US and European larger stock markets such as Britain, Germany and France. Secondly the left and right tail dependence function of return distribution between the US and international stock markets are not different, but rolling sample estimation finds the left and right tail dependence time-varying. Thirdly countries geographically near US have high left and right tail dependence with US. Finally we find that the impacts of financial crisis on dependence and contagion pattern vary across different financial crises. In particular, the US subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 triggered the financial tsunami and the European debt crisis, and spillover its effects on market, credit, and liquidity risks, from local financial market to the global financial markets.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201606-201608030005-201608030005-83-136,99.0,2016,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

We collected data on the personality traits, job rotation, and tenure of extension managers and examined the proportion of fixed assets being utilized in extension departments. We adopted the metafrontier model based on output distance function to evaluate the technical efficiencies of 192 extension departments of Taiwan's farmers' associations over the period of 2009-2011. Empirical findings were as follows: Firstly, it is shown that some of the manager personality traits are significantly related to the technical inefficiency of extension departments. Besides, managers with more often job rotation experiences prior to get the manager position, or with less job rotations after becoming the manager, would help to upgrade the performances of extension departments. Secondly, the average meta-technical efficiency for the whole sample is 0.6007, in which the average efficiency score of rural farmers' associations was significantly higher than those of urban and mixed-type farmers' associations. With a mean of 0.7458, the technology gap ratio of rural farmers' associations was significantly higher than that of urban farmers' associations. Furthermore, both of the meta-technical efficiency and technology gap ratio have deteriorated gradually. Lastly, for the inefficient farmers' associations, increase their outputs, in particular the revenues from projects, would benefit to enhance the efficiencies of the extension departments.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201606-201608030005-201608030005-177-222,99.0,2016,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

In addition to direct spillovers, we also take into account indirect spillovers from the seven R&D countries while examining the impact of international spillovers on the productivity growth and industrial competitiveness of the OECD countries. The sample countries are divided into two subgroups including major R&D countries and rest-of-OECD countries. Empirical results indicate a statistically positive effect of direct spillovers on major R&D countries' productivity growth and industrial competitiveness. For the group of rest-of-OECD countries, indirect spillovers are found to be a driver for productivity growth but in the mean-time a crucial factor that can dampen industrial competitiveness. However, when taking into account the indirect effect that indirect spillovers work through productivity growth, the results suggest indirect spillovers can generate positive effect on industrial competitiveness for the rest-of-OECD countries. Therefore, it is important to incorporate the notion of indirect spillovers explicitly into modeling the impact of international spillovers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201606-201608030005-201608030005-223-269,99.0,2016,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

On the issue of fairness, we explore how individual backgrounds affect students' probability to select one of three different admission channels to enter college. The results indicate that father's education level and family income do not play significant roles and few specific parents' occupations are influential. Multi-Channel Admission System in Taiwan does not translate into the so-called ＂money-oriented＂ Admission System as the public believe. However, the information related to admission provided by higher-educated mothers or private high schools increase student's opportunity to enter colleges through the ＂recommendation＂ or the ＂application＂ channels. On the other hand, the efficiency analysis is based on students' satisfaction levels on their colleges, fields of study, and their own learning performance. Empirical results show that students via ＂examination＂ tend to have the lowest satisfaction level, while students via ＂application＂ have higher satisfaction level than those via ＂recommendation＂.

Employing the TAIBOR and CP2 interest rates of Taiwan, the magnitude of slope coefficients in the regressions of short rate changes on long-short spreads cannot support the expectation hypothesis of term structure of interest rates for different maturity of interest rates. Considering the effect of monetary policy on the results of tests of expectation hypothesis of term structure of interest rates emphasized by Mankiw and Miron (1986), this research employs the model of McCallum (1994, 2005) and Kugler (1997) to study the role of monetary policy on the term structure of interest rates. The analysis indicates the anomalous empirical findings can be rationalized with the expectation theory by recognition of an autoregressive term premium and the monetary policy with smoothing short rate changes. Furthermore, the premia persistence rises with longer rate maturity, whereas the influence of the according spreads in the monetary policy reaction function diminishes. Employing the VECM model of McCallum (1994, 2005) and Kugler (1997) developed by Weber and Wolters (2012) and the regime dependent model of Kugler (1997) extended by this research, the inference of the empirical results can still hold.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201512-201602150004-201602150004-55-100,98.0,2015,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Prior studies suggested that the full year ranking results from the IDTRS had significant positive effects on institutional investors but were unable to identify whether changes in ranking results from the IDTRS affect stock-based compensation. This study therefore aims to examine this question. Based on the sampled ranking results of information disclosure by the companies listed on TWSE between 2006 and 2012, the initial findings reveal that ranking levels are directly proportional to rates of return on portfolios over a one year holding period. Upgraded or downgraded ranking compared with the previous year are defined as good or bad news to see whether rates of return on portfolios are positive at the end of the one year holding period. The results show that they are indeed positive, indicating that announcing ranking results of information disclosure in Taiwan stock market produces an information content effect and investors react differently to the good/bad news in the announced results.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201512-201602150004-201602150004-113-148,98.0,2015,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Analysis on Inhabitation Stability with Influence from Housing Variation,Chich-Ping Hu,"House, Family Need, Heterogeneity, Housing Canonical Factor, Housing Variation","A suitable house for individuals is the most important object to accomplish with one's efforts. Owning a comfortable house for a family should always consider to meet between living space demand and family need. Households will not often relocate for the reason that living is stable associated with the housing properties of immobility, heterogeneity, high using cost, and environmental quality need only if inevitable requirements take place. But for the disadvantaged families will always be forced to sacrifice stable residence situation to be survived due to considerable living burden and supportive financial lack. This research defines the covariate between household attributes and dwelling attributes as housing canonical factor playing the role to affect the decision of inhabitation stability. For the interpretation of influenced property and level on inhabitation stability from housing canonical factor and relative variables, this research applies two stage estimation to establish investigative model. In the first stage, the canonical correlation analysis method is used to find the covariate between household attributes and dwelling attributes as the input for the calculation of housing canonical factor score with statistical significance test by official data in Taiwan area. Housing variation can be derived for absolute value of the gap between two standardized housing canonical factors selected for the calculation of factor scores by canonical equations. In the second stage, the Binary Logit model is then used to investigate the affected properties and level on inhabitation stability from housing variation, couple's covariates, and government subsidy policy. The result shows that inhabitation stability is negatively affected by other couple's covariates, housing variation, and government subsidy only if it is positively affected by couple's ages gap.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201512-201602150004-201602150004-149-180,98.0,2015,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

We develop a theoretical model to predict that unconditional transfers reduce local fiscal efforts; meanwhile, the impacts of conditional transfers on fiscal efforts are decided by two opposite effects, and, therefore, are ambiguous. Using the panel dataset of Taiwanese 23 local governments for the period 2001-2010, we found that there exist significant differences of fiscal efforts in collecting own-source revenues of local governments. The results show that both conditional and unconditional transfers restrain fiscal efforts.

This has caused an increase in total labor costs, which may in turn cause a decrease in capital investments-a topic that has become an important policy issue. This research therefore uses data from Taiwanese stock market companies over the period from 2002 to 2012 in order to analyze the effect of mandated benefits on capital investments. To control for a bias possibly caused by unmeasurable heterogeneity, we employ a panel data fixed effect model. Moreover, we control for the endogeneity between mandated benefits and wages as well as for the traditional determinants of capital investments based on accelerator model, cash flow model, neoclassical model and Tobin's Q. According to our empirical research results, an increase in the mandated benefit ratio causes a reduction in company capital investments.

The purpose is to find the consequences of ＂financialization＂ of the oil market, especially after oil prices exhibited roller-coaster dynamics in recent years. The major conclusions are: (1) A structural break exists during the sample period from 2000/01/04 to 2012/03/27 and oil dynamics can be divided into two distinct periods constituting quite different investment environments. (2) The first period is characterized as a ＂high return, low risk＂ period, while the second is a ＂low return, high risk＂ state. The breakpoint is supported by existing literature which claims that huge flows of index-funds have change the oil market generating increasingly large trading volumes. (3) In the first period, oil price is basically driven by agent behavior. Fundamentalists play a crucial role in market stabilization. Price follows closely to its long-run equilibrium level. (4) In the second period, financial market conditions appear to explain oil price fluctuations. Fundamentalists lose confidence and stop trading when price deviations increase. Chartists' chase-and-sell strategies cause a wider range of surge and slump.

The Impact of Weather Changes on the Chinese Political Regime: A Viewpoint from the Weak Prime Minister,Tay-Cheng Ma,"Statism, Individualism, Democracy, National Defense, Taming The River","This article uses a dataset covering the period from 220 B.C. to 1839 A.D. to investigate how natural environment influences political regimes through the channels of building Great Wall (national defense) and taming the Yellow River. The results obtained show that the presence of the autocratic monarch (or the weak prime minister) was caused by changes in weather patterns starting from the Song dynasty when the Chinese weather began to enter the Little Ice Age. The colder and extreme weather conditions worsened the living environment of northern nomadic people as well as increased the sediment concentration of the Yellow River. The former would, in turn, cause frequent Sino-nomadic conflicts, while the latter would increase the risk of the bank-breaching of the Yellow River. To address these two challenges, the Chinese political regime had to evolve toward a more autocratic and centralized state so as to ensure that limited resources were efficiently directed to prevent the nomadic invasions and the flood of the Yellow River. This kind of change in political regime in response to weather conditions is fully compatible with the law of evolution proposed by the neo-institutional school.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201506-201507310027-201507310027-211-259,97.0,2015,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Incumbent Support: Data Analysis Using Bayesian Multilevel Models,Chia-Hung Tsai,"Mayor Election, Government Performance, Voting Behavior, Bayesian Multilevel Model","Democratic governments should seek for the best interest for citizens. In theory, incumbents should persuade voters to support them again with their performance, including budget distribution. It is important to evaluate the extent to which voters respond to government performance and re-elect the incumbents. This paper uses data from Taiwan's Election and Democratization Studies (TEDS 2010C) and set up five clusters of respondents according to their residence in five counties or cities. Utilizing multi-level Bayesian analysis, I combine aggregate-level budget data of social welfare, transportation, and environmental protection, and corresponding survey data to test the hypothesis of individual and geographical influence on voting behavior. The results show that individual's policy evaluation significantly influences voting behavior, while partisanship is taken into account. But government spending seems to have no impact on the probability of supporting the incumbents.

The Neutrality of Profit Tax and the Optimal Privatization Policy in the Mixed Oligopoly,"K. L. Glen Ueng, Wan-Yi Lin, Horn-In Kuo","Profit Tax, Public Enterprise, Privatization, Mixed Oligopoly","The traditional literature regarding privatization of public enterprises under mixed oligopolies has neglected the impact of taxes. Therefore, this paper takes the effect of taxation into account and explores the optimal degree of privatization on public enterprises. It shows that, because profit taxes are non-neutral for the privatized firm, both the market equilibrium and the privatization policy will be affected by the imposition of profit taxes. Moreover, the optimal degree of privatization will increase (decrease) as tax rate increases (decreases), regardless of the number of domestic or foreign firms in the market. In other words, neglecting the impact of taxes will underestimate the optimal degree of privatization for public enterprises.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201412-201502060006-201502060006-105-126,96.0,2014,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Does Technological Catch-up of Economic Production Exist among Taiwan's Cities and Counties?,Chih-Cheng Chen,"Technical Efficiency, Technological Catch-up, Meta-DEA, Malmquist Index","The purpose of this study is focusing on whether the heterogeneity and catch-up of economic production technology exist between Taiwan's service-typed and nonservice-typed cities and counties. We firstly apply the meta-DEA to investigate the heterogeneity of economic production technology between these two groups and then discuss their technology catch-up by de-compositing the Malmquist productivity index from 2001-2010. Our estimated results show that the production efficiencies of cities and counties in nonservice-typed group significantly lower than the ones in service-typed group, which indicates that the economic production technology heterogeneity exists between the nonservice-typed and service-typed cities and counties and also reflects the distance between urban and rural areas. Besides, the higher Malmquist productivity indexes from 2001-2010 of the cities and counties in nonservice-typed group than the service-typed ones also show that the former group contribute more to Taiwan's total factor productivity. In addition, the cities and counties in southern Taiwan caught up obviously and Tainan city is the one which caught up most actively. Finally, the average catch-up indexes are smaller than 1 in 2001-2010 also means that the distance between urban and rural areas has been shortening gradually.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201412-201502060006-201502060006-127-189,96.0,2014,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Using Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) options data from 2002 to 2007, this study shows that people's propensity to gamble and their investment decisions are correlated. At an aggregate level, individual investors relative to institutional investors prefer options with lottery features. Using five methods that Kumar(2009) proposed to capture an investor's preference for lottery-type TAIEX options, the results demonstrate that some socioeconomic factors induce greater investment in lottery-type TAIEX options.

The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) in Taiwan chooses the GDP growth rate based on the expenditure side, yet this choice implies that the information in the production side are completely ignored. This paper applies the Kalman filter to estimate the underlying true GDP growth rate and find that the GDP growth rate from the production side tracks the true GDP growth rate better. In order to approximate shares of the underlying true GDP growth rate contributed from the production and expenditure sides, we also apply the combinded forecast theory to obtain optimal weights. Finally, Mincer-Zarnowitz test reveals that both the preliminary and annual revised GDP growth rates released by the DGBAS are able to rationally forecast the true GDP growth rate.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201406-201408050015-201408050015-1-33,95.0,2014,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Assuming that both the licensor and licensee engage in a quantitative competition in the same industry after licensing, we obtain the following results. First, the less competitive a market with a non-drastic innovation, the more likely the licensor would prefer a fixed-fee licensing to a royalty licensing. Second, considering the magnitude of competition between firms, the optimal royalty rate could be smaller than the cost reduction after licensing when the licensor is responsible for selecting a royalty licensing regime.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201406-201408050015-201408050015-35-59,95.0,2014,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Factors of the Herding Behavior and Macro Economy on the Residential Real Estate Markets,"Calvin Tso-Yu Lin, Yu-Fang Cheng","Real Estate Market, Herding, Transaction Volatility, ARDL Model","The traditional financial theory assumes that the market is efficient, however, the real estate market is less efficient than the security market. Due to the lack of transparent information, home buyers can not react to market information rationally. They may choose to follow other peoples' decisions and lead to the herding behavior and price volatility or unusual transactions. Most previous studies employed the return and its deviation as the measurement of the herding behavior, however, the trading volume volatility is the indicator of herding behavior prior to return. This study thus intends to examine the trading volume in the residential real estate market to observe the herding behavior in Taiwan. Results show that the herding behavior of residential real estate market exists in Taipei City. In contrast, the effect on Taichung and Kaohsiung is not significant. Factors attributing to the different results may include the industry concentration, employment opportunity and the relative scarcity of housing supply in various regions. We also find that the transactions of herding behavior in the residential real estate market may be affected by user cost of housing and previous market returns. Furthermore, some macroeconomic factors (i.e., economic growth rate, construction stocks index, change of housing rents and construction costs) impose positive impact on the housing transactions. On the contrary, mortgage interest rates and consumer price index have negative influence. This paper is the first study focusing the trading volume in the real estate market for the herding behavior in Taiwan.

The Market States and the Relationship between Option Trade Activity and Stock Prices in Taiwan,Wen-Hsiu Kuo,"Market State, Stock Index Option, Trading Imbalance, Trader Types, Price Impact","The paper examines the impacts of option trading for future stock price movements at the aggregate market and trader levels with and without conditioning on market states using the non-publicly unique Taiwan stock index option data. First, we find that option trading imbalances by the aggregate market and individual investors tend to move stock prices in the opposite direction of the trades without conditioning on market states and at the flat market, but move stock prices in the direction of trades at the bull and bear markets. Second, the option trading imbalances by institutional and foreign investors move stock prices in the direction of trades without conditioning on market states and at the bull and bear markets, but have no significant price impacts at the flat market. Further evidence shows that the price impacts by institutional and foreign investors are much more apparent at the bear market. Overall, these findings show that the market states seem to play a substantial role in the relation between option trading and stock returns. Specially, this accurate evidence on return predictability is more pronounced at the bull and bear markets, implying that positive (negative) stock index option trades increase and then the stock returns of the simultaneous day and next day increase (decrease) significantly. These results support that the current market condition hypothesis by Chiyachantana et al.

The Abatement Costs of CO_2 Emission in the Industrial Sectors in Taiwan-The Environment Directional Distance Function Approach,"Jenn-Shyong Kauo, Shine-May Chen, Kuang-Ta Lo","Pollution Abatement Costs, Eco-efficiency, Environmental Directional Distance Functions, Data Envelopment Analysis","The computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is typically used to estimate the economic costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in previous studies. However, the CGE model is subject to the specified parameters, and it usually focuses on macro-level estimation. From the eco-efficiency perspective, a firm that can reduce energy use and carbon dioxide (CO_2) emissions but also increase the desired output can contribute to both economic growth and environmental protection. Thus, unlike previous works, this study uses the environment directional distance function so that firms can increase good outputs and reduce bad outputs simultaneously. The estimated impacts and abatement costs of CO_2 emissions in Taiwan are based on 2005-2011 data for 365 firms in 14 industries. The empirical results confirm that eco-efficiency can be substantially improved if the government executes compulsory policies or a firm voluntarily controls its CO_2 emissions. In addition, no matter the strong or weak disposability assumption is applied in the estimation, cement manufacturing is an ecologically inefficient industry. Thus, stopping domestic production is one option, but it may cause the carbon leakage and also influence domestic industries severely. Therefore, seeking new technologies to reduce pollution may be a pragmatic alternative. Finally, holding firms responsible for emissions reductions can indeed improve eco-efficiency but the excessive opportunity cost is a problem that cannot be ignored.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201406-201408050015-201408050015-147-189,95.0,2014,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
The Affecting Factors on Landlords' Willingness and Compensation Claims to Participate in the Voluntary Afforestation Payment Agreements-A Case of Fallow in Tainan,"Wan-Yu Liu, Kuo-Ching Lin, Ying-Yen Shih","Private Landowners, Participation Incentives, Willingness to Accept, Environmental Payment Agreement, Afforestation Payment Agreements","Conventionally, it is easier to execute the afforestation payment agreement in which the payments are fixed and depend on the afforestation area size. However, the payments are unfair due to differences of land locations, geographical environment, climate condition, landscape benefit, and so on. In addition, it also leads to that the private landowners with priority for afforestation are not willing to participate in afforestation, further decreasing the benefits of policy execution. The advanced countries (such as USA, Finland, etc.) have started thinking over market-orient auction payment agreements to reward afforestation. Aside from decreasing the budget cost of the government, such a voluntary afforestation payment agreement can achieve the goal of making flexible payments with respect to different area locations, and raise the policy benefit and environmental benefit. In this study, we investigate the factors of affecting landowners' intention to sign the agreement contact and the amount of willingness to be rewarded, if the Taiwan government applies the voluntary afforestation payment agreement. This study surveyed 300 private landowners in Tainan, and conducted the Heckman two-step estimation method on the surveyed data. The analysis results show that female landowners, elder landowners, and those with more family members pay more attention to their attitude and cognition toward the environment; the landowners that pay more attention to the contract duration, the contract payment amount, as well as the contracted tree species have higher willingness to apply for the afforestation agreement. The landowners with larger-size farmland and those with land farther away from urban districts would like higher willingness to accept. In addition, female and highly-educated landowners have lower willingness to accept. Since highly-educated landowners have stronger reception and preferences for environmental value, they request a smaller payment amount. The analysis results also show that the landowners that emphasize environmental value are willing to accept the payment amount lower than the standard amount, showing that the voluntary afforestation payment agreement has more cost effectiveness than conventional uniform pricing programs or top-down policies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201406-201408050015-201408050015-191-224,95.0,2014,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The empirical results show: First, the effect of economic forecasting announcements from different research institutions is indifference from research institutions. Only the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research induces more abnormal returns. Second, optimistic economic forecasting induces 45% positive abnormal return and pessimistic economic forecasting induces 52% negative abnormal return. However, 82% event-induced volatility decline whether optimistic or pessimistic economic forecasting announced. Third, the return of electronic industrial index is more likely influenced by economic forecasting events than other industrial indices.

Environmental Taxes and Global Sourcing,"Chelsea C.

The final good is developed in the North, and the intermediate polluting input can be produced in the North as standard vertical integration, produced in the South as FDI, outsourced from the North or outsourced from the South. The production of intermediate polluting input will be charged an environ-mental tax. When the environmental tax is higher in the North, the final good producer's sourcing choices mainly depend on the contract cost. When the contract cost is high, the North final good producer tends to keep the production of the intermediate input within its boundary as standard vertical integration or FDI. The location of production is influenced by the environ-mental tax. In contrast to the pollution haven hypothesis, we find that the North final good producer would produce in the South (North) when the environmental tax is relatively low (high). Moreover, our results show that the North final good producer would be more likely to outsource when the international difference in the environmental policies is relatively high.

There is a consensus that the developed and developing countries have to work together to solve the problem. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is one of the flexibility mechanisms defined in the Kyoto Protocol, and it allows the developed countries, in cooperation with developing countries, to fulfill the emission-reduction targets. However, the emissions abatement effects of CDM in the literatures are diverse. Accordingly, this paper uses 20 developed countries and 16 developing countries as an empirical case to examine the impact of CDM on carbon dioxide emissions abatement from 2003 to 2008. According to the fixed effects and two-stage least squares model, CDM projects did reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of developing countries, but the certified emissions reductions (CERs) were excessively issued.

This study made use of structural equation modeling (SEM) to develop a partnership model based on an integration of key mediating variables (KMV) and the collaborative interest model (CIM) with an eye to facilitating effective contractual arrangements and cooperation between farmers and firms. The proposed model allows for exploration into the interactions among relationship quality (involving commitment and trust), relationship performance (effectiveness and efficiency), and relationship perceptions of cost and risk, competitive positioning, and critical resources. We then applied the proposed model to a particular case study, the empirical results of which indicate the following: both perceived costs and perceived risk have a negative impact on commitment, while competitive positioning has a positive impact. Critical resources however have no significant effect on commitment. Strong commitment in turn has a positive impact on trust. Finally, trust has a positive impact on relationship effectiveness and relationship efficiency. In terms of the efficacy of rival models, we found that relationship quality plays an important intermediary role in the efficacy of various partnership models.

A bivariate probit model was estimated to capture the unobserved heterogeneity between obesity and chronic diseases. Results show that obesity is positively associated with the likelihood of having chronic diseases.

Taking structural changes in consideration, the three interest rates mentioned above all follow an I(1) process and possess cointegration relationships. By employing Gonzalo and Granger (1995) permanent-transitory model, Hasbrouck (1995) information share model and variance decomposition and impulse response analysis of King et al. (1991), the empirical results show the price discovery role of interest rate of interbank call-loan market is greater than that of TAIBOR and the relative importance on the process of price discovery of TAIBOR is significant than that of secondary money market rate on commercial paper. Overall, the interest rate of interbank call-loan market can be served as the primary indicator of short term interest of Taiwan and this is related with the focusing on the overnight interest rate rather than the amount of money supply as the primary indicator of the stance of monetary policy of Taiwan central bank.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201212-201302070039-201302070039-23-58,92.0,2012,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
The Effect of Prior Audit Experience on Subsequent Tax Noncompliance,"Mei-Juh Huang, Su-Ming Lin, Wen-Hsin Huang","Prior Audit Experience, Tax Noncompliance","Whether or not the tax audits by tax authorities have significant deterrent effect on subsequent tax noncompliance, prior studies did not have a consistent conclusion. This study provides further evidence that the variation in responses to tax audits among taxpayers is determined by the aggressiveness of prior reporting. This study uses Taiwan's business income tax returns data of year 2000 and 2002 to investigate the effect of prior (year 2000) audit experience, including the previous level of noncompliance and the associated penalties, on subsequent (year 2002) tax noncompliance. The empirical results show that entrenched tax evaders are not deterred by prior audit experiences, while moderate or small tax evaders appeared to be more deterred by prior audits. In short, our evidence suggests that the audit policy in Taiwan generate deterrence to moderate tax evaders and honest taxpayers. This result is consistent with the results of Long and Schwartz (1987) and Bergman and Nevarez (2006).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201212-201302070039-201302070039-59-91,92.0,2012,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Uncertain Lodging Demand and Hotel Costs: An Empirical Study of International Tourist Hotels in Taiwan,"Chia-Yu Yeh, Chiang-Ming Chen","Uncertain Demand, Cost Function, Hotel Industry, Occupancy Rate","One fundamental and awkward issue for hotel management is to face and deal with the highly fluctuate and uncertain demand for lodging service. Previous studies related to analyze hotel industries often ignore this issue. Therefore, this study develops a cost function with concern of demand uncertainty by investigating the annual financial statement data from Taiwan's international tourist hotels, published by Taiwan Tourism Bureau over the period of 1998-2007. Our results show that the uncertainty in hotel room demand has a significant and positive impact on the hotel costs. The model also predicts that the decrease of the occupancy rate by 1% will increase the average cost of a hotel by NTD$1,563,304 annually.

The empirical results verify that the FIEC-HYGARCH model can be used to capture the effects of long memory. The rate of returns of TFT-LCD upper, middle, and down stream stock price indexes have their own-and cross-market mean spillover effects. These findings imply that the TFT-LCD panel market for each industry is not efficient in the sense that the rate of returns of the indexes for these industries could be predicted by using past information for the investors.

The evidence shows that there are different effects of oil prices volatility on product prices across individual industries, owing to technical levels, distinct capital scales, and various dependences for crude oil. As the oil price has increased, the production costs of the petroleum chemical industry, resin industry, and synthetic fiber industry have a huge amount of increases, but the impacts apparently drop off because of change in technical level and industrial structures. Furthermore, the ability of bringing down inflation in Taiwan has lifted after the oil crisis. It follows the lower impacts of increases in oil price on price levels (consumer price index, producer price index, and corporate goods price index). In addition, the price elasticity of import gradually decreases due to change in the input technical level of imported goods and production structural adjustment. Moreover, the function of input technical changes in imported goods brings down inflation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201212-201302070039-201302070039-163-197,92.0,2012,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

This paper simultaneously combines and extends Lins et al. (2003) and Fried et al. (2002) to compute environmental and statistical noise-adjusted efficiency under zero-sum gains (ZSG) via output slack adjustments. A panel dataset of securities firms in Taiwan from pre-FHC periods during 2001 (139 firms)-2003 (110 firms) to post-FHC during 2004 (103 firms)-2006 (92 firms) is used for empirical study. Empirical findings confirm that a continuous stream of foreign-affiliated securities firms offer better practice than domestic ones. Small and specialized domestic brokerage firms are relatively efficient and hence should not be legally prohibited from being subsidiaries of financial holding companies in Taiwan.

At the end, the operational performance management matrix is used to study hotels' existing competitiveness and potentials of long-run development.Several results are obtained. DEA analysis indicates that within the sample periods, on average, the pure technical efficiency was 91.47%. Regression analysis shows that GDP, local government economic service expenditures, and market concentration were positively related to overall technical efficiency, while the chain system hotels did not perform better than others. TFPC increased by 1.56% annually, which could mainly be attributed to the improvements in technical change (1.43%) and in pure technical efficiency change (0.2%). As for scale efficiency and output mix effect, the change indexes were stable around unity.

Production phases are explicitly divided into two activities, namely, breed-to-farrow phase and wean-to-finish phase. By using this model, the problem of shared inputs and dynamic intermediates among activities which characterize pig production are taken into account in an integrated framework simultaneously with the consideration of all the potential slacks, and allow us to examine aspects of production in a more comprehensive and factual manner. For the empirical results based on sample data from 2005～2007, it is shown that the overall technical inefficiencies obtained from MNDEA do not reveal obvious difference from those from a traditional one-stage model. However, the MNDEA results show us explicitly that the inefficiency sources for each farm are different. Furthermore, regression results also tell us that the determinants of efficiency for each production phase are not completely the same, and indicate the need to identify the influential factors for each production phase separately.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201209-201211090027-201211090027-111-154,2012.0,2012,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

This study utilizes the metafrontier DEA model embedded into a stochastic production frontier model to consider the different characteristics of education quality and operational styles. In doing so, we can estimate the technology efficiency and technology gap ratio in different types of technology universities and colleges. Subsequently, we apply the generalized metafrontier Malmquist productivity index for separating the productivity index and exploring the technology efficiency change for the different types of technology universities and colleges. The empirical finding shows that the technology efficiency and technology gap ratio of technology universities are significantly higher than that of technology colleges. Through the above-mentioned procedures, we find that the national universities of technology possess a high technology level, but technology colleges need to improve their educational quality and adjust their factor inputs. Regarding the productivity index, we find that the average productivity growth of technology universities has increased to about 5.65 percent and that of technology colleges has decreased to about 10.72 percent. In addition, the primary growth factors of technology universities are due to scale change efficiency. However, this is not the case with technology colleges.

Adopting the sample data of Taiwan electronic industry from 2005-2009, we select 54 financially shaky firms and 108 normal ones as match firms in the empirical implementation. The empirical analysis proceeds in three stages. First, we use KMV model to estimate the EDF of sample companies and then we estimate over-efficiency, technical efficiency and scale efficiency by means of three-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA). Finally, we incorporate the financial variables, EDF and operating efficiency variables into logit regression model to establish a credit risk evaluation model. Experimental results indicate that the efficiency measured by one-stage DEA obviously differs from the one measured by three-stage DEA. Furthermore, there exists differences between shaky firms and normal ones when applied to the financial variables, EDF, and three-stage DEA efficiency variables. In the results of logit regression, we find that the EDF and operating variables have significant explanatory power in one year prior to the financial crises of sample firms. Moreover, the predictive results indicates that the models used financial variables with EDF or financial variables with three-stage DEA efficiency variables are more correct than the model used only financial variables.

A Study on the Effect of Price Uncertainty and Carbon Payment Schemes on Landowners' Land Use Decisions-A Case of Cunnignhania lancelata,"Kuo-Ching Lin, Wan-Yu Liu","Price Uncertainty, Carbon Payment, Optimal Forest Rotation, Land Use Decision","This study analyzes the impacts of carbon payment mechanisms on landowners' land use decisions under timber price uncertainty. The carbon payment policies (or carbon subsidies mechanisms) considered in this study consist of four regimes, such as the lump-sum regime, flows regime, stocks regime, and ex-post lump-sum regime. The possible options for foresters' land use decisions are as follows: maintaining forests, harvesting forests and then switching to farming, or harvesting and then reforesting again. Under different carbon payment regimes, at each period of time the land owners will make land use decision in order to maximize the present value of land. The important decision made by foresters is the timing of harvesting timber and after that whether to reforest it again. Main conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) When there exists timber price uncertainty, the farm income and the discount rate contribute the most in influencing landowners' land use decisions. As the farm income or discount rate decreases, the timber price interval for the ”maintaining forests” decision will become wider, i.e., the price upper bound for the ”switching to farming” decision will fall and the price lower bound for the ”harvesting and then reforesting” decision will increase. (2) No matter which carbon payment mechanism is implemented by the government, the timber price interval for the ”maintaining forests” decision will become wider. (3) Among the four carbon payment regimes, except for the second one, the other three carbon payment regimes implemented by the government will decrease the forest rotation length. That is, when landowners participate in forest carbon payment mechanisms or carbon subsidy policies, they may not always lengthen their forest rotation period. (4) If the government does not implement any carbon payment mechanisms, the timing for harvesting timber will be around the 32nd year. The land use decision options after the 32nd year will be determined by the level of timber price. If the limber price is higher than $5,100/m^3, then landowners will choose to reforest; otherwise, landowners will choose to switch to farming. (5) When landowners participate in the carbon payment policies, the amount of profits generated by the harvested timber will decrease. The amount of reduction will increase with the increases of carbon price level. In addition, the ratio of the carbon profits to the total profits will increase along with the increases of the carbon price level. Among four mechanisms, the ratio for the second mechanism is the lowest. (6) Under the same governmental budget constraints, the timber price interval for the ”maintaining forests” decision for the second mechanism is the widest. According to our analysis, when evaluated by policy effectiveness, among four mechanisms the second one is considered the best.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201206-201208160011-201208160011-61-114,91.0,2012,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Moreover, we also explore whether real per capita income stimulates real government spending. If the income elasticity of demand for government spending exceeds unity, then the Wagner's Law should be supported. Our main findings are as follows. First, we find substantive evidence in favour of the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship among the above variables. Second, the empirical results demonstrate that public deficits and government spending have a significantly positive relationship, which provides a strong support for the Buchanan-Wagner hypothesis. This means that high deficits produce higher levels of government spending.

Besides assessing the policy value of current RE development policy, this model also compares policy value and policy planning in the two scenarios, which will help the government to formulate and improve its renewable energy development policies. The analysis shows that RE development provides investment benefits when considering real options value.

The empirical results can be listed as following: First, there is evidence for the asymmetric cointegration relationships between crude oil prices and the oil consumption. Second, the crude oil prices have more power than the prices of domestic oil product to explain the behavior of oil consumption in Taiwan. Third, the asymmetric error correction models indicate that the long-run asymmetric effects of oil prices on the oil consumption exist. When the error correction terms leave above the long-run equilibrium, the adjustment speeds are faster than that below the long-run equilibrium. This means that the oil consumption responds faster when oil prices rise than fall.

Hence, the government's regulation is not only plausible but necessary. The supplementary measures of profit restraint to the LPG dealers and of territory limitation to final price implemented by government prevented serious damages for customers' interest. Since the deregulation of LPG market, the administration ignored the necessary of the supplementary measures. Illegal LPG bottling factories and distributors were emerged and led to undercutting behavior in the market. Then, the upstream and downstream industries continuously violated the Fair Trade Law. The most server punishment almost made the LPG industry become the large supporter of Fair Trade Commission. It can be found by reviewing the two regulating policies that due to the deficiency of proper supplementary measures government uses market mechanism to substitute the original control policy would cause many sequels for LPG market. For instances, security problems might be induced by the events that the LPG steel cylinders are not checked as scheduled, uncontrollable behavior of market trading induced by the emergence of illegal LPG bottling factories and distributors would directly or indirectly stimulate the happening of collusion.Furthermore, the administration also disregarded the importance of reeducation for the people who works in the related industries. The result refers to that when regulating with market mechanism many firms would not accommodate new rule easily and violate the Fair Trade Law frequently. The large amount of accumulated forfeit made deep impression for people. Gauging the two regulation systems of the LPG market, the social cost of the 'competitive mechanism' is relatively not cheaper than the 'uniform pricing'. Accordingly, there is the room to rethink the question that which mechanism is more adequate for managing the LPG industry from the viewpoint of public policy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201112-201205291001-201205291001-96-139,90.0,2011,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Economic Benefits of Enforcing the COOL Law in Taiwan-The Case of Estimating Willingness to Pay for Oyster and Oolong Tea,"Yu-De Ou, Wen-S. Chen, Ernest Kang Liu","Country-of-origin Labeling, Contingent Valuation Method, Premium, Food Safety, Oyster, Oolong Tea, Taiwan, China, Vietnam, Risk Perception","The main purpose of this paper is to investigate whether, under the country-of-origin labeling (COOL), Taiwanese consumers would prefer the domestically produced oyster and oolong tea than smuggled oyster from China or imported tea from China and Vietnam. Furthermore, we also attempt to analyze the differences in purchasing behavior between different genders and risk perceptions. Data source is based on a telephone survey sponsored by the Council of Agriculture in 2008; the targeted population included food shoppers aged over 20 and have indoor phones. Using a stratified systematic sampling method, a total sample of 1,028 interviews was collected. This survey was based on the contingent valuation method (CVM), and we used both close-ended and open-ended questions to elicit the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for foods produced in Taiwan vs. other countries of origin. Based on the close-ended question, we use the binary and multinomial logit models to estimate the price premiums for Taiwan oyster and oolong tea when all products were clearly with COOL. Furthermore, we also apply Tobit model to estimate the WTP from the open-ended questions. The econometric results show that people in Taiwan would pay considerable price premiums to avoid buying the smuggled oyster from China and oolong tea imported from China and Vietnam. The study also finds that females are more conscious of food safety problems than males because females are more willing to pay a higher price premium on domestic oyster and oolong tea. Besides, we also find that people in Taiwan who care more about food safety risk are willing to pay higher price premiums for domestic oyster and oolong tea in order to avoid buying these likely unsafe products from other countries. The study concludes that Taiwan government should vigorously enforce the COOL law because it would not only enhance the competitiveness of our agriculture but also could protect the right of consumers in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201112-201205291001-201205291001-140-184,90.0,2011,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

It focuses on an economy with risky investment projects that require two goods as inputs, only one of which is accepted by lenders as collateral. Results show that in a competitive credit market, low-risk entrepreneurs tend to choose contracts with a combination of more collateral and lower rates of interest. Under the circumstance that low-risk entrepreneurs face a binding collateral constraint, problems of inefficient resource allocation and over-borrowing arise. On the contrary, the optimal loan contract does not require any collateral in a monopolistic credit market. Although this does not result in production inefficiency, it is possible that high-risk entrepreneurs may not be financed, leading to a problem of under investment in the economy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201106-201109080009-201109080009-1-29,89.0,2011,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Assessing Damage by Typhoon in Taiwan-an Example of Vegetable Demand and Supply,"Sheng-Jang Sheu, Ching-Cheng Chang","Typhoon, Vegetable Demand, Vegetable Supply, Instrumental Variable","Taiwan has been hard hit by typhoons every year. In order to assess the damage caused by typhoon on the agriculture sector, we use leafy vegetable as an example. Particularly, we use the heavy rain fall which comes along with a typhoon as a negative shock on leafy vegetable production to identify the demand on the vegetable. Before the arrival of a typhoon, consumers usually expect that the future leafy vegetable price will rise. Thus, the information with regard to the arrival of a typhoon is used a positive shock on demand to identify the supply of leafy vegetable. Our empirical results show that the elasticity of demand on leafy vegetables is ranged from -0.30 to -0.31 in the first Taipei market and from -0.35 to -0.36 in the second Taipei market, while the supply is nearly a vertical line. The possible reason may be that the supply is fixed and inelastic in very short run. Besides, the impact of heavy rain on the price of leafy vegetable increases at beginning and falls after the second week and lasts around four weeks long. As the result, over the four-week period the consumer surplus decreases 48.73 million NT dollars and producer surplus increases 31.57 million NT dollars in the first Taipei market. The welfare loss after the heavy rain fall is 17.17 million NT dollars, but note that the increase in producer surplus is not completely acquired by farmers. Instead, middlemen and vegetable importers gain part of the surplus.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201106-201109080009-201109080009-31-62,89.0,2011,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

This major policy initiative includes encouraging teachers to pursue an advanced degree and in-service education. The central issue of this project is to investigate the relationship between traditional human capital measures of teacher characteristics and student achievements. Using newly released data from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS), which allows students to be linked to particular teachers and classes, we can precisely estimate the effect of teacher characteristics on student outcomes while controlling for students' family background. Based on different specifications, our empirical results show that traditional human capital measures have few robust associations with students' test scores. Regarding teacher behavior variables, we find that teachers spending more time on students and class preparation tend to be more effective. As a result, we argue that it is not very likely to identify the quality of a teacher simply based on the traditional human capital characteristics.

And those assumptions leading to the conclusion that all firms developing a new product independently have shortest time-to-market among all types of network. Past studies also assumed an alliance can be formed promptly and its new product developing work can be started right away. Usually many products comprise several heterogeneous modules, and the formation of alliance takes times so there have formation-delay in starting new product development. After taking into account those two factors, this paper wants to study whether all firms develop independently is still the network with shortest time-to-market among all types of network? This paper finds that without considering formation-delay of an alliance, when the technological difference of those two modules is large, on average, consortium is the network bringing product to market with fastest speed among all types of network.

Due to extensive slopeland damage in recent years, the government understood the importance of soil and water conservation and legislated, educated people, and reinforced prohibited illegal use of slopeland. However, the area of investigation and prosecution cases of slopeland illegally used which government reinforced is very different from the illegally used area of some empirical researches estimation, which means direct order controlling method has not deterred Taiwan's illegal slopeland development. The resource reservation could be managed by direct order controlling or economic incentive methods. This research discusses the motives and deterrence factors of people illegally cultivate slopeland, and set up an economic theory of people illegally cultivated slopeland.

The Dynamics Analysis and Simulation of the Macro Economic Behavior of Taiwan's Invigorating Economy Consumption Voucher,Wen-Chin Wei,"System Dynamics, Consumption Voucher, Multiplier Effect","Given the severe global economic downturn, countries are using a variety of possible economic policies to try to help their economies recover. This study adopts system dynamics from the dynamic perspective to investigate how Taiwan’s decision to issue time-limited consumption vouchers will influence macro economical behaviors. The simulation led to following primary results. First, in regard to the highest marginal propensity to consume (MPC=0.3) and the lowest substitution rate of consumption (SR=0.6741), the distribution of the consumption voucher will generate the biggest multiplier coefficient (0.6830) and Y (GDP). Second, as SR increases by 1%, the multiplier effect decreases by 0.44%. Third, the contribution percentages of consumption vouchers on the first, second, third, and the accumulated total of these three quarters of private consumption in 2009 ranged from 2.13-2.55, 0.25-0.30, 0.19-0.22, and 0.86-1.02 of a percentage, respectively. Meanwhile, the contribution percentage of consumption vouchers in the first, second, third and the accumulated total of these three quarters of GDP in 2009 ranged from 1.36-1.63, 0.15-0.18, 0.11-0.13, and 0.51-0.61 of a percentage, respectively. Fourth, when the government adopts a constant budget policy, the increased distribution of consumption vouchers will not deteriorate the economy even though the government expenditure-but not private investment-is squeezed out. Finally, when the government does not stick to the constant budget policy, the evidence indicates that the expansion of the distribution of consumption vouchers will not squeeze out government expenditures. The policy implication is that the distribution of consumption vouchers will yield a multiplier effect, which will further stimulate effective demand and contribute to Taiwan's depressing economy. The possible crowding-out effects resulting from the consumption vouchers can be ignored, suggesting that the consumption voucher policy may ultimately be accepted as an effective approach to stimulate the economy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201106-201109080009-201109080009-153-181,89.0,2011,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

Results for periods beginning 2000s strongly confirm findings by Bessembinder and Seguin (1993) of a significant positive relation between unexpected volume and volatility and a significant negative relation between expected open interest and volatility. We further find stronger impacts of extremely higher or lower unexpected volume for both two and extremely higher unexpected open interest for heating oil on the volatility since 2000s whereas smaller impacts are found prior to 2000s.

On the Cost-Benefit Analysis of Carbon Sequestration under Considering Opportunity Cost,"Jiunn-Cheng Lin, Wan-Yu Liu","Kyoto Protocol, Carbon Sequestration, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Opportunity Cost","In order to reduce the negative impact due to the climate change resulting from increasing greenhouse gases, many countries in the world have actively adopted various kinds of approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Among those the forest carbon sink/sequestration has been regarded as one of the strategies which can provide the lowest costs for the reduction of emissions. Since forests are increasingly recognized as playing a key role in reducing carbon dioxide, forest carbon sinks have been included in Kyoto protocol as one of the mechanisms in mitigating climate change. According to Kyoto Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4, the production of CO2 sequestration and emission due to the strategies, which includes increasing afforestation, reforestation, deforestation (ARD) and improving forest management, can be merged to the amount of national emissions reduction. Concerning the economics of a country, forest management is a good cost-effective strategy for carbon reduction. The aim of this paper is to assess the economic cost and benefit of carbon reduction under China Fir plantation at Lien-Hua-Chih. In this research, we found that profits from harvest of timber have not been taken into consideration as part of the opportunity costs of carbon sequestration in previous studies, which may have caused underestimation of the carbon sequestration cost of human-made forest plantations. Based on the results of empirical simulation conducted in this research, a 20-year-old China Fir plantation yields a carbon sequestration volume of 54.22 tons after the opportunity costs are taken into consideration. Each hectare yields a present value of benefit of NT$54,154.85 from carbon sequestration and NT$225,931.69 from timber harvest. And each hectare incurs an accumulated carbon sequestration cost of NT$226,808.69, and the unit carbon sequestration cost comes to NT$4,183.28/ton. After factoring in the opportunity costs of carbon sequestration, the average unit cost of carbon sequestration rises from NT$2,253.78 to NT$2,866.42. To be thorough, this research brought in three additional carbon release ratios to calculate the unit carbon sequestration cost. Results show that, under the configuration of dispersed price function, the per-ton cost of carbon sequestration falls between NT$362 and NT$3,279.25, and when configured under continuous price function, the per-ton carbon sequestration cost falls between NT$898.20 and NT$5,309.86. Estimates derived from this research are generally consistent to the carbon sequestration costs estimated in the previous studies published internationally.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201012-201103160006-201103160006-61-102,88.0,2010,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

The empirical results show that the major soybean exporters are price-takers while some of the import markets are characterized by imperfect competition. As the R&D-induced technical change in regard to soybean yields is incorporated into this empirical model, the empirical results show that both importers and exporters benefit from this improvement in yields.

Two volatility measures are used in this study: the banks' return on assets (ROA) volatility for a proxy of accounting-based volatility, and the stock return realized volatility for a proxy of market-based volatility. This paper adopts Wang's (2002) heteroscedastic stochastic frontier model to estimate banks' cost efficiency as well as the marginal effects of volatility measures on inefficiency effect. Our empirical results show that both ROA and stock return volatility significantly affect the level and variability of inefficiency effect. The results are consistent with the prediction that a lower efficiency and higher variations in efficiency are likely to occur with a higher volatility in ROA.

(2004) to explore the different impacts of the supervision policy on cost efficiency of Taiwanese and Japanese banks.
Our empirical results find that, after the differentiated supervision policy executed, raising capital adequacy standard or cutting non-performing loan ratio decreases the cost efficiency of both Taiwanese and Japanese banking. But for the dummy variable of the year differentiated supervision policy implemented, it increases cost inefficiency. The estimated metafrontier cost function shows that the average technology gap ratio of Taiwan's banking is higher than the one of Japan from 2004 to 2007. Overall, the performance of Taiwanese banking is better than the one of Japanese banking.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201009-201011230051-201011230051-145-189,87.0,2010,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Quasi-fixed Inputs and the Change of Productivity of Taiwanese International Tourist Hotels,"Yih-Ming Lin, Wei-Hsing Kong, Chin-Lun Chang","Malmquist TFP Index, Technological Change, Technical Efficiency Change","The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of quasi-fixed inputs, such as the number of guest room, on measurement of Malmquist TFP index of Taiwanese international tourist hotels from 2004-2007. The phenomenon of quasi-fixed input commonly exists in Hotel industry. We estimate the Malmquist TFP index of Taiwanese international tourist hotels by considering hotel guest room as quasi-fixed input. The results show that the Malmquist TFP index when the number of guest room is considered to be the quasi-fixed input, are significantly higher than the Malmquist TFP index when all inputs are considered to be variable. The change of productivity is not significant when all inputs are considered to be variable whearas the productivity is improving when the quasi-fixity is considered. We also find that the improvement of productivity results from the progress of technology, not the improvement of technical effcicency. If we do not consider the quasi-fixity, the productivity of international tourist hotels will be underestimated. Furthermore, the results indicate that the location, management style and the source of tourists are the main impacts which affect the technological change and productivity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201009-201011230051-201011230051-191-225,87.0,2010,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Using a Metafrontier Input Distance Function to Estimate Technical Efficiencies and Technology Gaps Ratio for a Huge Container Liner Shipping Firm of Taiwan,"Tai-Hsin Huang, Bao-Guang Chang","Container Liner Shipping, Metafrontier Input Distance Function, Technical Efficiency, Technology Gap Ratio, Metafrontier","This paper investigates a metafrontier input distance function model for 21 regular routes of a container shipping company in Taiwan, using quarterly data spanning from 2003:1 to 2007:4. Each regular route is divided into inbound and outbound making the total number of routes equaling to 42. The metafrontier model allows for the calculation of comparable technical efficiencies for routes of inbound and outbound operating under different technologies. We compute and compare the technology gap ratios and the technical efficiencies against the potential technology for routes of inbound and outbound. Evidence is found that routes of outbound outperform routes of inbound in terms of technical efficiency, technology gap ratio, and overall efficiency, and that both routes of inbound and outbound exhibit increasing returns to scale with the outbound closer to constant returns to scale. The company is suggested raising its loading for inbound shipping in order to largely lower its long-run average cost and to improve its technical efficiency.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-201009-201011230051-201011230051-227-265,87.0,2010,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

If the heterogeneous expectations is combined between marginal intervention and float type, an announcement of exchange rate target zones has the honeymoon effect and the trade-offs relationship between exchange rate volatility and the interest rate differential is also exist. However, if the heterogeneous expectations is combined between marginal intervention and realignment type, both the honeymoon effect and trade-offs relationship will not exist under the larger agents' realignment expectations weight or the exchange rate is close to the edges of the band.

Monetary Policy and Exchange Rate Pass-Through: The Case of Taiwan,"Jui-Chuan Chang, Ching-Chuan Tsong","Monetary policy, Exchange rate pass-through, Import prices","The issue of exchange rate pass-through has been discussed for a long time, but linking to the macroeconomic factors (such as monetary policy and inflation environment) has recently been concerned by one of the new open-economy macroeconomics literature. This paper attempts to investigate the pass-through of exchange rate into industry-level import prices, and to explore whether monetary policy is associated with exchange rate pass-through effects, using Taiwan monthly trading industries data. Methodologically, we first set up an empirical model by following the testable concepts of Bailliu and Fujii (2004) and Campa and Goldberg (2005). Contrary to vector autoregressive models and single-equation models utilizing least squares estimation in the literature, this paper adopts the generalized method of moments to estimate a dynamic panel data model and thereby conduct the hypothesis testing. The empirical results show that the exchange rate pass-through is incomplete in the short run while complete in the long run, in conformity with the literature. Moreover, the monetary policy does affect the degree of exchange rate pass-through in the short run, but such effects are decaying to zero over time. This implies that the monetary policy is operative in the short run but not in the long run if a policymaker undertakes a monetary policy to change the exchange rate and consequently other macroeconomic variables.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-200912-201005120036-201005120036-37-67,86.0,2009,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics
Using Conjoint Analysis to Evaluate the Certification System of Organic Products,"Chang-Ju Huang, Men-Hsuen Chiou","organic products, conjoint analysis, market share, certification system, traceability","Taiwan government has been aggressively requiring organic products' traceability records to be registered in a specific website instead of a paper-based traceability system. Besides, the government proposed to allow the use of organic labels for products with residual pesticide up to 5% of the safety level instead of non-residue. This study attempted to examine if these policies are expected by the consumers.
The conjoint analysis results indicate that online traceability registration has no appreciable advantage over paper-based registration in terms of market share. This study also discovered that the liberalization of the definition of organic produce to include ”5% of safety level” will actually decrease the market share of organic products.
The results show that among the four attributes for agricultural products, ”certification” has the highest degree of importance, followed by the approximately equal ”residual pesticide level” and ”traceability”, with ”price” being the lowest.
In various certification schemes, organic products have the highest level of utility, followed by TAP and GAP. Uncertified products rank the lowest. In traceability attributes, online registration has slightly higher utility than paper-based registration, with no traceability having the lowest level. In the detection of residual pesticide, ”none detected” has a much higher utility level than ”5% of safety level” and ”safety level.”",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=05469600-200912-201005120036-201005120036-69-94,86.0,2009,Taiwan Journal of Applied Economics

This implies that organizations with high DIS and low FM have better accountability, so they can obtain more donations. All of the characteristics have significantly association with DR. In specific control variables, the results show that expense variables and organization type have significant positive association with DR. On the contrary, revenue variables, age, and service price have significant negative association with DR.

The growth effect of the income tax rate and the fraction of public infrastructures in government tax revenues are depending on the relative magnitude of public infrastructures production externality. The impact of income tax rate is similar to Barro (1990), and Futagami et al. (1993). An increasing in the foreign interest rate is unfavorable to the domestic economic growth, while a rise in the fallow ratio has an ambiguous impact on the growth rate, which is depending on the effect of fallow ratio on the soil fertility. Moreover, we find that the effect of public infrastructures production externality is larger, economic growth rate will appear an increasing tendency after the policy announcement in the short run.

Although a few literature has continued to address the need for government intervention in the provision of income tax deductions, these literature still lack a rational reason for carrying out tax deductions.

In order to forecast the volatility of rate of change for exchange rate, this study applies stochastic volatility model, GARCH model, GARCH-M model, EGARCH model, TGARCH model and GJR-GARCH model to proceed this purpose. Comparing the forecasting performance of each model, we find that the VEC-TGARCH model is better to describe the relationship between the spot and forward exchange markets. The sample period is from January 2, 2001 to November 30, 2005.
Major conclusions of this study are shown as follows. Firstly, the result of the unit root test shows that the NTD/USD spot exchange rate and the NTD/USD forward exchange rate are non-stationary series and have the same integration order I (1). Secondly, by using Johansen co-integration test, the result find that there is a co-integration relationship between the spot and forward exchange markets. Thirdly, there are a volatility clustering phenomenon and an asymmetric effect in spot and forward exchange markets. Fourthly, while taking the return of the forward exchange rate and the trading volume into account, it decreases the volatility clustering effect and fits the model well. It means that the investors should consider the influences of the forward exchange rate and trading volume to make better investment decisions. Fifthly, there are reciprocal cause and effect relationships between spot and forward exchange markets and the reaction of the forward exchange market to the new news is much faster. Sixthly, referring to the single variable model, the performance of the stochastic volatility model is the best, the second comes to TGARCH model. However, when adding the forward exchange rate and trading volume, the forecasting performance become better.

In this study, we estimate the nested PIGLOG (NEP) model using the annual disappearance data of meat and aquatic products in Taiwan from 1962 to 2002. Four food items are considered in this study including fish, chicken, pork and beef. Incorporating factors such as structural changes, time trend and the property of ”closure under unit scaling,” our empirical results show that both the NEP and GAITL (generalized almost ideal translog) are preferred models according to the likelihood ratio test. Moreover, from the results of out-of-sample forecasting, the NEP model is the best since it is ranked number one and two in terms of trace and determinant, respectively. Therefore, based on in-sample nested tests and out-of-sample forecasting, the NEP is the best choice of functional forms to explain demand for meats and fish in Taiwan. Empirical results also show that the own-price elasticities of meats and fish are all negative, satisfying the law of demand; whereas the negative cross-price elasticities between chicken and beef imply they are complements, but others are substitutes. Expenditure elasticities of beef and chicken are elastic, indicating that as the expenditure on meats and fish increases by one percent in Taiwan, the percentage increase of beef and chicken demands will be more than unity.

THE IMPACT OF MINIMUM WAGE ON WAGE INEQUALITY IN TAIWAN: EVIDENCE FROM 2012-2019,"Fung-Mey Huang, Zi-Ting Shao","Minimum wage, Wage inequality, Kernel density estimation","During 2012-2019, minimum wages in Taiwan were raised annually and the wage inequality of the bottom half of the wage distribution decreased substantially. This study investigates the association between the raising of the minimum wage and the decrease in lower-tail wage inequality in Taiwan by using the data of the Manpower Utilization Survey of DGBAS (Taiwan). The wage inequality is measured as the difference between the log of the p^(th) percentile wage and the log of the 50^(th) percentile wage in the wage distribution. This study uses the cross-county variation in effective minimum wage to identify the impact of minimum wage on wage inequality. The results show that the raising of the minimum wage during 2012-2019 accounts for the entire drop in the 10^(th) percentile wage inequality.

REVISITING INCOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN COHORTS AND SOCIAL CLASSES IN TAIWAN: 1990-2020,"Yi-Chun Chang, Thung-Hong Lin, Chun-Yin Lee","Generation, Cohort, Class, APC model, Income inequality","Income inequality, especially the generational gap of income and ＂generational justice＂ has become a hot topic for the public in Taiwan. However, the determinants of income variety among cohorts are a mixture of economic cycle, life course, education, social class, etc. The mixture also includes multiple factors about time, that is, the age-period-cohort (APC) effects in demographic studies. Many longitudinal surveys are unable to investigate the generational gap because the interviewees are limited in the same birth cohort. By applying the APC model to long-term datasets pooled from different waves of surveys, we estimate the trends of income from different cohorts, age groups and periods in Taiwan. Second, we pooled the Survey of Family Income and Expenditure to estimate the generational difference of personal income between 1990 and 2020 in Taiwan. The empirical evidence demonstrated the same patterns of personal income differences: (1) in contrast with increasing return of graduate school, the income return of university is shrinking; meanwhile, the income differences among employers, the self-employed, skilled workers (new middle classes), and unskilled workers has been amplified in the past three decades. (2) the income gap between the baby boomers and millennials has continued and implies a persistent generational inequality.

However, few studies have investigated thoroughly the impact of this policy on the productivity performance of the Chinese securities industry. This paper attempts to evaluate the dynamic performance of Chinese securities firms in recent years. We also assess the impact of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect policy on productivity performance of different types of securities firms. A panel data set with 80 securities firms in 2009-2017 is used for empirical measurement. We find that the performance of Chinese securities firms has been strongly influenced by the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect policy. During the study period, policy has not only boosted the scale of stock market, but also resulted in better performance of securities firms. While the productivity change of Chinese securities industry can be mostly attributed to technical efficiency change, the operational technology of China securities industry has increased over time. Results also indicate that large, listed, or locating in Beijing-Shanghai-Shejen region securities firms are found to perform better in terms of technical progress than other securities firms in China.

The Impact of External Shocks on the Volatility of Stock Returns: New Evidence from Four Developed Countries,"Zixiong Xie, Shyh-Wei Chen, An-Chi Wu","COVID-19, Volatility, Fad, COVID-19","This paper re-investigates the influences of external shocks from history, e.g., the global financial crisis (GFC) or the coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), on the volatility of stock returns of four developed countries. To this end, we employ the unobserved component Markov switching heteroscedasticit model (UC-MS). A merit of the UC-MS model is that it allows us to evaluate the influence of external shocks on the permanent and transitory components of stock returns separately. The empirical results show that, in the US, Germany, France, and the UK, on average the duration of the high-volatility regime of the transitory component is short-lived and speedily reverts to the low-volatility regime. The UC-MS measure of volatility suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a transient fad, but also the fundamental cause. It impacts the volatility of stock returns in the transitory and permanent components at the same time. The high volatility of stock returns comes mostly from the transitory component of stock returns rather than the permanent component.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-202203-202204140012-202204140012-49-88,52.2,2022,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

In this paper, we incorporate realized variance measures into structural models for the two risk measures. Our estimation procedure is semiparametric and relies on using a class of consistent loss functions proposed by Fissler and Ziegel (2016). We develop an efficient and stable two-stage method to implement the estimations. We then compare performances of out-of-sample forecasts from the estimated structural models with some existing methods, including several recently proposed novel models. We demonstrate that the proposed structure models with realized variance measures overall deliver superior forecasts of ES and VaR for major stock indices than the considered existing methods. An analysis of model averaging further shows that aggregating information from different methods can improve performances of the forecasts, and information from models with realized variance measures is indispensable for generating a superior model averaging forecast.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-202203-202204140012-202204140012-89-140,52.2,2022,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF CONSUMER INFLATION EXPECTATIONS IN TAIWAN,Evan Weicheng Miao,"Inflation expectation, Inflation forecasting, Consumer surveys","We present an analysis of inflation expectations in Taiwan derived from the analysis of data from surveys of households. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to analyze Taiwan's consumer inflation expectations. The surveys are conducted by the Research Center for Taiwan Economic Development of National Central University (NCU) and by Cathay Financial Holdings (Cathay). We modify the seminal methods of Carlson and Parkin (1975) and Batchelor and Orr (1988) and quantify their qualitative survey data. We depart from the assumption of a constant just noticeable difference (j.n.d.), under which the determination of δ requires full sample information. Instead we calculate the time-varying value of δ based on all data available up to the time of interest. As a consequence, our quantitative inflation expectations constructed in this paper are ex ante, as opposed to the ex post inflation expectations in previous works. Two conclusions emerge. The first is that the quantified household inflation expectations derived from the NCU and from the Cathay survey data in both cases outperform two benchmark models-the Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and the random-walk mode-in forecasting the six-month-ahead inflation. In particular, the forecasting accuracy of the quantified data derived from the Cathay survey performs statistically significantly better than the benchmark models. Our second conclusion is that our inflation forecasts for one or two quarters ahead outperform the DGBAS counterparts published in their press releases for GDP preliminary estimates.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-202110-202111040017-202111040017-1-37,52.1,2021,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Whether this relationship differs between younger firms and older firms will also be studied. By applying panel quantile regression and using total factor productivity (TFP) as the measure of productivity, our empirical results show that R&D has positive effects on sales growth but negative effects on TFP growth, and both effects increase with quantiles. Moreover, the R&D effects are larger for younger firms than for older firms at all quantiles, and the difference increases between younger and older firms when the quantile rises. The results suggest that the R&D effects on firm growth will vary across different quantiles, and firm age does play a crucial role in the R&D effects.

Employing Taiwan's Manpower Utilization Survey data from 1999 to 2008, we test two hypotheses. The first one is to investigate whether the wage premium of workers with a degree of university or higher relative to that of non-university graduates decreased after the implementation of HEEP. The second hypotheses that we examine is whether there was a significant deterioration in wage differential between overeducated workers and their adequately educated counterparts after the HEEP was implemented. Using Heckman's two-stage estimation model as the baseline model, combining the difference-in-differences strategy with the ORU model and Verdugo-Verdugo model setup, we find evidence that Taiwan's Higher Education Expansion Policy has sharply and significantly deteriorated the wages of graduates of university or higher and overeducated workers in Taiwan's labor market.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-202103-202104130022-202104130022-1-48,51.2,2021,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

We find that in terms of employment choices, the moving cost of migrant workers and the number of family income earners have significant influences on whether people choose to be paid workers. In terms of wage estimates, the urban residents' rate of return to education is about 10%, approximately twice the migrant workers' 4.9%, which is contrary to the existing literature, indicating that the return rate of education of urban residents is seriously underestimated when ability heterogeneity is not controlled. However, the return rate of work experience of migrant workers is greater than that of urban residents. Using Oaxaca- Ransom-Cotton's wage differential decomposition method, we further find that about 80% of the wage differential between migrant workers and urban residents can be attributed to the difference in endowment between the two groups.

In this study, population aging and wage stagnation were included in the model to estimate premium bases and benefit payments, which were then used to calculate the balance of payment rates and intergenerational premium burdens of NHI. Given the general premium rate without the rate ceiling of 6% and an estimated scenario with moderate population projection and moderate negotiated budget growth, the current 4.69% premium rate of the NHI would rise to 12.28% in 2041, and the rate would be higher for people born in later years. To mitigate the negative effects of population aging and wage stagnation that disproportionately impose the financial burden of paying NHI premiums on younger generations and eliminate the intergenerational inequality in NHI, reforms are necessary that implement a revenue-payment-linked mechanism, adjust the premium bases, and accurately determine financial responsibilities.

The major purpose of this study is to establish the methodology and provide the baseline forecasting and related policy simulations of greenhouse gas emissions in Taiwan's agricultural sector.

Adopting the model of English et al. (2003) and Castelnuovo (2003) and based on the frame- work of forward-looking Taylor rules, the empirical results indicate that implementing monetary policy in a gradual fashion by the Central Bank of Taiwan is the cause of the lagged interest rate entering estimated monetary policy rules. Besides, the conclusion that the lagged interest rate in monetary policy rules represents inertia of monetary policy can also be confirmed by alternative specifications of interest rate smoothing and persistent shocks and by taking the role of financial variables in Taylor rules into account. Considering the impacts of the global financial crisis of 2007 on the issue investigated in this research, the inferences about the inertia of monetary policy of Taiwan can still hold.

THE ZERO INTEREST RATE POLICY IN THE OVERLAPPING GENERATIONS MODEL,"Chi-Ting Chin, Chih-Wen Hsueh","Zero interest rate policy, Overlapping generations, Endogenous growth, Social welfare","In the study of the overlapping-generation model with a certain lifetime and exogenous growth, it was found that if there is a simple monetary policy where each cohort receives an equal lump-sum monetary transfer from the government, this might result in intergenerational wealth redistribution, and therefore the zero interest rate policy (Friedman rule) fails to be the optimal monetary policy. However, if the government provides different fiscal transfers for each cohort, the redistribution effect could be offset and the zero interest rate policy becomes optimal. Nevertheless, the economic growth rate is positive and the lifetime of a person is uncertain in reality. We consider an uncertain lifetime, endogenous growth, and the role of money as a medium of exchange in an overlapping-generation model. This paper results in different conclusions from the literature: (1) the zero interest rate policy fails to be the optimal monetary policy no matter whether each cohort receives an equal lump-sum monetary transfer from the government; (2) the social welfare from different fiscal transfers to each cohort is larger than that from equal lump-sum monetary transfer; (3) the nominal interest rate target is indeterminacy and then the economic outcome does not always stay at the long-run equilibrium, unless the honest government is willing to maintain the stability of the real money balance, and then the nominal interest rate target can be determinacy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201910-201910220011-201910220011-97-144,50.1,2019,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
ECONOMIC GLOBALIZATION AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME INEQUALITY: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF TAIWAN,"Mei-Ying Lai, Judith Liu, Zong-Shin Liu","Household income inequality, Trade liberalization, Foreign direct investment","Since the 1980s, Taiwan has adopted trade liberalization policies and gradually promoted financial liberalization; meanwhile, the extent of household income inequality has become pronounced over time. The goal of this paper is to empirically investigate whether economic globalization (trade and financial liberalization) has led to the rising household income inequality in Taiwan. Our analysis is based on time-series data from 1980 to 2013 with the consideration of five domestic control variables. The empirical results show that trade openness reduces the income inequality, whereas capital outflows result in an increase in income inequality. Since capital outflows only constitute a very small share of GDP, economic globalization tends to lower income inequality overall. Our results indicate that technological progress in favor of skilled labor is the main driver of the rising household income inequality.

First, we concisely introduce the KLEMS approach to the growth accounting method. We estimate the industrial-level TFP using Taiwanese and Korean KLEMS databases. The empirical results show that, Taiwan's and Korea's output growth rates during 1981-1990 were higher than those of other periods. After 1990, the output growth rates slowed down for both economies. The contribution of intermediate inputs (II) accounts for majority of the gross output growth rate. The contributions of II of tertiary industries are much less than those of secondary industries. Among the intermediate inputs, material contribution is the highest in secondary industries, whereas service contribution is the highest in tertiary industries. The contribution of labor input is slight in Taiwan and Korea. Furthermore, in Taiwan, the performance of the TFP growth rate in service is better than that of manufacturing industries, whereas the performance of the TFP growth rate in manufacturing industries is better than that of service industries in Korea. Taiwan has greatly outperformed Korea in TFP of service industries in past decades. This implies a good potential to expand service industries in Taiwan. Korea's TFP for the service industries as a whole were found to be negative in all three past decades.

We focus on the current-quarter growth rate forecasts of real GDP and its components (consumer spending, investment, government spending, imports, and exports), which are measured based on a fixed-based method. For the sample period from November 2004 to August 2014, the quarterly data including forecasts and realizations are collected from 40 different vintages. Some important findings are as follows. First, the examination of direction-of-change forecasts indicates that over 20% of DGBAS current-quarter forecasts predicted wrong directions for changes in real GDP and its components from the previous quarter to the target one. Besides, most forecast errors depended on their past values and on the previous economic state; that information was helpful to improve the forecasting performance. Although DGBAS currently constructs the real values via the chain-linked method instead of a fixed-based one, its reference forecasting models and methods are not supposed to be revised too much. Therefore, the results of this paper are expected to be helpful to improve DGBAS's models and methods for forecasting and real GDP and its components.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201903-201903210007-201903210007-85-119,49.2,2019,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Among various approaches to raising revenues, this paper compares increasing the tax evasion penalty rate on underground economic activity to increasing the consumption tax rate, using a two-sector DSGE model. It finds that both approaches can raise revenues but have very different sectoral effects: raising the tax evasion penalty shrinks the underground economy and increases the out- put of the formal sector, opposite to the effects of raising consumption taxes. Increasing the consumption tax rate has more negative effects on output than increasing the tax evasion penalty for a given revenue-to-output share raised on impact. The paper also finds that higher sectoral elasticity between labor of the two sectors produces less negative effects on total output.

LOCATION CHOICE AND TAX INCENTIVES OF PROFIT SHIFTING: THE CASE OF TAIWAN'S MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS,"Shinemay Chen, Wei-Min Hu","Locational choice, Tax treaty, Profit shifting, Treaty shopping, Mixed logit","Over the past few years, foreign investment in many countries has adopted multi-level, complex, multinational ownership control structures. In Taiwan in 2015, for example, only 22.24% of overseas subsidiaries of Taiwanese listed companies were controlled by Taiwan's parent companies, and up to 77.76% of overseas subsidiaries were held by intermediary affiliates. This phenomenon is often viewed by tax authorities in various countries as an arrangement for profit shifting which leads to tax base erosion. In this study, we adopt a mixed logit method, with the sample of 9,789 new subsidiaries of Taiwan's listed companies from 2001 to 2015, located in 79 countries, to explore the influence of tax incentives relevant to profit shifting on the overseas location choice of multinational corporations. This project is the first to examine whether the implementation of transfer pricing or capital thinning provisions of the host country can affect the location choice of Taiwan's subsidiaries, and it is also the first in the literature to explore the effect of bilateral tax treaties or treaty shopping on the location choice. Finally, through counterfactual analysis, we estimate the relative change in the probability of location choice due to relevant scenarios of tax policy changes in in various countries. Estimation results of the mean or fixed coefficients show that transfer pricing rules, capital thinning regulation and signature of a bilateral tax treaty with Taiwan are all disincentives for profit shifting, reducing the chances of Taiwanese listed companies establishing new subsidiaries in the country. In contrast, a tax haven or an extensive network of tax treaty agreements is a tax incentive for corporations to make profit transfers and increases the chances of establishing a new subsidiary. The results of counterfactual analysis predict that after the bilateral tax treaty with Taiwan comes into effect, China will lose 29.51 percentage points of all the newly established subsidiaries of Taiwan's multination corporations, mainly to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, the United States and India. Finally, by simulating a unilateral reduction of tax rates by 15%in each country, we find that the attraction of the tax reform in the United States towards the end of 2017 to Taiwan's listed companies in choosing the United States as a new subsidiary is disadvantageous to the same tax cuts implemented in China, Hong Kong and Japan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201810-201810230012-201810230012-47-96,49.1,2018,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Results from the Probit regression, statistic test and difference-in-difference (DID) analysis suggest that the estate and gift tax reform in 2009 affects inter vivos property transfers siginificantly: in cases where decedents' net wealth is higher than the estate tax exemption, the tax reform increases individuals' willingness to make inter vivos property transfers, the number of annual gifts, and the amount of annual gifts; furthermore, the effect is increasing with respect to the level of net wealth.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201810-201810230012-201810230012-97-146,49.1,2018,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

In this study, the global vector autoregression (hereafter GVAR) model proposed by Pesaran et al. (2004) is applied to analyze how the QE policies of the U.S. and Japan affect Taiwan's economy. Four different circumstances are considered here: (1) the U.S. Federal Reserve tapered its QE policy, (2) the Bank of Japan reduces its economic boost and tapers its QE policy off, (3) both the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan wind down their bond buying stimulus programs, and (4) the U.S. Federal Reserve tapers its QE policy but the Bank of Japan adopts a QE policy. Our results indicate that the performance of the GVAR model is encouraging in the sense that the effects of various QE shocks on core macro variables of interest are generally consistent with the predictions based on the standard macroeconomic theory. In case (1), the effect of the QE tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve implies a decrease in the real output of Taiwan in the short run. It also has a negative impact on Taiwan's stock market. Similar results can also be found in case (2). However, the impacts of the QE tapering by the Bank of Japan are not statistically significant. In case (3), both the QE tapering in the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan have a significant negative effect on the real GDP and stock price in Taiwan.

This paper examines the effects of an expansion in public construction investment expenditure. We assume two alternatives for financing such expenditures. The first is an increase in income tax, and the second is an increase in indirect taxes as the source for government investment. Simulation results show that increased government investment will have a more positive effect on GDP than increased government consumption. Additionally, government investment induces further private investment. Using income taxes to finance investment can reduce domestic income inequality. Indirect taxation, on the other hand, can have a positive effect on financial debt if used for government consumption.

Foreign enterprises and local high-tech industries have expressed serious concerns about this issue. They have even projected that there will be power shortages after 2017, and the production costs due to uncertainty of power supply will increase dramatically. If power supply reliability decreases, it will heavily erode the spinning reserve of the power system and increase the probability of power shortages. Power users, including industrial users and residential users, will bear losses due to interruptions of electricity supply. The present study adopts a CGE model (EnFore-Green) to estimate power outage costs at the macro level in Taiwan. The average power outage costs are forecast to be about 1.01-4.01 NT$/kWh for the production sector, and 0.09-2.19 NT$/kWh for household sector.

A series of questions are asked: (1) How serious is intergenerational inequity in Taiwan? (2) How severe is the long-term fiscal insolvency? (3) Does the proposed pension reform solve these two problems? (4)What options do we have regarding pension reform? To address these questions, we apply the Generational Accounting method to 2014 NTA data and official population projections. We calculated the generational accounts under different scenarios. The results suggest that both fiscal insufficiency and intergenerational inequity are serious, calling for immediate response. However, the current government proposal is far from adequate, as there are only piecemeal and short-term considerations.

This paper focuses on the empirical analysis of equity within the civil servants, old-age income system, and conducts comparisons for four generations of cohorts whose service years started in 1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001 respectively. This study shows that multipliers of benefits to contribution vary across generations, ranging from 11 to 38; the earlier into the system, the higher the multiplier. Internal rates of return, which are derived in the range of 11.0% to 23.3%, display a similar pattern, which is the earlier into the system, the higher the IRR. These findings pinpoint the controversial issues back to the 1995 reform which was biased in favor of those who entered the public sector prior to 1995 and accordingly deteriorated the system's financial strength. In summary, though the young generation pays more into the system, the benefits received among different cohorts all reflect a high level in terms of the replacement rate and dollar amount. This phenomenon corresponds to the fixed replacement rate theory by Musgrave (1986). In addition to presentation of the current system, this paper also conducts analysis of IRR and multipliers based on the reform draft concluded from the Pension Reform National Symposium of 2016.

Major Taiwanese Pension Funds' International Investments and Currency Hedging Strategies,"Shean-Bii Chiu, Hsing-Kuo Lai","Pension fund, Currency hedging strategy, International investment","International investments constitute more than 40% of the assets of major pension funds in Taiwan. However, exchange rate fluctuations also affect funds' short-term returns significantly. Taiwanese pension funds' managers use their experience and intuition to determine whether to and how much to hedge currency risks. In this paper, we follow the framework of Campbell et al. (2010) and combine information on international financial markets and major Taiwanese pension funds' asset allocation to produce the currency hedge ratios which minimize the variance of quarterly returns of each fund. For foreign bond investment, the risk-minimizing strategy is basically 100% hedge. The risk-minimizing hedge ratios of foreign stock portfolios depend on the respective stock markets and currencies. Exposures on the US and Japan stock markets should not be hedged, while exposures on Australia and Canada should be over-hedged. Using actual asset allocations of pension funds in January 2016, we suggest that managers do not need to hedge USD exposure. These results are striking, as they differ significantly from managers' intuition and current practice. We demonstrate a model to determine currency hedging strategies for pension funds.

By fitting the survival model to household data from the May 2012 Manpower Utilization Survey of Taiwan, the estimation results can be briefly summarized as follows: (1) Of all the covariates, for- mal schooling level imposes the greatest positive effect on the time length of current job tenure and hence has the greatest mitigating effect on the risk that the current job tenure fails (terminates); conversely, atypical employment imposes the largest negative effect on the time length of current job tenure and hence has the largest increasing effect on the failure risk of current job tenure. (2) The current job tenure of the reference subject fails around 8 times earlier (or ages around 8 times faster) than that of the subject with covariates. More interestingly, this implies that the risk that the current job tenure of the subject fails at a given survival time equals only around an eighth the risk that the current job tenure of the reference subject fails at about an eighth times earlier than the given survival time.

Technology Advantage and Home-Market Effect: A Poisson QuasiMaximum Likelihood Estimation,"Yo-Yi Huang, Deng-Shing Huang","Home-market effect, Technology advantage, Gravity equation, Poisson quasi maximum likelihood estimation","According to the conventional home-market effect, free trade tends to shrink the market share for a small economy with differentiated manufacturing goods, and in the extreme leads to a complete hollowing-out of the industry in a small economy. This paper considers the technology difference between countries using the standard Helpman-Krugman model. We will show that the home-market effect can be offset and even reversed if the smaller economy is characterized by better technology. The effect of a technology advantage is composed of two parts: a direct effect from lower unit costs that lead to a higher output level of each firm, and an indirect effect through a change in terms of which firms survive after trade. Based on theoretical results, we derive the gravity equation to conduct empirical tests on the hypothesis of the home-market effect, and direct and indirect technology effects using the US patent stock of 2002 for eleven industries ranging from the most technology-intensive industry to the most labor-intensive apparel and clothing industry. Empirical results show that the degree of the home-market effect varies from industry to industry. The reversal of the home-market effect is more likely to occur in technology-intensive industries.

CONSUMPTION DURING RETIREMENT: EVIDENCE USING A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING METHOD,Wehn-Jyuan Tsai,"Life cycle model, Retirement, Consumption, Matching","It is widely acknowledged that population aging will exert intense fiscal pressure on public pension and health care programs. However, a focus on these financial costs has led to an unduly negative view of population ageing that neglects the well-being of older citizens. In this paper, we use the 1996- 2006 waves of the Family Income and Expenditure Survey to study the effect of retirement on household nondurable expenditures. We construct a novel matched dataset using the nearest neighbor matching method in which the just-retired household heads serve as a treatment group, and both the employed and the retired household heads serve as a forward-matching and backward-matching control group, respectively. The empirical results suggest that there is a one-off drop in food expenditures at the time of retirement for households in the lowest wealth tertile. These results therefore imply that the quantity of food intake did deteriorate with retirement status for relatively poor households.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201603-201604060032-201604060032-45-85,46.2,2016,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
THE BOTTLENECK OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN TAIWAN: FROMTHE R&D POINT OF VIEW,"Kao-Chao Lee, Chun-Chiang Feng","R&D, Industrial linkage, Spillover effect","The real wage in Taiwan has not increased for more than ten years. This indicates the economy had lost its growth momentum. For the empirical study, we use the Solow Model, which however tends to underestimate the contribution of R&Dto economic growth. Therefore we extend the theoretical analysis to derive the capital and labor demand curves of Taiwan. Increase in R&D inputs will lead to a rise in capital investments, capital returns, wage, and employment. Improvement in export competitiveness can be an indirect result as well. Consequently, it can raise consumption, investment, and export. To sum up, R&D is the main driving force of economic growth. Using input-output analysis,we found that R&D has a high spillover effect. Adequate combination of R&D inputs and infrastructure investment can push the economic growth towards the optimal path.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201603-201604060032-201604060032-87-118,46.2,2016,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

It is very likely that, if not properly regulated, our employment of these technologiesmay leave those future people with an environment unbearable for them to live in. Ordinary people would believe that if we knowingly don't do whatever is necessary to prevent such things from happening to them, we will harm them in an unforgivably wrongful way, or in any case violate their basic human rights when they come to exist. According to this belief, we have moral duties toward these future peoplewhich are based on considerations of so-called ＂intergenerational justice＂.

For them, these concepts have no use when it comes to understanding ourmoral relation to peoplewhose life-span does not overlap ours. They would insist that even though we ought by all means to care about the well-being of these future people, this does not stem from duties of justice or of ＂do no harm＂, but at most from duties of beneficence.

LEGAL ISSUES OF INTERGENERATIONAL EQUITY: AN INTRODUCTION,Chien-Liang Lee,"Intergenerational equity, Sustainable development, Intergenerational law, Rights, Obligations, Due process, Choice of institutions","This article aims at discussing legal issues surrounding equity and justice between present and future generations, from a legal and normative perspective that incorporates both international and local outlooks. Specifically, this article discusses the principle of intergenerational equity and sustainable development in the following six dimensions: dialectical analysis of the core concepts, normative contents and their implementation, imagery of rights, discourse of obligations, due process, and construction of relevant mechanisms. This article argues that the human society at present should be seen as accommodating different generations in partnership coexistence in which everyone should work for the continuation of human generations and wellbeing, and in this light, the conceptual orientation should shifted from ＂development＂ toward ＂sustainability＂. Further, because the concept of sustainability contains an element of generational continuation of life, the concept of sustainable development, as a subject of legal studies, necessarily incorporates the perspective of ＂Intergenerational Law＂. From the perspective of democracy and the rule of law, sustainable development should have ＂generational sustainability＂ as the imagery ideals in guiding the formulation of its legal frameworks and mechanisms under the ＂law of generational sustainability＂. One task that is of paramount importance is to amend the constitution by adding a clause on the principle of sustainability and the state’s obligation in ensuring intergenerational equity- such as providing that ＂The State shall observe the principle of sustainability in protection of the interest of future generations＂- , so as to make a clear normative statement reflecting the consensus of people in guiding Taiwan toward a sustainable state and a community of justice.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201603-201604060032-201604060032-209-242,46.2,2016,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

A Study on the Distributional Effect of the Old-Age Benefits of Labor Insurance,Joan C. Lo,"Labor insurance, Old-age benefits, Income redistribution","Establishing a Social Security scheme with income redistribution is an aim for all nations. The majority of OECD countries has a redistribution feature in their pension systems. We first define the present value (PV) of all contributions as insurees' liabilities, the PV of all retirement benefits as their entitlements, and the PV of insurees' lifetime insured salaries as the baseline distribution, then employ the Gini coefficient to study the distributional effect of the old-age benefits of Labor Insurance. The results show that the current Labor Insurance system worsens the income distribution; however, the proposal to reform both the benefit structures as well as raising the contribution rates will improve it. Furthermore, the sooner the contribution rate rises, the better the distribution becomes. Since for each contribution dollar, the insuree can get 7 to 8 dollars back in retirement benefits, those with higher income actually benefit more in the current system. That is contradictory to equity; it should therefore be scrutinized and changed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201510-201511180024-201511180024-43-74,46.1,2015,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

The paper adopts a different approach to the forecasting exercise that combines these existing models. The approach not only makes best use of available information, but also is free of model selection risks. The forecast performance of the combination model is found to outperform those of any single aforementioned model and a random walk in the samples. Specifically the cumulative sum of squared forecating errors of our combination model is remarkably reduced. The reductions in forecast errors can be attributed to the time-varying weights that are assinged according to the relative magnitudes of bias and variance of each considered model. Moreover, the samples span over US subprime crisis and quantitative easing, where each of the considered models finds it not easy to yield good forecast on exchange rate movements. Associated with the finding is that the corresponding bias and variance of each considered model display dramatic shifts in these recent global economic events, implying that the combination is able to extract useful information from each considered model alone to yield more accurate exchange rate predictions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201510-201511180024-201511180024-75-111,46.1,2015,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Economic transformation is no longer from light industry to heavy industry, but the self-replacement and self-destruction of old technologies. In the past decade, many economies including Taiwan, instead of exercising such painful and costly self-destruction, have chosen an easier way to survival, which is moving factories to nearby low-cost countries. Their business model is ＂taking orders locally and producing overseas＂, which has caused five kinds of social inequality problems, which are specifically freezing the increment of local-wages, unequal income distribution, risingmetro housing prices, decreasing social mobility and difficulty of moving upward through education.

The studies find that income inequality among social classes has continuously increased, and point out two sources of the inequality: (1) industrial upgrading led to in-creasing wage inequality between skilled workers and unskilled workers; (2) the cross-strait open trade policy under the globalization context led to increasing income inequality between the employers plus some top managers who went to China for investment, and the local employees plus self-employed in Taiwan. The increasing class inequality also results in declining class mobility, shrinking subjective social status, and rising political discontent among middle-and lower-class people.

The empirical evidence from linear and threshold cointegration models suggests that the pass-through from the offical rate to de-posit rates is incomplete, and that to lending rates is complete or overshooting in the long run. For both deposit rates and lending rates, the immediate impact from changes in the offical rate is less than the magnitude of long run pass-through, indicating sluggish adjustment. And the mean adjustment lag of a complete pass-through for deposit rates is less than two months. Besides, this research also examines whether interest rate rigidity is different when the offical rate is increasing or decreasing. It is concluded that both deposit rates and lending rates are more rigid when they are rising. Evidence of rigidity of deposit rates increases supports the collusive hypothesis and the rigidity of lending rates increases coincides with the hypothesis of adverse customer reaction and asymmetric information.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201403-201404300018-201404300018-45-101,44.2,2014,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Simulation result show that, if the ECFA ”Early Harvest Program” is implemented, the amount of overall labor demand is expected to increase by 33,000 jobs (+0.319%); if a comprehensive trade liberalization of industrial products according to ECFA is put into force, the overall labor demand will increase by 119,000 jobs (+1.214%). Overall, ECFA will benefit all levels of household income. However, the biggest beneficiaries of cross-strait trade liberalization are the highest income group families.

We evaluate the forecasting performance of the three institutions in terms of the conventional criteria and the usefulness tests recently developed by Lin et al. (2011). More specifically, we analyze the samples for the annual and quarterly projections released by CIER, DGBAS and IEAS from 1996 to 2010. Our findings are as follows. First, the directional accuracy statistics show that the one-year-ahead annual projections are generally well produced. Second, Ashley's usefulness statistics indicate that the current-quarter forecasts released by those institutions perform the best. In addition, based on the tests for usefulness (Lin et al., 2011), the annual forecasts have also done a good job. Overall, the current year forecasts (prepared in the middle of the same year) produced by DGBAS and the next-year forecasts (prepared at the end of each year) produced by IEAS perform the best. Meanwhile, the current-year forecasts for the changes in trade between Taiwan and specific countries produced by CIER also provide useful information.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201310-201311110045-201311110045-81-132,44.1,2013,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
Agglomeration and Productivity: Firm-Level Evidence from Taiwan's Textile Industry,"Wei-Che Su, Ya-Ting Yu, Chih-Hai Yang","Agglomeration, Productivity, Textile industry","The ”New Economic Geography” theories claim that the geographical concentration can generate externalities through the advantages of knowledge spillover and specialization, thereby promoting firm productivity. This argument is widely supported in studies based on high-tech industries, while its application for traditional industries remains less examined. This paper aims to calculate the degree of agglomeration and its influences on productivity in Taiwan's textile industry. Using plant-Ievel panel data during the periods of 1997-2000 and 2002-2003, we find the textile industry has high geographic concentration. Econometric estimates show that geographic agglomeration has a positive and nonlinear relationship with firms' productivity, particularly for small firms. Moreover, R&D exhibits a significantly positive impact on productivity, suggesting that innovation remains a key factor promoting productivity for the traditional industry of textiles in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201310-201311110045-201311110045-133-160,44.1,2013,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

In the study, those who had retired in 2007were categorized into the experimental group, while those who were qualified to retire but had not retired for the ensuing 3 years were categorized into the control group. The results indicate that after controlling for all influential factors such as gender and years of service, the incentive displayed a positive impact. On average, it had increased the insured earnings by 10.7%. Changing the benefit calculation formula to using the average monthly amounts of the highest 60 months of insured earning would not generate much impact. Using a much longer period as the basis for benefit calculation can help to alleviate or even eliminate the incentive impact, thus removing the extra financial burden caused by the incentive mechanism embedded in the benefit calculation formula of the labor insurance system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201303-201304240030-201304240030-1-22,43.2,2013,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

There exist several methods for this purpose and a partial list includes the univariate detrending method, the multivariate filtering approach, and the structural VAR system approach. One common feature of all these methods is assuming the existence of a unit root for the unobserved potential GDP. While this assumption is appropriate for the cases of US and most European countries where macroeconomic data are seasonally adjusted, it does not fit the Taiwanese economy. Almost all of Taiwan's macroeconomic data are seasonally unadjusted, and the seasonal unit root as well as richer dynamics have to be embedded in the model. In this paper, we analyze the impact of seasonality on various potential output measures. To check robustness and investigate how sensitive the results are to further changes in the specification of the NAIRU and the unemployment gap, distinct classes of NAIRU and unemployment gap concept are implemented. Empirical analysis confirms the importance of seasonal behavior. Switching from a regular unit root to a seasonal unit root improves the efficiency of measuring potential GDP and output gap for Taiwan and provides more relevant information in conducting monetary and fiscal policies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201303-201304240030-201304240030-23-49,43.2,2013,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

The empirical results show that the relationship of pass-through and both inflation and deflation is changed after considering the deflation impacts. The pass-through of the fuel industry varies most with inflation movements. Most industries exhibit larger pass-through in deflation than in low inflation.

The empirical result which is based on the gravity model shows that the outward FDI of Taiwanese multinationals is generally affected by the market factors, but the impact of labor cost and human capital depends on different industries and market location factors which are relevant to different needs for relatively low-skilled workers and relatively high-skilled workers.Our empirical results, which use sensitivity analysis to find out the variance between the industry and the market, are consistent with the predictions of our initial analysis. By the implications of the Kaitz index and information from other labor factors, we show that manufacturers will particularly emphasize technical requirements when they invest in developed countries. However, manufacturers will invest in developing countries with strong considerations of their lower labor cost. Because Mainland China has both inducements of market potential and lower-cost labor, the empirical result also shows that FDI in Mainland China is notably higher than in developed and other developing countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201303-201304240030-201304240030-83-122,43.2,2013,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

The stock holiday regressors from this approach have a very simple and appealing form when the flow regressors have standard properties. The modeling, forecasting and graphical results we present, for Easter effects in U.S. manufacturing inventories and for Chinese New Year effects in economic indicator inventory series of Taiwan, confirm the utility of this first general approach to modeling stock holiday effects.

Seasonal adjustment aims to remove effects associated with the time of the year (for example, higher sales at Christmas) or the arrangement of the calendar (for example, Easter moving between March and April). Each of the 12 Gregorian calendar months is represented in the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) by a four-or five-week-long survey month, and the time series must therefore be ”calendarised”, through the application of regARIMA modelling, in order to improve the quality of seasonally adjusted estimates. This process is tried and tested but, in October 2010, the UK LFS was subject to a one-week-long survey break, or ”leapweek”, in order to align its reporting periods with those of the rest of the European Union-which presented a novel problem.

Energy Price Shocks and Taiwan's Macroeconomy,"Hung-Chun Chen, Biing-Shen Kuo, Shinn-Juh Lin","Energy price, Granger causality test, Autoregressive distributed lag model","Since the 1970s, numerous studies have demonstrated that energy price changes can have a significant impact on a country's macroeconomy. However, there is no consensus regarding in what form, or by which channel can energy price changes affect the macroeconomy. In addition, economic decision makers often respond to energy price changes with a time lag due to the existence of uncertainty. This paper constructs several indicators of symmetric and asymmetric energy price changes based on the energy prices in Taiwan for the period from 1981 to 2009. We employ Granger's causality test to examine the relationship between energy price changes and related macroeconomic variables; and utilize the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate the long-run relation between energy price changes and the real GDP of Taiwan. Our empirical results show that energy price exhibits exogeneity relative to important macroeconomic variables; neither the energy price growth rate, nor the energy price net increase/decrease has a significant impact on real GDP, while the energy price volatility has a negative impact on the real GDP of Taiwan. Furthermore, the estimation result of the ARDL model indicates the existence of a long-term inverse relation between energy price volatility and the real GDP. These imply that, since 1981, uncertainty and sectoral shift may have been the two possible asymmetric channels through which energy price shocks affected Taiwan's output growth rate.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201203-201204230013-201204230013-3-38,42.2,2012,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

The drops in labor demand outweigh the drops in labor supply of unskilled labor since 1994 are attributable to the negative growth in their wage rates. By contrast, after 2001, the rises in the labor supply of skilled workers outweigh the rises in their labor demand, which explains the decline in their wage rates. The growths of human capital both in education and working experience significantly explained the large amount of wage growth over the period of 1978-2008.

We compare the labor market performance between the generations of the immigrants from China to Taiwan after 1949 and natives in Taiwan. Natives are represented by Hokkien and Hakka. Three main findings are as follows. First, the status of an immigrant's father being a first-generation mainlander and/or an immigrant's mother being a native has no significant effect on earnings of adult children. Instead, the status of being a more highly educated mother affects earnings of those second-generation children significantly. Meanwhile, as compared to their immigrant counterparts, natives have higher earnings if they work in the public sector or if they have language proficiency in Mandarin. Second, different from other countries, immigrants on average have wages higher than natives in Taiwan. The wage differential can be almost fully explained by explainable factors, the productivity differential in the labor market, rather than unexplainable or ”discrimination” factors. Finally, wage differentials within a specific ethnic cohort and between immigrants and natives across cohorts are significant, but the earnings gap between immigrants and natives have shrunk for younger cohorts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201110-201111150010-201111150010-39-74,42.1,2011,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

The results fromHeckman's two-step estimation approach can be summarized as follows: (1) A series of demographic characteristics, such as human capital, class of worker, retirement status, sex, marital status, and industry are not only an important component of the wage rate, but also an important element in affecting the probabilities of unemployment among labor force participants as well as atypical employment among the employed. (2) Imputing the wages of the unemployed based on the two-stage estimation model shows that the conditional wages that the unemployed are expected to receive are substantially lower than those that the employees could earn. (3) Since the wage rates of atypical workers generally are not lower than those of typical workers, the reason that the total earnings of atypical workers are lower than those of typical workers can be attributed to the concealed fact that the working hours of atypicalworkers are less than those of typicalworkers, thereby indicating that there is a significant portion of atypical workers are underemployed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201110-201111150010-201111150010-75-118,42.1,2011,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

A major finding is that per capita consumption by children has increased rapidly, both absolutely and relatively by various standards, and has exceeded the increase of both prime-age adults and the elderly. The rising children consumption mainly comes from high education spending, and is increasingly supported by intra-familial transfer. These results carry important policy implications, given that the Taiwan is experiencing an extremely low fertility rate and rapid population aging on the one hand, and is pondering the implementation of more elderly welfare programs on the other. Thus the resource competition between age groups is expected to accelerate while long-term economic development may be unfavorably affected.

Examining Taiwan's Household Types and Their Functions from the Perspective of Parents' Living Arrangements,"Chao-Nan Chen, Hui-Lin Lin","Social support, Family, Household","Following Sussman's suggestion, this study aims to examine the impact of household separation on intergenerational support exchange. Living arrangements and marital status of respondent's siblings are used to classify household types. The respondents who live with their parents are referred to as ”co-residing with respondents”. The rest of the respondents are grouped as ”co-residing with respondent’s married siblings” and ”others”. The 2006 Taiwan Social Change Survey data show that about 50% of parents are living with the survey respondents. The shares of those co-residing with respondent's married siblings are 16% and 19% for fathers and mothers, respectively, while the share accounted for by ”others” is 33% for both fathers and mothers. The three types of household differ in terms of the pattern of intergenerational support exchange. Those co-residing with respondent's married siblings and ”others” provide more but receive less financial support and concern than the respondents who live with their parents. They, however, exchange less by way of household chores with parents than those living with parents. Generally speaking, children living in households separated from parents become autonomous but not isolated, or function well in providing support to parents.

While the foreign demand shock has received attention in the literature, the importance of labor (intra-temporal) wedge to the 2001 recession is new to the literature.

Estimating the Effects of Fiscal Policy in a Small Open Economy: The Case of Taiwan,"Li-Hua Lee, Teh-Ming Huo, Mau-Min Chu","Small open economy, Structural VAR, Sign restrictions, Fiscal policy shocks","This study applies sign restrictions to identify fiscal policy for a small open economy in the case of Taiwan. We follow methods adopted by Mountford and Uhlig (2009) and Ho and Yeh (2010) to identify aggregate supply shock, aggregate demand shock, monetary policy shock, and fiscal policy shock (including government spending shock and government revenue shock). Several main findings are summarized. Government spending shock may induce crowding-out effects in private investment in the short-term, but will increase private investment in the mid-term and long-term. Government spending shock can also raise short-term interest rates, resulting in an influx of foreign capital into domestic country and subsequently increasing the real effective exchange rate and decreasing the trade balance. Government spending shock initially has positive effects on real GDP, and then lowers real GDP due to crowding-out effects in the short-term. Once mid-term private investment is driven up by government spending, it will produce positive effects on real GDP, but this is not significant.
From the perspective of government revenue, government revenue shock has positive effects on real GDP, private consumption and private investment in the short-term, but has negative effects in the long-term.
In a closer examination, by dividing government spending into two components, government consumption spending and government investment spending, it is found that significant effects on real GDP might be generated by government consumption spending shock, but not by government investment spending.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201103-201104150045-201104150045-51-93,41.2,2011,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

In contrast, when applied to intraday data at various frequencies, none of the technical trading rules we test are significantly profitable. Overall, on Taiwan's FX market, we did not find evidence that technical trading rules are more profitable with a shorter time horizon. Further analyses lead to two interesting findings. First of all, differential performance of technical trading rules in daily trading versus intraday trading is related to the magnitudes of price-changes of foreign exchange rates. Second, the essence of the moving average trading rule can be captured by a Markov switching model. The implication is that, if the targeted asset prices could be better fitted by a Markov switching model, traders may obtain decent profitability by adopting the moving average trading rule in their investment strategy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201103-201104150045-201104150045-95-126,41.2,2011,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
Who Wins and Who Loses in Transparent Markets? Daily and Intraday Analysis of Taiwan Stock Market,"Hsiu-Kuei Chen, Shu-Fan Hsieh, Tai Ma","Execution cost, Price impact, Implementation shortfall, Pre-trade transparency, Intraday analysis","This paper provides evidence regarding the welfare effect of pre-trade transparency according to investor and order type. In order to appreciate the manner in which welfare varies with market transparency, it is necessary to examine investors’ behavioral adjustments (aggressiveness and order size adjustments) with respect to market transparency. We find that both individual and institutional investors are more willing to supply liquidity following the enhancement of market transparency. Although individual investors behave more aggressively and submit larger orders when they supply and demand liquidity, institutional investors are relatively more conservative and submit smaller orders in an open environment. The welfare of investors is measured in terms of implementation shortfall, which is the weighted average of price impacts and opportunity costs. Our main conclusion is that both institutional and individual investors, but especially institutional investors, who demand immediacy benefit from pre-trade transparency; however, individual investors who supply liquidity lose on account of pre-trade transparency. Further, intraday analysis indicates that although transparency enhancement is most detrimental for individual investors providing liquidity during the period approaching market close, it is most beneficial for institutional and individual investors demanding liquidity during the period approaching the close of markets.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201103-201104150045-201104150045-127-178,41.2,2011,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
The Macro-Economic Effects of Terminating the Statute for Upgrading Industries,"Wen-Hsiu Huang, Chien-Fu Jeff Lin","Tax reduction, The statue for upgrading industries, Macro-econometric model","This paper analyzes the effects of terminating the Statute for Upgrading Industries on Taiwan economy. The tax reduction policies in the Statue for Upgrading Industries offer tax incentives for private investment. Therefore, canceling the tax reduction policies may have negative impacts on the economy. The simulations show that reducing both the individual and corporate income tax is better than increasing the government spending after comparing the methods to alleviate the negative effects of canceling the tax reduction policies, because the former can effectively stimulate the economic growth rate, raise real GDP and improve income distribution. In this situation, the budget balance may deteriorate, and the government debt to GDP ratio becomes higher in the short run. However, the sustainable economic growth trend will make the tax revenue expand gradually. Finally, the public finance situation can improve in the end. But the problem is that the progressive effects of the income tax become weaker in this scenario.

First, the data information problem exists when one estimates Taiwan's Taylor rules with revised data. Second, Taiwan's monetary policy is forward-looking and the monetary authority's response to a positive output gap is not symmetric to its response to a negative output gap.

In addition, an adjustment of the interbank rate influences the stock market and housing market via an adjustment of bank loans; and further, it affects domestic demand.

Cross-Border Transmission Effect of an Increase in Energy and Raw Materials Prices,"Shih-Mo Lin, Tsai-Tzu Chang, Jin-Xu Lin, Yung-Ho Weng","Energy, Raw material, Input-output price model, Asian international input-output table, Price control","The rise of energy and raw material prices brought inflation in many countries. Some countries tried to analyze the influence on commodity prices and the price index caused by the rise of energy or raw material prices. The purpose of this paper is to build an inter-regional input-output price model and to explain the price transmission caused by the rise of imported energy and raw material prices. Based on theory and simulation, the results show that the effect of a rise in international energy prices can be decomposed into direct and indirect effects. The impacts under an inter-regional input-output price model are greater than those under a single-country model. The difference of impacts in the two models is mainly caused by the feedback effect. The indirect effect was generally affected by the ratio of the imported intermediate goods to the total intermediate goods needed in production. The higher the ratio is, the bigger is the feedback effect. The policy implications of these empirical results are that the price impacts can be reduced by improving production structure, diversifying sources of imports, and price control in the public sector.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-201003-201004210019-201004210019-1-41,40.2,2010,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

The high oil prices resulted the concern that the oil crisis would come back again. No matter what the real reason for high oil prices, it is a major, urgent issue needing to be dealt with and needing solutions.
The aim of this study is to analyze the impacts of high oil prices on Taiwan's industries, especially the production cost increase in those industries, as well as the influence on international competiveness. Our study used the Taiwan Input-Output Database and the Global trade analysis project (GTAP) model to evaluate the high oil prices’ impact on Taiwan's industries and international competitiveness. We simulated three different oil prices conditions, U.S. $ 150 per barrel, U.S. $ 200 per barrel, and U.S. $ 250 per barrel, and estimated the variation of the prices and outputs of Taiwan's manufacturing and services industries.
The results showed that under the scenario of high oil prices, the impact was most serious on Taiwan's chemical, rubber, plastic products, petroleum, coal products, textiles, trade services and electricity industries. But due to energy efficiency and international competiveness, the electronic equipment and machinery and equipment industries would have good potential to grow.

Both shortrun and long-run policy simulations were conducted in the model using Keynesian and neoclassical closures. Our research findings suggest that TNCP helps Taiwan’s economic growth in the short run. Its effect, however, is not as large as expected. In the long run, TNCP contributes to small economic growth effects and leads to a significant increase in price levels. The investment multiplier and income multiplier effects of TNCP are both insignificant in our policy simulations. This research supports the proposition that the effectiveness of government fiscal policies depends on the stage of economic development of a state and the composition of government investment spending. After more than 30 years of fast economic development, Taiwan has now converged gradually to the steady-state equilibrium of a mature economy.

The Effect of Energy Tax on Energy Demand and the Economy of Taiwan,Chi-Yuan Liang,"Energy tax, Carbon tax, CGE model, Translog function","The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of an energy tax with tax reform on the price, output growth, energy demand and CO2 emission by sector and for the economy as a whole. The findings will be useful for policy making. The simulationmodel employed is a Dynamic General Equilibrium Model of Taiwan (DGEMT) or Liang and Jorgensen (2003) Model. The major findings of this paper are as follows: (1) To implement an energy tax with tax reform will result in a significant improvement in CO2 reduction and industrial restructuring, while it has a moderately negative impact on inflation and economic growth. (2) The benefit of imposing an energy tax in terms of the reduction of CO2 and air pollution is estimated at NT $151.71 billion in 2018. Compared with the loss of GDP (NT $115.56 billion), the net benefit of imposing an energy tax amounts to NT $36.15 billion in 2018. Consequently, we conclude that to implement an energy tax with tax reform is economically feasible, and hence it is worthy adoption by the government. It is also suggested that the energy tax should be levied according to energy carbon content (i.e. carbon tax) to enhance its effect on CO2 reduction and to moderate its negative impact on the economy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200910-200911100013-200911100013-45-78,40.1,2009,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
Economic Effects of Energy Taxation: A Computable General Equilibrium Analysis in the Presence of Parameter Uncertainty,Hao-Yen Yang,"Energy taxation, Parameter uncertainty, Computable general equilibrium model","Computable general equilibrium models (CGE) are now widely used to simulate energy and climate policies in both developed and developing countries. The simulation results and conclusions reached by these models depend on the structure of production factors and the size of the parameters specified. Some empirical studies on Armington's elasticities in CGE models for energy analysis were found, but the parameter uncertainty casts doubt on the reliability of simulation results. In this paper, we have applied interval sensitivity methods for examining this type of parameter uncertainty. The objective in this paper is to provide sensitivity assessment of economic effects from changes in the parameter of elasticities in production function following the energy taxation increase. The estimates are derived from a 14-sector computable general equilibrium model calibrated to a 2004 social accounting matrix. We rely on building parameter interval sets, of which five parameters are considered. In order to obtain reliable simulation results we should employ empirical evidence gathered on the substitution elasticities from previous studies. Our results show the economic effects of energy taxations depend substantially on the degree to which capital and labor can substitute for energy. With the interval parameters incorporated, we find that extreme values of carbon emissions vary about 75%, and obtain evidence of large different results across industries and macro-variables. We also show that the economic effects of energy taxations depend on the degree of substitution between production factors. As we know, the elasticity of substitution is the degree of ease with which the firm can buy energy efficient equipments when energy costs increase. The CGE models that use a lower elasticity of substitution may have smaller economic impact by energy costs increase. Our results support the conclusion that the substitution elasticities between production factors have a major influence in evaluating energy-related policies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200910-200911100013-200911100013-79-125,40.1,2009,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

A macro-econometric model is applied to three different scenarios: the pension revenues will exceed, be equal to or be less than the pension expenditures. Based on these scenarios, we predict the implementation of labor retirement pension system will increase the cost of production and decrease the investment of the private sector and export competitiveness. We also predict that the unemployment rate and the inflation rate will increase, and the fiscal situation will become worse. In addition to these scenario analyses, we also forecast the number of retirees, based on the assumed death rate of workers aged more than 65. The forecasted number of retirees and an assumed wage increase rate and assumed pension rate are used to predict the financial situation of the labor retirement pension system in the long run. The results show that the expenditure of the pension will finally exceed the pension revenue, due to the increased number of retirees. Finally, by putting all these data into the macro-econometric model, we predict a positive effect on private consumption expenditures and negative effects on private investments, gross domestic production, employment and inflation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200910-200911100013-200911100013-127-179,40.1,2009,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Differences across demographic groups, however, were explained by changes in skill distributions, in the prices paid for the skill, and in women's labor supply behaviors. The stagger in skill prices overall, and the declines in market opportunities for the low-wage group were found to be responsible for the stagnation and low growth after 1996.

In addition, expenditure on luxury goods such as nondurable entertainment declines as much as that of necessary goods such as food. This result is inconsistent with precautionary saving motives, poor planning or Becker (1965)'s model. We further estimate an augmented Euler equation which allows for retirement and unemployment of household heads to affect households' life-cycle consumption.

An Assessment on the Regional Economic Effects of the Su-Hwa Highway Transportation Plan,"Hsing-Chun Lin, Tzu-Min Kao","Regional input-output model, Multiregional variable input-output model, Su-Hwa highway","During the process of economic development, many countries witnessed an Urban-Rural problem. Because of geographic constraints, eastern Taiwan's development pattern is different from western Taiwan's. The Executive Yuan (2002) has planned to build the Su-Hwa Highway, to achieve multiple goals of balanced regional development, doubling tourist arrivals and island-wide trunk transportation construction. Transportation is an key factor in regional development. The core-periphery relationship is sensitive to transportation, while the negative western Taiwan experiences, such as sacrificing the rights of labor and environmental conditions, make many groups which promote culture and natural ecology hesitant to approve the plan. The main concern is the worsening of eastern Taiwan's development.

Taiwanese Outward Investment: Economic Bane or Boon?,"Nai-Chia Li, Terry L. Roe","Foreign direct investment, Economic growth, Productivity","The magnitude and the rate of growth of outward investment from advanced to emerging economies have raised concerns among policymakers and economists around the globe. The concern is that capital outflows might lead to a reduction in domestic aggregate output and employment, place downward pressures on wages, especially for unskilled labor, or/and lower the rate of domestic capital deepening. These concerns threaten to induce policy change that might limit investment going abroad. However, counter evidence of beneficial effects of outward investment on technological advancement have also been established in the literature. This raises the general question this study will address: what is the nature of the economic process between outward investment and economic performance. The research interests here focus on empirically investigating, using time series data, the nature of the relationship between outward investment and productive capacity, i.e. GDP, for the home economy that provides outward investment. Contrast to the conventional belief, the econometric results indicate persistent positive lagged effects of outward investment on GDP growth despite the downward pressure on domestic employment imposed by outward investment. These results are robust to various model specification and estimation methods for both annual and quarterly data. Adopting the concept of Granger causality, the results further indicate the causal relationship from outward investment to GDP for the case of Taiwan from 1981 to 2005. These findings challenge the negative perceptions upon which conservative policies discouraging outward investment are based, and call for future research focusing on how these positive effects of outward investment on GDP are realized in the home economy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200803-38-2-73-109-a,38.2,2008,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
The Estimation of Human Capital Production and Investment from Earnings,Feng-Fuh Jiang,"Earnings, Human capital, Learning ability, Depreciation rate, Discount rate","An empirically estimatable age-earnings profile is built based on the Ben-Porath earnings-maximizing life cycle model of human capital accumulation. The earnings profile explicitly links labor earnings and human capital investments so as to estimate the scale parameters of the human capital production function and the rates of discount and human capital depreciation, which are the crucial factors in determining the optimal time path of human capital investment. Making use of household data taken from the May 1996-2003 Manpower Utilization Surveys of Taiwan, those who are more educated are found to have a higher learning ability (i.e., endowed ability to produce additional human capital) but with a lower depreciation rate and a smaller discount rate. The empirical finding not only helps explain why the more educated invest more in human capital so as to have a greater capacity of earnings, but also carries the implication that in addition to the current fiscal instruments, providing the poor with better learning environments and more accessible training programs, accompanied by lower training costs or higher training subsidies, is an active labor market means to improve the unequal distribution of wealth.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200803-38-2-111-140-a,38.2,2008,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
Ex Post Analysis of the Economic Impact of SARS on Taiwan,"Shih-Hsun Hsu, Ching-Cheng Chang, Tzu-Chiang Yang, Duu-Hwa Lee, Hsing-Chun Lin","SARS, SARS, Computable general equilibrium model, Ex post analysis, Historical simulation","The outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 resulted in significant losses to the tourism and tourism-related industries in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. Through inter-industry feedback effects, the economic impacts of SARS not only affect the tourism-related services industries, but also other industries and the whole economy. There have been a number of ex ante studies that have quantified the potential impacts of SARS on Taiwan's economy (e.g., Chou et al. 2003, Wu et al. 2003). This article provides an ex post economy-wide assessment of the SARS impacts on Taiwan. The model used is a dynamic, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Taiwan's economy (TAIGEM-D), which is derived from the Australian ORANI model and the MONASH model.
To provide an ex post evaluation, we use historical closure and decomposition closure originally from MONASH innovations. Comparisons with other ex ante SARS impact assessments are also provided. Results indicate that only a few industries like medicines, medical health services and precision instruments benefited from SARS, while almost all other industries in Taiwan suffered with output losses as well as employment and welfare reductions. Loss to gross domestic product (GDP) of Taiwan is estimated to be between 0.84 and 1.61 percent which is much bigger than that predicted by the previous ex ante studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200710-38-1-1-34-a,38.1,2007,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

From Static towards Dynamic Temporal Disaggregation: Monthly Real GDP Estimate of the Industrial Sector for Taiwan,Ruey-Wan Liou,"Temporal disaggregation, Temporal aggregation","This paper reviews ten kinds of universally applied temporal disaggregation methods. These ten methods can be classified into three categories. The first uses the unique information of the low-frequency series during disaggregation, e.g., Boot, Feibes and Lisman (1967); The second requires the help of related high-frequency indicators to disaggregate the low-frequency data, such as Denton (1971), Ginsburgh (1973), Guerrero (1990), Chow and Lin (1971), Fernández (1981), Litterman (1983), Salazar et al. (1997a, 1997b), Santos Silva and Cardoso (2001), etc. The last utilizes the state-space approach like Harvey and Pierse (1984), Harvey (1989), and Moauro and Savio (2005). A crucial aspect worthy of attention is that the traditional static disaggregation method may lead to a heteroscedasticity problem, because the dependent variable is repressed in level form. The major reason is that the logarithms of high-frequency estimates do not add up to the logarithm of their aggregate. Salazar et al.(1997a, 1997b) and Santos Silva and Cardoso (2001) first introduce the dynamic structure linking the indicator variables to the interpoland. Salazar et al. also employ Taylor's approximation to tackle the adding-up obstacle of the logarithm transformation.

Currency Risk Facing Taiwan's Financial Institutions,"Li-Huei Lan, Y. Chris Liao, Luke Lin","Currency risk, Financial institutions","Regulators only require banks to manage their short-term exchange rate risk. A possible reason is that the prevailing capital-market methodology fails to identify the long-term currency exposure. Using operating incomes generated by banks, this paper investigates the impact of fluctuating foreign exchange rates on the values of Taiwanese banking institutions, and decomposes the overall currency exposure into short-term and long-term components. We not only overcome the deficiency of prior studies that have limited success in detecting significant currency exposure, but also measure the magnitude of economic exposure that banks are faced with. In contrast to the capital market approach, the cash flow approach finds that 61.54% of the sample firms have a significant currency exposure, which is more than the percentage documented by prior research. Our results also show that the existence of significant long-term exchange rate risk is prevalent among banking institutions in Taiwan. Furthermore, the US dollar (the currency of a nation which is Taiwan's largest export market) has an opposite effect as opposed to the Japanese Yen (the currency of a nation which is Taiwan's largest source of imports). Our results have policy implications that banking institutions should manage long-term currency exposure.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200710-38-1-127-151-a,38.1,2007,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

Evaluation of the Tai-Decision Rules of the Management Procedure of Total Allowable Catch of Southern Bluefin Tuna,"Chin-Hwa Sun, Cheng-Hong Lin","Southern bluefin tuna, Management procedure, Operating model, Decision rule, Total allowable catch","The Management Procedure of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) was developed since 2000 by the Commission for Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) to conserve and ensure optimum utilization of the global SBT fishery through a transparent mechanism for deciding the global total allowable catch (TAC). According to both the official report of CCSBT for the third Meeting of the Management Procedure Workshop in May 2004, the Age-Structured Population Operating Model (OM) was established by utilizing the harvest data from 1969 to 2000 and was used to simulate the future trajectory reference set of the biomass and total allowable catch (TAC) till 2032. Four candidate decision rules (DR) were selected to decide the appropriate TAC trajectory under various scenarios in order to achieve the recovery target of the biomass. Among the final four candidate decision rules, TAI_03, proposed by Sun (2004), is a CPUE-based DR with a negative built-in feedback component in terms of the theoretical economic consideration of the inverse relationship between price and demand. This study tries to apply the TAI_03 decision rule on the updated Reference Set which is updated by the scientific advisory panel with harvest data until 2003 in February 2005.
This study specifies the TAI_04 decision rule to reduce the inter annual variation of TAC and the TAI_05 to adapt to the short-term, intermediate, and long-term situation in order to take into account both sustainability of resource management and industry operation. The simulation result of the TAI_05 decision rule was compared again with the other three candidate decision rules during the fourth management procedure workshop in 2005.
The simulation results show that the TAI_05 decision rule would adjust TAC gradually for the industry to follow and to reduce the uncertainty in revenue in the short-term and to reduce the risk of resource deterioration and to fulfill the requirement that both the recovery of the biomass and the optimum utilization of the global SBT fishery in order to avoid the economic deadweight loss in the long run.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200707-37-3-55-82-a,37.3,2007,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

We conducted a questionnaire survey about premium-setting behaviour by asking primary-insurance underwriters and actuaries through using three utility elicitation methods. The findings show that the respondents have lower willingness to sell insurance when ambiguity about probability of loss is introduced. However, the respondents would always charge higher premium levels for flood insurance than for normal property insurance, which reveals a behavioral characteristic of risk-aversion. Several factors would highly affect the premium-setting behaviour. These factors consist of the flood risk perception, the flood hazard relief measures from government, and the risk-bearing capacity of the insurer, rather than just probability and expected disaster losses involved.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200703-37-2-75-110-a,37.2,2007,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

A variable representing the foreign worker intensity in each two-digit industry is included in the equations to show how importation of foreign workers affects the occupational choice and wage structure of local workers. The results for these equations are as anticipated and can be summarized as follows. First, the foreign worker intensity tends to be positively associated with the probability that local workers are in unemployment. Second, intensity of foreign workers in each industry reduces the probability that local workers attach themselves to an operative, laboring, or craft job, while increasing the chance of their attaining a professional, technician, associate professional, clerical, service, or sales job.

Special attention is paid on the role of the openness of Mainland China in shaping the Chinese circles trade pattern. The major findings are as follows: (1) Firstly, there existed a trading bloc among the Chinese circle even in the early 1980s, and the bloc phenomenon has become more and more significant, especially in the 1990 and after. This result indicates to some extent that the trade flows within the Chinese circle are far above the normal level implied by their corresponding economic conditions and the geographical relationship. (2) The important role of Hong Kong as an agent in facilitating the trade within the region before 1987 is indirectly confirmed by our empirical findings, that is, the suppressed trade across the Strait in accompanied by above-normal trade intensity within the Chinese circle. (3) The trade flows between Taiwan and the Mainland China were once highly suppressed by the political situation but returned to its normal level after 1988 and exceeded normal in 1995 and after, indicating a growing mutual economic and trade dependency among the Chinese Three. (4) The opening-up policy of China announced in 1979 was indeed ineffective for the first few years, only improving to some extent its trade with Hong Kong and Taiwan.

On the basis of our analysis, we found that, as compared to MEI, the medical price indices computed based on the actual growth rate of earnings in the medical sector, although greater, would not create distortions in the allocation of medical resources and thereby would yield lower welfare costs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=a0000040-200510-36-1-29-80-a,36.1,2005,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

In particular, we investigate three types of asymmetry: deepness, steepness and sharpness. We find that although the non-deep property is overwhelmingly applicable to Taiwan's business cycle Clement and Krolzig's parametric tests strongly reject non-steepness. This evidence for steepness suggests that non-linear models are preferable to linear models in describing Taiwan's business cycles.

International Spillovers and Productivity Growth: A Cross-Economy Comparison,"Yir-Hueih Luh, Kuo-Chen Shih","International spillovers, GDP growth, Cross-economy comparison","Based on the 1980-1997 aggregate economic data for Taiwan, Japan and Korea, this paper intends to identify the linkage between international R&D spillovers and productivity growth. Both domestic R&D and foreign R&D stocks are included in the model to compare their effects on GDP growth. The effect of international spillovers is quantified by two indices. The first spillover index emphasizes the public good nature of spillover. Therefore, all firms are assumed to have identical ability of absorbing R&D spillovers, regardless of their sizes or scales. Applying the notion of international spillovers proposed in Coe and Helpman (1995), the second index calculates foreign R&D capital stock as an import-weighted sum of trade partners' R&D stock. This index is meant to reflect the possibility that an economy receives relatively more knowledge spillovers from economies from which relatively more goods and services are imported. Although international spillovers are found to play a role in explaining the GDP growth of Japan and Korea, our results indicate that, due to the negative effect of foreign R&D efforts on competitiveness of domestic goods and services, knowledge spillovers across geographic boundaries do not help explain the real GDP growth in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=a0000040-200510-36-1-103-130-a,36.1,2005,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
Time-varying Relationship of Price Indexes in Taiwan,"Jin-Lung Lin, Ruey S. Tsay","Time-varying, Taiwan price indexes, Exponential weighting into the past, Parameter bootstrapping, Stability","Price indexes are important variables in macroeconomic models. They are composed to measure various costs in an economy. For instance, a Consumer Price Index (CPI) is constructed to measure the cost of living and a Wholesale Price Index (WPI) summarizes the prices of transactions between enterprises and is intended as a measure of production cost. The price indexes of an economy are highly correlated via economic theory and index composition. The relationship is often treated as stable over time in macroeconomic modeling. In this paper we consider four monthly price indexes of Taiwan, namely the CPI, WPI, Export Price Index (PEX), and Import Price Index (PM). Our goal is to investigate the stability of the relationship between these indexes. We employ various methods, including exponentially weighted recursive least squares and parametric bootstrap methods, to show that, for Taiwan is Economy, the relationship is time-varying for the CPI and WPI. For the export price index (PEX), we found that the relationship is relatively stable after adjusting for the impact of exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen versus New Taiwan Dollar. Macroeconomic modelers should be cautioned about the time-varying relationship of price variables, and nonlinear models deserve further investigation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=a0000040-200503-35-2-1-22-a,35.2,2005,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
The New Taiwan Dollar Exchange Rate and Central Bank Intervention,"Ya-Hwei Yang, Jia-Dong Shea","Intervention of Central Bank, Exchange Rate","The intervention of the Central Bank into the foreign exchange market is invariably undertaken based on policy objective considerations, and the influence that is brought to bear by such intervention is often far too significant to be ignored. This paper sets out to establish a model of optimal Central Bank behavior, under policy objective considerations, in an attempt to explain the determination of the New Taiwan Dollar exchange rate.
Our empirical study finds that the comparative prices and interest differences between domestic and foreign countries, and the exchange rate trends within neighboring countries such as Japan and South Korea, play significant roles in influencing the exchange rate trend of the New Taiwan Dollar. In addition to the market mechanism, major policy considerations, such as domestic price stabilization, stimulation of the economy and exchange rate stabilization, have driven the Central Bank to undertake significant intervention into the market.
Other comparative empirical studies have shown that a model which includes government intervention is far better, both in terms of explanatory power and forecasting power, than a model which excludes government intervention.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=a0000040-200503-35-2-23-41-a,35.2,2005,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

On account of this yet to be fully explored area, this article examines a crucial part of these linkages by looking at the industry-level national income accounts for Taiwan and the U.S.. Adopting the Standard Industry Classification System of Taiwan (1996) and the U.S. (1972 & 1987), we assembled annual data for 9 two-digit and 24 three-digit sectoral outputs over a 20-year period from 1981 to 2000. The empirical results support the following conclusions: (1) Taiwanese manufacturing and transportation/communications outputs are strongly correlated with corresponding U.S. sectors. For manufacturing, links arise in electric and electronic equipment, instruments and related products (EIRP), and petroleum products; for transportion/communications (T/C) they arise in warehousing and communications. These sectors account for about 40 per cent of Taiwan's private-sector output. (2) The growth in the aforementioned sectoral outputs is more related to the forces of their U.S. counterparts than with overall growth of Taiwan. (3) The error-correction regression analysis establishes: (i) Long-run fundamental cross-country sectoral linkages in EIRP and T/C; (ii) Long-run fundamental cross-country aggregate linkages in manufacturing, EIRP, and T/C; (iii) The manifestation of short-run, transitory effects of changes in sectoral or aggregate output on particular Taiwanese industries, including manufacturing, petroleum products, EIRP, and T/C.

Product Life Cycle and Industrial Hollowing-Out - an Empirical Study of the Electric and Electronics Industry of Taiwan,"Tzu-Han Yang, Joanne Y. Liao","Product life cycle, Industrial hollowing-out, Foreign direct investment","This paper investigates whether the huge size of overseas direct investment of Taiwan’s electric and electronics industry in the 1990s has caused its hollowing-out. According to Vernon’s product life cycle theory, with the maturity of production technology, the production site of a product will move from where it is innovated, first to other developed countries, and then to developing countries. It also implies that the product content of an industry in a particular country will continue to change. If the product turnover of the industry slows down, it may indicate that hollowing-out has occurred. The product turnover index and the product mix index are computed for Taiwan’s electric and electronics industry by applying the index model developed from a CES import function in Feenstra et al. (1999). The former is to measure the rate of entering new product areas in terms of dropping out of old products; and the latter is to measure the product structure change. We find that compared with product turnover in the 1980s, a period with large inward foreign direct investment, the hollowing-out effect does not seem to appear in the 1990s for the industry.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=a0000040-200410-35-1-65-89-a,35.1,2004,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

First, the classical regression model and the random-effects model tend to fit somewhat better the data on numbers of interpellation sessions held on issues concerning nursing care and other general services for the elderly, respectively. In another way, the fixed-effects model would be more appropriate for the data on numbers of interpellation sessions held on issues concerning medical care, long-term care, allowances or subsidies, and retirement pensions for the elderly. Second, the number of interpellation sessions held by the legislators of any individual political party for each issue concerning the elderly is highly correlated with the electoral cycle and thus

Finally, this paper shows that the VAR model can be used to test the spillover effect using the Granger-causality test and impulse response function.

Four different designs are proposed. The results show different impacts in the short run and long run. In general, the four designs generate negative effects on real output in the early stage, but positive ones in the later period. Among them, the result of B-8 has the biggest influence. Because the employers have to bear a certain degree of the retirement pensions, any change will cause production costs to increase, and consequently depress their investment. Therefore, negative effects will show on both investment and production. On the other hand, laborers can only receive a small portion of their pensions in the early stage. As a result, in the short run, the positive effect from the retirement pensions cannot offset the negative one from the contraction in the private sector.

In order to follow the trends in the movement of exports in advance, export orders have long been used as important leading indicators of actual exports by researchers and government officials alike. However, in recent years the gap between export orders and actual exports has continuously broadened. Since production overseas has become more and more of a widespread practice among Taiwan firms, economists have often accounted for the widening gaps between export orders and exports by pointing out that overseas production has been increasing. Are export orders really valid and reliable leading indicators of exports? Can the gaps between export orders and exports justifiably be attributed to increasing overseas production? The empirical results clearly demonstrate that export orders and exports have a contemporaneous relationship.

Alternative Approach toward Rice Import Liberalization,Shun-Yi Shei,"paddy and upland fields utilization adjustment program, tariffication, income compensation scheme","The paddy and upland fields utilization adjustment program, similar to commonly known land set aside program, was revised and extended to year 2004 in order to cope with the challenge of rice import as Taiwan becomes a member of WTO. This adjustment program deals mainly with the short term rice price stabilization issue and ignores its detrimental long term consequences. One rationale for not considering alternative approaches might be simply because useful knowledge on the long term gains of alternative programs are lacking. This short article addresses one of the alternative approaches, the tariffication of rice import, in dealing with Taiwan’s rice import liberalization issue. The paper discusses the scenario of a series of tariff reductions and evaluates its impacts on rice price, government expenditure and tariff revenue. Tariffication will incur substantial income loss to rice farmers and the tax payers are expected to share some of the loss. Therefore, the paper proposes an income compensation scheme which includes direct and indirect subsidies to rice commodity, land subsidy based on resource and environment contribution to the society, and farm wage subsidy based on farmer's age and ability to adjust. This scheme costs 19.1billion NT dollars in the first year, roughly equals to the amount of current rice programs, and falls subsequently to 10.6 billions after 15 years. The downward adjustments of rice price as well as farm land rent in the processes of tariffication and tariff reductions provide an opportunity for farm consolidation and enlargement, and enhance long term competitiveness of rice production.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200303-33-1-25-40-a,33.1,2003,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

An Analysis of Taiwan's International Trade from the Prospective of Vertical Specialization,Hung-Yi Chen,"International Production, Vertical Specialization, and Input-output Tables","The nature of international trade changes dramatically in last few decades. Production sequence of a good involves several countries, with each country specializing in particular stages of a good's production. These vertical linkages referring to imported inputs are used to produce goods that are then exported are called vertical specialization. Using the input-output table, this paper estimates Taiwan's vertical specialization in trade and the accompanying changes in the structure of industries from the selected years of 1964 to 1994 for country level and industry level. Key findings and implications are presented as follows. (1) The degree of total VS share of export was 48.32% in 1981 and 69.05% in1996, a 42.9% increase in two decades. This implies that a significant portion of international trade in the last two decades has been following the trend of the world trade in moving toward the pattern of global production sharing. (2) Noteworthy is the manufacturing sector, whose VS share of exports has been steadily increasing and has accounted for more than 90% of the total VS shares of exports. (3) The effect of tariffs on trade verticality in our econometric analysis is statistically significant and negative. This suggests that trade liberalization through tariff reduction tends to modify the pattern of international production toward vertical specialization.

The Transition of and Lessons from Taiwan's Family Planning Program,"T.H. Sun, C.N. Chen, T.M. Lee","family planning, fertility, cost-benefit, evaluation","This paper serves two purposes. One is to record activities of Taiwan's family planning program in the final transitional stage. It focuses on the modification of operation and evaluation approaches that are implemented in this stage and the analysis of the cost-benefit. The other purpose is to review what lessons have been learned from the three stages of Taiwan's family planning program.
The major accomplishments of Taiwan's family planning program in its final transitional stage are as follows:
1. To achieve the goal of slowing down population growth. By 1984, Taiwan's NRR was already below the replacement level. In other words, Taiwan's population will stop increasing in the next several decades.
2. Both the rate of contraceptive practice and the proportion of aiming for birth spacing for young women have drastically increased. In addition, the rate of those who have used contraceptives has also increased substantially.
3. The effect of human capital input has largely increased to 1.74 births per working day. It is about 1.6 times greater than the effect from its previous stage.
4. The increasing effectiveness of human capital input has led to the decrease in cost for birth prevention (in terms of 1986 prices or cumulative cost).
5. The contraceptive practice rate has almost reached the goal of a complete contraceptive society.
6. The fertility rate of the age-group 20-24 has substantially decreased. The proportion of first and second births accounts for 78.7% of total births.
Six lessons have been learned from Taiwan's family planning program, finding:
1. A critical evaluation on existing fertility theories.
2. The interaction between evaluation and research activities and family planning promotion strategies.
3. How to break the taboo, resulting in the formation and promulgation of family planning policy.
4. The critical factors for a successful family planning campaign.
5. The social-economic influence of a successful family planning program.
6. Life cycle stages of a successful social policy.
Items 1 and 2 focus on proposing important administrative factors beyond current literature. Items 3, 4, and 5 are the induction of successful program implementation factors. Item 6 proposes a new theory on public policy based on Taiwan's family planning program.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200203-32-1-25-76-a,32.1,2002,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy
The Building and Application of the Current Quarterly Model (CQM) for Taiwan,"Su-Ling Peng, Ji Chou","current quarterly model CQM, macroecometric model, forecasting, bridge equation, principal component","The increased interaction between international and domestic economic activities along with the ease of access to information have made changes in the economy more rapid and complicated, whilst also making economic forecasting more difficult than ever. The only real way to deal with the problem is to grasp and analyze current changes promptly, revising forecasts as necessary. Therefore, the collection and utilization of high frequency data to improve low frequency forecasts has become an important issue in recent forecasting literature. Our study is based on this trend and follows Nobel laureate, Lawrence Klein's approach to the construction of a Current Quarterly Model (CQM) for Taiwan.
The CQM model predicts quarterly GDP growth from the GDP expenditure side and from the approach of principal components. On the expenditure side, we build Bridge equations for NIPA (which includes private consumption, private investment, government sector and exports imports) and the high frequency leading indicators. In the principal components approach, we abstract some leading indicators to predict the nominal GDP, real GDP and GDP deflator. We then average out the predicted values to obtain the final forecasting results.
The purposes of the CQM are to obtain the initial predicted values as a benchmark, and to add factors for a traditional macroeconometric model in order to improve the forecast results, which should then enable us to release the latest GDP growth forecast and utilize recent developments in information networks within the international institutes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17298849-200203-32-1-77-116-a,32.1,2002,Taiwan Economic Forecast and Policy

In this paper, we adopt the Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS) developed by George and McCulloch (1993) to identify the crisis predictors. By using Gibbs sampler to simulate a correlated sample and ”best model” is identified as the one with highest frequency in the sample. Empirical results show that annual growth rate of money supply, M2, and the ratio of government debt to GDP are promising predictors for financial crisis. Somewhat surprisingly the frequently mention factors in recent literatures, such as ratio of total foreign reserve to GDP and the ratio of trade balance to GDP are not selected by our analysis.

Our findings show that the housing wealth effect is heterogeneous across areas, and that the response of consumption to expected changes in housing prices in Taipei city is significant for the expenditure on entertainment services. For the response of consumption to unexpected changes in housing prices, we present the positive effect in Taichung and Kaohsiung cities for most consumption goods, while it is negative in Taipei and New Taipei cities for the expenditure on transportation and entertainment services.

The sample consists of TWSE and OTC companies that won the Corporate Citizenship Award of Commonwealth Magazine from 2010 to 2019 as well as non-winning companies obtained by the propensity score matching. We use the moral and ethical hypothesis to explain the mutual negative influence between CSR performance and the degree of tax avoidance along with the cost compensation as well as the image compensation hypotheses to explain their mutual positive effect. CSR performance and tax avoidance are measured by the corporate citizenship award score and book-tax differences, respectively. The empirical results show the following. 1) CSR and tax avoidance exhibit causality to each other. 2) CSR performance positively affects its tax avoidance, and thus the cost compensation hypothesis holds. 3) The degree of tax avoidance positively affects CSR performance, supporting the image compensation hypothesis. 4) Product market competition reduces the phenomenon of cost compensation and enhances the behavior of image compensation. Some robustness checks are executed, including the next-period CSR explained by the previous tax avoidance behaviors, the CSR performance as measured by the indicator variable for whether awards are granted or not, and the degree of tax avoidance as measured by residual book-tax differences.

We present the income effect in a mechanism of an agglomeration economy and focus the analysis on two issues. First, what are the impacts of land rent on the spatial structure under different assumptions? Second, what are the differences between the optimal spatial allocation and the market equilibrium? We then compare our findings with the results of Pflüger and Südekum (2008), with the main conclusions as follows. (1) When trade freeness is high, the social optimum of Forslid and Ottaviano (2003) is agglomeration, but our study exhibits dispersion. (2) Unlike Pflüger and Südekum (2008) in which ＂over-agglomeration＂ (market equilibrium versus social optimum) is the only case during low trade freeness, our study finds that ＂under-agglomeration＂ may also occur in low housing preference and low elasticity of substitution for differential goods.

Our research results suggest that compared to other industries, R&D investment in the tertiary industry has the largest influence on its total factor productivity, and this industry also receives the greatest R&D spillover benefit from other industries. According to our simulation results, government R&D investment into the ICT industry could foster economic momentum, private investment, as well as increased tax revenue. Moreover, labor productivity in all industries will be enhanced by such government R&D investment, resulting in an increase in the relative price of labor over capital.

We interpret this trend by using a simple static model, which takes the view that college graduates are pursuing better salaries and indicates that the key lies in surging number of college graduates in this period that creates fiercer competition in the college-level labor market and hence depressing college-level salaries. To earn a better salary, more college graduates therefore choose to enter master's programs after graduation, thus creating the growth in those pursuing this higher-level degree.

Does Corporate Social Responsibility Have the Function of Insurance on Performance?,"Hao-Yu Hung, Yuan Chang, Shu-Hui Lin","Corporate Social Responsibility, Insurance","This study examines whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) has the function of mitigating a decline in performance when facing overall negative events and individual negative events - that is, whether CSR is like a form of insurance on performance. Firms engaging in CSR are able to establish and accumulate both trust and a positive reputation among the general public. When negative events occur, the trust and reputation established through CSR serve as a buffer against the impacts of those events, and the negative impacts on a firm will be relatively slight. Based on data of 1,484 listed non-financial firms on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) and the Taipei Exchange (TPEx) from 2005 to 2015 and through correlation analysis and regression estimation, this study finds when firms confront overall negative events and firm-specific negative events that their performance and value tend to decline, while profit volatility increases. Interestingly, those with better CSR performance present a relatively small decline in performance and a relatively low increase in profit volatility, confirming that CSR does play a function like insurance on performance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-202201-202203110010-202203110010-135-217,58.1,2022,Taipei Economic Inquiry

When estimating a production function, Olley and Pakes (1996) suggest jointly solving two problems - i.e., selection and simultaneity - to obtain consistent parameter estimates. Our research ignores the selection problem, because there are few tourist hotels leaving the market during the sample period, and merely takes the simultaneity problem into account. We thus propose to jointly estimate two production frontiers for Taiwan's tourist hotels, corresponding to accommodation and restaurant divisions, using the copula methods. After considering the simultaneity problem, we find that the average technical efficiency of both divisions increases, the management ability of the restaurant division exceeds that of the accommodation division, chained hotels outperform independent hotels, the average efficiency of the sample hotels before and after 2008 (the subprime crisis) remains the same, and the data do not support the quiet life hypothesis.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-202107-202110080011-202110080011-173-210,57.2,2021,Taipei Economic Inquiry

Second, if the profit sharing and tax evasion benefits of the subsidiary manager are greater (less) than the profit-sharing benefits of the subsidiary manager who does not conceal corporate income, then MNEs can charge a higher (lower) amount of the lump-sum transfer. Third, if the percentage of liability for tax evasion by the subsidiary manager increases (decreases), then MNEs can increase (decrease) the bonus ratios when the direction of transfer pricing is undetermined.

The study examines the dietary behavior of Taiwan's working-age population to explore the relationship between nutrition knowledge and dietary quality as well as other influencing factors. Considering the endogeneity of nutrition knowledge, we adopt instrumental variables and two-stage estimation to understand the effect of nutrition knowledge and other factors. The results show that over 50% of the population surveyed have an inadequate intake of vegetables, fruits, eggs, beans, fish, and meat, whereas over 80% are found to have an inadequate intake of dairy products. The subjects with more adequate nutrition knowledge are more likely to consume appropriate amounts of dairy products as well as fruits.

The Analysis of Key Factors Affecting the Successful Funding Amounts of Crowdfunding,"Jauling Tseng, Nai-Fong Kuo, Hsueh-Hung Hou","Crowdfunding, Fintech, E-commerce, Wireless Broadband, Sample Selection Model","Few studies have properly discussed factors that affect how crowdfunding platforms successfully meet their fundraising targets. This research thus examines the effects of the conditions and factors related to crowdfunding platforms and then analyzes the effects of the macroeconomic, financial, and consumption variables as well as technological environment variables on the successful probability of crowdfunding and the amount of money successfully raised by employing statistical data from Taiwanese crowdfunding platforms flyingV and ditfunding. The empirical results reveal that crowdfunding platforms with lower funding targets, more backers, more comments, more frequent updates, and more successful or fewer failure experiences are significantly more likely to succeed; and that platforms with higher funding targets, more backers, more frequent updates, and more successful or fewer failure experiences are significantly more likely to increase funds raised. A significant and negative association is observed between loans from all banks and the probability of successful crowdfunding; in other words, lower total bank loans prompt more successful crowdfunding. Additionally, a significant and positive correlation is observed between the interbank overnight call loan rate and the probability of successful crowdfunding. This intuitively suggests that higher overnight rates result in higher bank operation and credit costs, which increase the probability of successful crowdfunding. Taiwan's gross national consumption and consumer price index exhibit a significantly negative and positive correlation with the amount of funds successfully raised, respectively. This implies that when gross national consumption is lower or when price levels are higher, the amount successfully raised through crowdfunding increases. Finally, because crowdfunding is a type of e-commerce, more wireless broadband accounts in Taiwan, indicating more frequent digital transmissions and higher penetration rates, raise the probability of successful crowdfunding and the amount of funds successfully raised. However, increases in cell phone numbers alone enhance the transmission of non-digital information and thus do not increase the amount of funds raised.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-202107-202110080011-202110080011-297-359,57.2,2021,Taipei Economic Inquiry

From courses' perspective, those with a higher fail ratio or low average score have a higher withdrawal ratio, yet withdrawals responded to the fail ratio and average score differently. All students are sensitive to score, but only marginal students are concerned about passing the courses or not. Courses of more than two credits are more likely to be withdrawn, reflecting the consideration of costs and benefits. The instant benefits of withdrawals include saving time, enhancing grade point average, and avoiding dismissal, while the future costs are late graduation. Instant benefits are clearly greater than future costs. Students must retake required courses after withdrawal. Students who took an academic year course and pass in the first semester knew how to pass the course in the second semester. Consequently, required courses and second-semester courses are less likely to be withdrawn. From students' perspective, those with good grades and without a record of failing a one-half credit course are less likely to withdraw. Females and recommendation/multi-star students are less likely to withdraw. Withdrawal is a correction of the courses taken in the first place, which probably reflects that females and recommendation/multi-star students are more thoughtful than their countpartners, as they seldom take courses on an impulse. Seniors and freshmen are less likely to withdraw, which might suggest that seniors have abundant experience at taking courses and are more able to evaluate their own capability and to control their time. The low withdrawal of freshmen might result from knowing little about the rule of withdrawal or overestimating themselves.

This paper thus focuses on Shih Hsin University and uses 2005-2015 institutional data, which are linked to the regulations of these three screening mechanisms, to distinguish between the influences of matching methods (i.e., assignment algorithm) and selection criteria (i.e., a basis for preferences of colleges over students) on a student's standardized scores and his/her intent to change a major or leave an institution in the first and second years of schoolong. By recognizing the fact that Shih Hsin University is well-known for its college of journalism and communications, we are able to solve the lack of preferences of students in the field of institutional research. The empirical results suggest that the assignment algorithm used for admission via Personal Application and via the Star Plan can significantly attract students with high standardized scores, when compared with an admission via the Joint College Assigned-Subject Examination, at the cost of high intention to change majors.

In addition, the immediate effect of a pension cut on working hours depends on the magnitude of the reform, and the increase in working hours was most significant three years following the reform.

This research argues that even if price discrimination reduces welfare in some parameter ranges, its validity may still be defensible. When oligopoly firms engage in quantity competition, then relative to price discrimination, uniform pricing is no longer a dominated strategy, because when a firm employs uniform pricing, it aggregates its demand in two separate markets so as to choose its optimal uniform price. Thus, it is able to extend its monopoly power from the market where it is a monopoly to the other market where it faces Cournot competition. Consequently, uniform pricing may be preferred over price discrimination. If a profit-maximizing firm's choice, whether it is price discrimination or uniform pricing, always results in lower social welfare than the other pricing strategy that is not chosen, then price discrimination should not be less defensible than uniform pricing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-202007-202009010023-202009010023-163-192,56.2,2020,Taipei Economic Inquiry

Why Do Hospitals and Clinics in Taiwan Not Release Prescriptions? An Explanation of the Pharmaceutical Price Gap,"Chien-Yuan Sher, Ming-Chen Chen","Separation of Dispensing and Prescribing, Prescription, Pharmaceutical Price Gap, National Health Insurance Research Database","Although the policy regarding the separation of dispensing and prescribing drugs has been in force since 1990s, the authorities in Taiwan have not yet enacted rules requiring hospitals or clinics to release prescriptions, which a patient can take to the pharmacy to get the filling, as for many years, the government has relied on only physicians' voluntary cooperation to realize this policy. In order to help motivate physicians to release more prescriptions, this study examines their behavior and discusses how the profit from the pharmaceutical price gap (whereby the pharmaceutical reimbursement by National Health Insurance is higher than the actual expenditure) affects physicians' willingness to release prescriptions. Based on the National Health Insurance Research Database, we analyze clinic records in 2008 and 2010, compare them with information of the 6^(th) and 7^(th) adjustments in the pharmaceutical reimbursement schedule, and estimate the profit from the pharmaceutical price gap in each clinic record. The findings show that physicians statistically significantly tend to keep prescriptions, including for drugs whose reimbursement prices have been reduced in the two adjustments or for prescriptions with higher drug reimbursement. This implies that physicians do consider pharmaceutical profit when prescribing. It also means that if the government can amend the reimbursement policy that is causing the pharmaceutical price gap, then physicians will release more prescriptions to pharmacists.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-202001-202003030015-202003030015-79-114,56.1,2020,Taipei Economic Inquiry

With our sample spanning from 2007 to 2015, the results are as follows. First, the guarantees enhance the effect of credit ratings. Second, credit ratings still explain bond yield spreads even though the rating inflation phenomenon is popular in China. Third, investors demand higher risk premiums for bonds with guarantees versus similar bonds without guarantees. This evidence is more pronounced when the guarantors are local state-owned enterprises (SOEs) or specialized guarantee corporations than other types of firms.

We utilize new econometric methods and data sources to examine whether changes in labor income inequality are attributable to workers' education years, working experience, gender, marital status, public or private sector employment, and industry sectors. The results suggest that more schooling years and larger marginal rates of return to education lead to increases in an individual's labor income, especially for low- and middle-income workers. Changes in returns to different industry sectors show that industrial structure adjustments arising from the 2008-2009 global financial tsunami may have an adverse effect on low-income labors. Other factors that affect wage inequality are secondary. The results therefore imply that governments can reduce labor income inequality through education subsidies and on-the-job trainings for the disadvantageous workers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201907-201908300006-201908300006-147-190,55.2,2019,Taipei Economic Inquiry

Mussa (1976) proposed that about 90% of fluctuations in exchange rates are due to unexpected news. Therefore, this study presents the two-stage TREE/LOGIT model to identify which indices with thresholds lead to such short-period reversals. The first stage applies a decision TREE algorithm to determine the possible threshold difference between the forecast index and the announced one that correlates to the reversal. The next stage makes use of the LOGIT model with thresholds to quantify the statistical significance of a combined set of indices as the optimal predictor of a reversal. With this model we analyze each of the five major currencies exchanges rates, for before and after the u.s. subprime mortgage crisis in 2007, and identify the relevant indices that precede a reversal under different investment risk aversions. We conclude that the category of economic growth indices is the primary factor for predicting an exchange rate reversal, either before or after the crisis, for all the currencies in our study.

(2) Deregulation in the goods market raises total social welfare regardless of which future generations exist in the overlapping-generations model. (3) The welfare benefit of deregulation for the infinitely-lived agent is larger compared the overlapping-generations model that only contains current generations.

After establishing the co-integration, we proceed to show whether the co-integration relationship changes across quantiles, depending on the size and sign of the shocks that hit the fiscal variables. As such, the framework can help us to distinguish whether a country exhibits strong-form or weak-form fiscal sustainability. Our results suggest that there exists a long-run relationship between the two series for all eleven countries in a quantile sense, implying fiscal sustainability holds for these countries. However, the forms of fiscal sustainability are different over various quantiles and for these countries. For five countries, the relationship shows an asymmetric pattern over different quantiles, depending on the size and sign of the shocks, whereby under lower quantiles negative shocks with large absolute values tend to weaken the relationship (less than one), and thus they have weak-form fiscal sustainability; in the upper quantiles, large positive shocks do not weaken this relationship, and thus these countries have strong-form fiscal sustainability. This research provides possible explanations for these results. Finally, strong-form sustainability holds over all quantiles for three countries, while two of the 11 countries show weak-form sustainability.

To explore the roles played the shadow economy in this correlation, we first estimate the size of said economy in Taiwan and then employ the cointegration model to investigate whether or not the presence of this type of economy significantly alters the correlation between financial development (including banking and stock markets) and economic growth in Taiwan. We proceed with our investigations by comparing two models. The first one examines the correlation between financial development and economic growth, without considering the shadow economy. We then compare this to the second one, which explores the correlations among financial development, the official economy, and the shadow economy. We find that whether the shadow economy is present or not plays an important role in determining the finance-growth nexus of Taiwan.

Macroeconomic Parameters and the Assignment Problem,"Tien-Wang Tsaur, Jen-Ruey Tsaur, Yen-Ching Lin","Assignment Problem, Macroeconomic Parameters, Dynamic Stability","Caves and Jones (1973) employ the Swan diagram to illustrate the assignment problem and suggest that the slope of the external-balance schedule being flatter than the internal-balance schedule implies higher relative effectiveness of exchange-rate (government expenditure) changes for securing an external (internal) balance. Chen (1977) further demonstrates that Caves and Jones' proposition is valid if and only if the size of the marginal propensity to import falls short of one half. This clear result of Chen (1977) comes from the robust assumption that the output is fixed at the full-employment level. This present research assumes that, unless the economy is lying on the internal-balance schedule, the output is capable of influencing the trade balance. We therefore show that the relative magnitude between the marginal propensity to import and the marginal propensity to save is crucial in determining the policy assignment. More specifically, if the size of the marginal propensity to import is smaller (larger) than the size of the marginal propensity to save, then an exchange-rate policy should be set up to secure the external (internal) balance and a proper fiscal policy should be executed to secure the internal (external) balance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201901-201902220011-201902220011-115-146,55.1,2019,Taipei Economic Inquiry

Our empirical results show that men tend to adopt the mode of ＂sequential decision＂ and married women tend to adopt the mode of ＂two-stage decision＂. Furthermore, an older person, a married man, and a higher educated person have a greater possibility of choosing a full-time typical job. A younger person tends to choose a full-time atypical job, however, the probability of choosing a part-time job has no monotonic correlation with age. An increase in the number of family members decreases the possibility of choosing a part-time job for men, but encourages married women to participate in the secondary labor market (i.e. a part-time job).

The Impact of Managerial Ownership on Firm Value: The Role of Overconfidence,"Liu, Yong-Chin, Hsiang-Ju Chen, Sheng-Wen Chen","Managerial Ownership, Overconfidence, Convergence of Interests Hypothesis, Entrenchment Hypothesis, Corporate Governance","This article examines whether managerial overconfidence alters the impact of managerial ownership on firm value. With a sample encompassing annual data of Taiwan's listed and OTC companies for the period 1997-2014 and using Tobin's Q as firm value, the results from regression analyses indicate that under the situation of no overconfidence by managers, the effect of managerial ownership on firm value follows a U-shaped pattern, but there is a positive-slope linearity if squared ownership is not considered. However, if managers are overconfident, then ownership value exhibits either an inverse U-shaped curve or an insignificant relationship. The results are unchanged even after iterations with four indicators for managerial overconfidence and by considering the endogeneity of both ownership and overconfidence. Moreover, when managers have low ownership, their overconfidence does not make a significant difference in firm value, because it has limited harm on any relatively low value. Therefore, the hypothesis of convergence of interests for managers and shareholders and the overconfidence hypothesis both hold, but the entrenchment hypothesis does not. This article also uncovers one reason, related to improper investments, for why managers with high ownership and overconfidence fail to raise firm values due to the relatively high sensitivity of cash flows to investments.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201807-201808310014-201808310014-191-242,54.2,2018,Taipei Economic Inquiry
The Effects of Trade and Overseas Production of Taiwan's Export Orders on the Performance of Taiwan's Manufacturing Industries: A Comparison between Trade with Different Regions,"Tsai, I-Ju","Trade, Overseas Production of Export Orders, Factor Mobility, Employment, Number of Establishments, Real Wages","This paper uses Taiwan's Industry, Commerce and Service Censuses of 2006 and 2011 and trade statistics to analyze the impact of cross-strait trade, its trade with regions other than mainland China and Hong Kong (other regions hereinafter), and overseas production of Taiwan's export orders (OPEO) on the performance of the country's four-digit manufacturing industries. The empirical findings are that a one percentage point increase in exports to China (including mainland China and Hong Kong) and other regions raises employment across industries by 0.07 and 0.14 percentage points, respectively. The estimate suggests annual employment increases of 4,801 and 9,951 workers stemming from the growth in exports to China and other regions over the period 2006-2011, respectively, accounting for 89% of the actual annual total increment in employment. Furthermore, a one percentage point increase in exports to other regions results in a 0.13 percentage point rise in the number of establishment units. The growth in exports to other regions prompts an increase in the number of establishment units by 368, accounting for 41% of actual annual incremental growth. However, Taiwan's exports to China have no significant effect on the increases in the number of establishment units and Taiwan's imports from China incur no significant changes in employment, the number of establishments and real wages in Taiwan. The larger creation in Taiwan's employment and establishments brought about by exports to other regions than that to China suggests that the relative importance of trade-induced effects are subject to factor mobility between trade partners. Additionally, although a one percentage point increase in OPEO leads to a slight 0.012 percentage points increase annually in average real wages during the same period, the long-run accumulated effect of overseas production is negative, i.e., an increased ratio of overseas production in mainland China to an industry's exports results in a decrease in the number of establishments in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201807-201808310014-201808310014-243-286,54.2,2018,Taipei Economic Inquiry

The results of this paper show that raising the property tax rate has a significant negative effect on housing prices, whereas the imposition of a stamp fee and increasing the risk weights for mortgages do not impact housing prices in Taiwan. Moreover, tightening targeted credit policies, including lowering the maximum LTV and DTI ratios, can cause housing prices in Taiwan to fall.

In particular, we employ a simple Hotelling (1929) model to endogenize the behaviors of dog/cat purchasers and adopters and show that the regulator may tax or subsidize pet-animal buyers if it aims to maximize social welfare in an imperfectly competitive pet-animal market. On the other hand, taxing pet-animal buyers is the regulator's best choice in a perfectly competitive pet-animal market. These results hold under both linear and quadratic breeding-cost and strays' environmental-damage functions. By contrast, when the regulator is targeting to minimize the number of stray animals, taxing dog/cat buyers is the best choice.

By comparing the results from these two types of efficiency estimation, we find that the efforts by European countries in recent years have paid off, which is different from results in the past literature. This study employs a spatial quantile regression model to analyze the factors affecting the efficiency of national production. The model solves the problem of data exhibiting spatial correlation and heterogeneity and therefore avoids biased estimations. We show that the degree of corruption affecting high production efficiency countries is more significant, that foreign direct investment has a significant effect for less efficient countries, and that trade might have a negative impact for highly productive countries. By considering undesirable output, when spatial correlation does exist, the least efficient countries do not get the benefits through technology spillover from adjacent countries. The extent of corruption influences highly productive countries more negatively than inefficient countries, because the high degree of corruption in higher productive countries allows for an increase in carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, the least productive countries no longer benefit from foreign direct investment. Finally, we note that an increase in trade likely leads to lower production efficiency in less efficient countries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201801-201804190015-201804190015-29-71,54.1,2018,Taipei Economic Inquiry

The Study of Optimal Electricity Portfolio Planning under Risk and Uncertainty,"Wang, King-Min, Ting-Wei Kuo, Tzu-Hsun Hsiao, Yo-Min Lin","Generation Mix, Portfolio Theory, Renewable Energy, Mean-Variance Analysis","Fossil fuel price volatility is one of the key factors impacting energy security. Taiwan relies upon imported energy for more than 90% of its total energy usage, making it highly vulnerable and deeply influenced by the uncertainty of international fuel markets. Therefore, Taiwan's energy investment decision is confronted with risk from fossil fuel prices. To understand how to set up electricity portfolio planning under risk and uncertainty, this study adopts a Mean-Variance Analysis of portfolio theory and employs the expected utility theorem to explore the optimal electricity portfolio for Taipower Company, the resultant expected return and risk of the generation system, and the condition of CO_2 emissions. The results indicate that, under the case without renewables, using more nuclear energy in the portfolio can increase the expected return, but at a cost of slightly higher risk. In the case with renewables added, the results demonstrate that using more renewable energies has the advantage of hedging against the fuel price risk while maintaining the same expected return level. Therefore, if generation efficiency and cost of renewables can be improved by technological progress, then the return of the electricity portfolio can be increased and CO_2 emissions can be mitigated significantly. Our study contributes to the risk management of electricity portfolio planning and to the advantages of employing renewables in the energy generation mix. However, the risk matter in the study is limited to the fossil fuel price risk in financial markets. This is not total energy risk as related to the conventional concept of energy security, but it should be taken into consideration by a multi-dimensional analysis in a future study.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201707-201710160005-201710160005-225-259,53.2,2017,Taipei Economic Inquiry

First, if the goods are complements, or if the goods are substitutes and the weight of consumer surplus (the fraction of domestic consumers) is greater than the degree of product substitutability, then choosing price is the dominant strategy for each firm. Second, if the goods are substitutes and the weight of consumer surplus (the fraction of domestic consumers) is less than the degree of product substitutability, then the optimal choice of the two firms will gradually change from the price strategy to the quantity strategy.

We primarily apply the dynamic system GMM estimator to control for time-invariant unobserved industry characteristics, simultaneity issues and dynamics in the adjustment process of productivity. The findings present an effect of overeducation on productivity in big-scale enterprises and for young workers.

Our findings show that the amount of aggregate profits generated after forward or backward integration is based on the number of intermediate goods firms in relation to the number of final goods firms. In addition, when the firms engage in forward integration, the R&D activities will lead to ambiguous results according to the degree of competition in the final goods markets. If the final goods market is more imperfectly competitive, there will be too little R&D activity at the market equilibrium. Since the market equilibrium economic growth rate is lower than the socially optimal economic growth rate, the government should implement a subsidy policy so as to increase economic growth. On the other hand, if the final goods market is perfectly competitive, then there is too much R&D activity, and the government should implement a tax policy to boost economic growth. Lastly, the government can enforce the optimal subsidy/tax rate to increase the welfare of balanced growth equilibrium to the level of social optimum.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201701-201703280012-201703280012-51-85,53.1,2017,Taipei Economic Inquiry

By incorporating into the model the properties of common-pool resources to which the tourism activities are linked, we prove that ecotourism does not guarantee sustainable development for a rural area unless it is accompanied by suitable policies of reducing firm numbers and/or the levying of a tourist tax. More specifically, we find two stable equilibria: one characterized by low or even a zero level of natural resources, and the other has a high level of natural resources. In low equilibrium, the extinction or zero stock of natural resources occurs under open access of zero transport cost and marginal environmental maintenance cost. High equilibrium corresponds to greater social welfare, which can be guaranteed through policies of a tourist tax, license fee, limiting the number of firms, and restrictions on the population of potential tourists. More importantly, we prove that although high equilibrium is better than low equilibrium, it may not be socially optimal. The maximum welfare can only be achieved by a direct tax on tourists and not solely by policies controlling the number of firms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201701-201703280012-201703280012-87-128,53.1,2017,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Dynamic Factors Volatility and Expected Stock Return Based on the Unscented Kalman Filter Method and GARCH Model,"Wang, Mu-Shun, Chihuang Lin","Idiosyncratic Volatility, Out-of-Sample Predictability, Unscented Kalman Filter, Pricing Bias, Dynamic Factors Volatility","This paper proposes a dynamic factors volatility model and examines its cross-sectional and time-varying impacts on assets prices. The dynamic factors were extracted by using both the unscented Kalman filtering method and the GARCH model. We then investigated the relationship between the volatility of the portfolio dynamic factors and the portfolio returns. In contrast to the static model, the dynamic factors incorporate features of Fama and French 5-factor models, which capture the characteristics of market portfolio, size, value effect, operating profitability, and investment patterns in average returns. We provide evidence that the ex post and lagged ex post factors can improve cross-sectional explanatory power and can increase the predictability of portfolio returns both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our analyses demonstrate that the size and book-to-market sorted portfolios earn a significant positive variance risk premium. However, the dynamic factors predicted by market value have significant negative effects on portfolio returns. We also perform the one-prior-period out-of-sample Diebold-Mariano test of forecasting accuracy paired with other models and find that the dynamic factors have significant effects on the risk premia of both operating profitability and investment policies. This finding supports the theoretical prediction of Bali and Cakici (2008).

We find that a higher consumption tax always reduces the household's welfare if we only investigate the steady state. If the government implements the policy without declaring it in advance, then a higher consumption tax also has a welfare cost. In addition, if we consider an announcement effect for a change in the consumption tax, then the welfare cost drops when the intertemporal elasticity of substitution for consumption is lower, but rises under a longer period of time between the policy's announcement and its implementation.

Therefore, such taxation results in lower savings and investments, and hence slower growth. To promote growth, Nordic countries have begun to implement the dual tax income system since the early 1990s. The dual income tax system levies a lower flat tax rate on capital income, while it maintains a progressive tax rate on labor income. We employ the difference in differences with matching model to examine if the dual income tax system is more beneficial to economic growth than other tax systems. Using data on 167 countries, the empirical results show that the effect of the dual income tax system on growth is statistically positive.

This study explores the evidence of and the influence factors on the long-run Taiwan/U.S. and Taiwan/Japan PPPs as well as PPPs under different exchange rate regimes. We employ the longest available exchange rate data series of the New Taiwan Dollar, consider two influence factors of the Balassa-Samuelson (BS) effect and structural change, and apply the newly developed Fourier form unit-root and stationarity tests. The empirical results show no evidence of long-run Taiwan/U.S. and Taiwan/Japan PPPs as well as PPPs for different regimes. Infact, the influence factors on Taiwan/U.S. and Taiwan/Japan PPPs are different. For the long-run Taiwan/U.S. PPP and PPPs of different regimes, structural change is the main factor. In contrast, the BS effect is the main factor for the long-run Taiwan/Japan PPP, whereby only under a floating regime can both factors influence the support for PPP. The empirical findings reveal that both structural change and the BS effect should be considered in PPP-related studies.

Implementing adaptation action plans in various sectors is currently one of the top priorities for Taiwan’s governmental policy agenda to fight the negative impacts from climate change. The electricity sector plays a key role for the energy industry's climate adaptation. A risk assessment of the impact from climate change on Taiwan's electricity system identifies that heat wave events from climate warming are the major risks. How to cope with the possible impacts of these extreme events and prepare appropriate adaptation is a necessary and urgent task for a utility company. This study identifies and analyzes the risk from heat wave events and formulates appropriate actions for heat wave risk management adaptation for this sector. We adopt the framework of decision making under risk and uncertainty and carry out a stochastic cost and benefit analysis for heat wave risk management. Current and future impacts of weather and climate change on power sectors are prioritized by a multi-criteria analysis to assess the vulnerability of Taiwan's power system. Appropriate adaptation actions for the electricity sector are presented herein.

Accordingly, the research shapes a low carbon and intelligent grid based power system, with the dynamic adjustment ability to effectively balance electricity supply and demand in response to the mitigation and adaptation to future climate change. Based on this framework, the model is established through further considerations, including underlying state variables such as energy, capacity and ancillary services of the power mix, measurement variables such as the energy index and the sustainable index, performance variables such as a value index with a risk index, and control variables such as policy, institution, market, and management factors. In addition, the model also takes into account the mutual relationship and interactions from the feedback mechanism. Accordingly, a dynamic multi-agent system (MAS) model for several scenarios can be executed for empirical simulations. Under sustainable development, system dynamic simulation results are found for various scenarios: (1) adaptive electricity demand, (2) adaptive self-organized non-linear path dependence for smart grid power resources mix, (3) adaptive reserve capacity for evolutionary power planning & assets management, and (4) adaptive electricity prices.

The OLS and probit results show that microenterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and new customers are forced to pay high leasing rates with low credit lines. New customers must also provide collateral of a high value, resulting in a high collateral ratio. These results are similar to the results in banking, but the collateral ratio for microenterprises or SMEs is not significantly higher due to the industrial behavior in leasing.

To remedy the existing shortcoming, this paper adopts the multiplicatively-complete Hicks-Moorsteen TFP index to investigate the domestic banking productivity change in Taiwan. The property that the product of the H-M productivity index and the terms of trade index equals the profitability index is very helpful for understanding how terms of trade change and affect a firm's production decision. Empirical research shows that from 2005 to 2012, Taiwan's domestic banking terms of trade continued to deteriorate, productivity was more prone to improve, but profitability often showed a decreasing trend, and therefore the change in terms of trade generally was dominating profitability. During the sample period, TFP grew notably. While TFP change in the long term was mainly from technological progress, change in the short term was closely associated with pure technical efficiency, output mix efficiency, and scale efficiency. The 2008 global financial tsunami severely affected the performance of the Taiwanese domestic banks. This paper also finds that financial holding banks outperformed independent banks in both TFP change and technological change.

Long-Run Effects of Inflation Under Calvo Staggered Price Contract,Mau-Ting Lin,"Calvo Model, Long-Run Inflation Target","Under Calvo staggered price contracts, there are two types of production inefficiency associated with long-run inflation. One is the average markup distortion that holds back the final production level from its social optimal level. The other is the price variation distortion due to the price erosion from inflation that inefficiently results in more social resources producing the same level of output. The standard Calvo model shows that inflation monotonically enhances both distortions, and therefore a positive long-run inflation target is not desired. However, when the price adjustment frequency is endogenous, the price adjustment speed increases with inflation. Without increasing much price adjustment frequency, minor inflation can erode vintage markups and pull down the average markup, with the output level pushing closer to the social optimum. This partially corrects the average markup distortion. When the inflation rate is low, this gain can outweigh the loss from price variation distortion. We also find that the more competitiveness there is among producers, the lower the optimal long-run inflation target shall be.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201501-201503090020-201503090020-89-134,51.1,2015,Taipei Economic Inquiry

We then assess the shock response of the second ratio to internationalization through the chain rule and parametric tests across equations.

The empirical results show for Taiwan's IE industry that: (1) the depth and width of internationalization, in particular under the sector's relocation to China, substantially reduce domestic employment; (2) an overstatement of the ratio of locally produced exports to total exports leads to an understatement of the adverse effect of internationalization on domestic employment; (3) among the chosen control variables, the factor price, degree of diversification, debt ratio, sub-industry dummy, and market structure affect domestic employment differently in a significant way.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201501-201503090020-201503090020-135-169,51.1,2015,Taipei Economic Inquiry

"Health Risk Perception, Demand, and Willingness to Pay for Weight Reduction","Tsu-Tan Fu, Yih-Ming Lin","Obesity, Contingent Valuation Method, BMI, Doubled-Bound Dichotomous Choice Model","This study investigates factors that affect sample respondents' demand for weight reduction, incorporating the obesity health risk perception, and further develops a means to estimate their willingness to pay (WTP) for a therapy of obesity prevention using survey data of CVDFACTS. As for the decision to participate in an obesity prevention therapy, we find that gender, age, income and job status, BMI, and family illness history are important and significant determinants for respondents. In addition, the results also present that the concerns on social and martial relations as affected by obesity are important and significant determinants. The doubled-bound dichotomous choice model estimates the respondents' WTP. The model estimates that the average willingness to pay for an obesity prevention therapy, which could reduce weight by 5 kilograms in 3 months, is NT$3,388 for the male and NT$4,689 for the female sample respondents, respectively. Furthermore, this study notes that age, income, the concern that work achievement is affected by obesity, and those who have tried to control their weight are important and significant determinants of the WTP. The results of the profile analysis suggest that obese females with high income, high health risk perception, and who have tried to control their weight are the most likely to be willing to pay the greatest amount for the weight-reduction therapy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201401-201403310029-201403310029-69-99,50.1,2014,Taipei Economic Inquiry

This modeling tests the convergence hypothesis and decomposes productivity change into various elements. We collect data from 74 countries, covering 1980-2000, and find evidence that capital stock and human capital are complements, and that financial development is a substitute for human capital, but a complement for human capital. This study supports the convergence hypothesis through low and middle-income countries, whereby the speed of convergence in low-income countries is faster than in middle-income countries, while this study rejects the hypothesis for high-income countries. We note that the marginal productivity of capital of high-income countries is the highest, and that the marginal productivities of labor and human capital of low-income countries are the highest.

We apply a quantile regression technique to characterize the production processes of the manufacturers under consideration at various quantiles of conditional distribution. We then employ the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to measure the difference in productivity between the two types of firms. Evidence shows that the output elasticity of labor is greater than that of capital and increasing returns to scale prevail, indicating that the sample firms should extend their production scale further to lower their long-run average cost. The elasticities of substitution for large firms exceed those of small-medium firms, implying that it is easier to substitute one input for another in large firms than it would be in small-medium firms.

One main result is that an extension of public abatement expenditure is conducive to economic growth, but it tends to decrease the consumption-physical capital ratio. Second, the relationship between abatement expenditures and the inflation rate is ambiguous, and most importantly this result could fit in with the empirical data. We also find that the impact of abatement expenditures on social welfare is doubtful, depending on two forces.

The main purposes of this study are to explore what factors can better explain the time-series and cross-sectional stock returns in Taiwan and to propose some possible reasons for the inconsistent findings in prior studies. Our empirical evidence indicates that the factors that explain time-series or cross-sectional stock returns will change when firm's characteristics used to build portfolios, the number of portfolios used in grouping stocks, or sample selection rules are different. Therefore, in order to avoid biases in making empirical conclusions, a robustness check is indispensable for any asset pricing study in Taiwan. The evidence herein shows that the Nelson four-factor model is more powerful in explaining the time-series stock returns.

Inspired by the output oriented model of Orea (2002), this paper applies the quadratic identity (Diewert, 1976) to derive an input orientated generalized Malmquist productivity index to measure and analyze the economic drivers of productivity change. The empirical findings are as follows. First, for the whole sample firms, on average, the managerial efficiency score is 0.8931 per quarter. Second, there are 3 favorable operating environmental variables (asset scale, stock price index, and concentration of business lines), and 3 unfavorable environmental variables (number of branch offices, FHC securities subsidiary, and capital adequacy). Third, the performance of TFP is significantly and positively related to macroeconomic growth. Within the sample periods, on average, the TFP drops by 0.16% each quarter. The sources of TFP change are the deterioration in technical efficiency (-0.98%), the improvements in scale efficiency (0.35%), and technical change (0.47%). If we exclude the financial crisis year of 2008, then TFP improves.

Given that student tuition differentials exist between universities, this paper explores how student enrollment numbers and graduation standards can be employed to maximize a university's overall performance. We further explore the impact of lowering student tuitions' differential upon this overall performance. We find regardless of the degree offered that a university stresses research first, and those universities with higher tuition fees have established higher graduation standards. Fixed governmental subsidies do not impact the establishment of university graduation standards or recruitment figures, nor determine the intellectual endowment of the students. Second, when government subsidies are equivalent between two universities, then among the universities that stress research it is those schools which charge a lower tuition that tend to have superior overall performance. However, when schools do not stress research, then the schools charging higher tuition tend to have a superior overall performance. Lastly, this paper demonstrates that reducing the tuition differential between universities also cuts the overall performance differential of these universities. Nevertheless the tendency remains that schools which formerly enjoyed good overall performance tend to perform more poorly as time progresses.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201207-201208300001-201208300001-191-224,48.2,2012,Taipei Economic Inquiry

What is the optimal tax structure of the commodity for the different forms of transaction? To our knowledge, taxing different forms of transaction has not yet been theoretically investigated in the literature. The paper establish differences in the purchasing behavior of customers between on-line and in-store transactions based on Becker’s concept of time allocation. With various time costs, the consumer will choose a marketing channel to maximize her utility. In the model, the consumers with the higher wages are likely to purchase the commodity on line. Therefore, the time cost serves as a screening device to reveal the information about their income and provides valuable reference for government policy on income redistribution.

For the reasons given above, this study aims to examine the impact that the disclosure level of the annual report has on the degree of information asymmetry. The empirical results show that the disclosure level of the annual report is negatively associated with the degree of information asymmetry. If we further consider the nature of the disclosure, the evidence shows that the degree of information asymmetry will become lower as the level of voluntary disclosure becomes higher. However, this finding is not applicable to firms under family control or firms with a larger wedge between voting and cash flow rights. As for mandatory disclosure, its effect is not significant in reducing information asymmetry. The implication for policy is that the benefits from promoting voluntary disclosure are better than those from complying with mandatory disclosure regulations in terms of mitigating the degree of information asymmetry.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201101-201103110014-201103110014-45-96,47.1,2011,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Development Zones in China: Are STIPs a Substitute for or a Complement to ETDZs?,"Bih-Jane Liu, Yu-Yin Wu","FDI, Economic Zones, Regional Development, China","This paper examines the relationships between two types of development zones in China, namely, the Economic Technological Development Zones (ETDZs) and Science and Technology Industrial Parks (STIPs), during the period 2001 to 2005. After controlling for regional characteristics, the results show that an ETDZ with a STIP located in the same region (city) attracts significantly more foreign direct investment (FDI), an indication of a complementary relationship between ETDZs and STIPs. This complementary relationship is reinforced by the fact that more exports, sales, or employment on the part of STIPs induces greater FDI to the ETDZs within the same region. However, the spillovers fall unevenly across regions. The ETDZs in the coastal regions benefit more from the presence of STIPs than those in the inland regions, which may lead to greater regional development disparities in China.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201101-201103110014-201103110014-97-145,47.1,2011,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Measuring Cost Efficiencies in Domestic Banks: Application of the Metafrontier Approach,"Huang-Ping Yen, Jing-Wen Chang","Financial Holding Company, Metafrontier, Technology Gap Ratio","The cost efficiencies of domestic banks operating under a given technology, assumed to be defined by a stochastic frontier model, are not comparable efficiencies for banks operating under different technologies. Therefore, this study uses the concept of a metafrontier to compare the efficiencies of banks that may be classified into different groups. Panel data for 4 groups covering the 1991-2008 period are employed to illustrate this model. The empirical results show that the banks joining the financial holding companies in the later years are more efficient and enjoy greater cost savings than any other group of domestic banks during the period 1991-2000. By contrast, the banks not joining the financial holding companies are better than all the others during the period 2001-2008. Moreover, all of the domestic banks exhibit economies of scale and scope over the period, implying that the banks joining the financial holding companies should focus on product diversification so as to take advantage of cost savings.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-201101-201103110014-201103110014-147-181,47.1,2011,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Marriage Premium of Male Worker in Taiwan: Evidence from Endogenous Selection Model,"Chien-Liang Chen, Yu-Jhang Chen","Wage Equation, Marriage Premium, Gender Division, Selectivity","This study estimates the patterns of marriage premium of male wage in Taiwan over the 90's, focusing on the selectivity of marriage and the endogeneity of wife's labor force participation. The empirical results show that marriage status is evidently selected in male's wage equation. Positive marriage premium existing in male wage over the late 90's is significantly associated with wife's labor supply. Wife's joining labor market brings about favorable effects on husband's wage due to the complementarity of the couple's labor market human capital. Gender division in domestic services is not prevalent in Taiwan, thus wife's working hour does not cause significant unfavorable effects on husband's wage.

Is the Advantage of Nominal Income Targeting Valid in the New Keynesian Forward-Looking Model? a Target Zone Perspective under the Interest Rate Rule,Chung-Rou Fang,"New Keynesian Forward-Looking Model, Nominal Income Targeting, Target Zone Policy, Stochastic Processes","Based on a New Keynesian forward-looking model embodying both future output and inflation expectations, this paper develops a graphical exposition to explain stabilizing performance of targeting nominal income relative to targeting interest rate from the viewpoint of target zones. Contrast to the outcomes of Bean (1983) and West (1986), with different shocks but stabilization through the non-conventional interest rate rule, we find that the elasticity of aggregate demand to real money balances is not the key factor in targeting nominal income. In addition, we discover that previous wisdom regarding the advantage of targeting nominal income stems from focusing on the level of nominal income. If the target zone of nominal income is considered, output expectations would generate a conflict effect to the realization of the nominal income band.

Therefore, the fitness and prediction ability of the models would be affected. In this paper, the reject inference technology is considered in the financial distress prediction as building the modified Heckman two-stage sample selection model. Using the modified model and Taiwan's listed companies as examples, we could find that the application and the default stages are highly correlated in distress prediction.

Our hypothesis is thus that the bank development is a blessing to economic growth at the low bank development regime but a curse at the high bank development regime. To examine this ”blessing-in-low-regime” and ”curse-in-high-regim” hypothesis, we develop a dynamic panel threshold model (DPTM) to test this hypothesis.

This policy change has made great impacts on futures pricing in the Taiwanese futures market, such as frequently appearance of negative bases. If futures traders do not detect the trend of the Taiwanese dividend-payout policy and view the appearance of negative bases as arbitrage opportunities, they will suffer from loses. Therefore, an accurate estimation of dividend payouts for the TSE (Taiwan Stock Exchange) index is very important. Regretfully, none of past literature provides an accurate estimation of dividend payouts for the TSE index. Even literature on the pricing of Taiwanese stock index futures only provides rough and inaccurate estimates.

The Behavior of the Interest Rate for Credit Cards in Taiwan's Banks,Yong-Chin Liu,"Switch Cost, Business Intensity, Information Asymmetry, Adverse Selection, Panel Data, 2SLS","This paper aims to test whether the pricing of credit-card interest rates depends on banks' capital costs, information asymmetry, adverse selection as well as credit-card switch costs, operating size, business intensity, and credit risks. Employing regression analysis with panel data on monthly frequency, this study examines the interest rate behavior of credit cards in Taiwan's banks and the relationship between interest rate behavior and nonperforming loans for credit cards. The findings are that credit-card operating size, credit risks and bank's costs of capital have not affects on credit-card interest rate behaviors, indicating the pricing of credit card rates is unreasonable; there is a negative relation between credit-card rates and business intensity; decreasing in interest rates for a bank and difference in interest rates across banks do not cause adverse selections.

A Study of Cost and Strategy of CO2 Abatement for Taiwan: The Implications of Participation in IET and Intensity Target,"Tsung-Chen Lee, Chiung-Yao Tseng, Chien-Ming Lee","CO2 Abatement, Abatement Cost, Abatement Strategy, International Emission Trading, Abatement Target","The goal of this paper is to explore the cost and strategy of GHG abatement for Taiwan. Based on the conclusion of the total quantity control target drawn from the 1998 national energy conference and the carbon intensity target proposed by the Bush Administration, nine scenarios are simulated to examine the implications of participation in international emission trading and the carbon intensity target on Taiwan's macro-economy, average compliance cost, energy structure, and carbon intensity. The insights which emerge from this paper are summarized as follows: (1) Under the scenarios of domestic abatement in Taiwan, the GDP loss and the average compliance cost of the total quantity control target are higher than those of carbon intensity target; (2) With the participation in international emission trading, the GDP loss and the average compliance cost of the total quantity control target are, on the contrary, lower than those of carbon intensity target. In particular, the involvement of the non Annex-I countries adds to the potential for lower cost abatement, reflecting the cost effectiveness of global cooperation; (3) No matter what kinds of targets are adopted in Taiwan, GHG abatement leads to an improvement in carbon intensity, average emission factor, and energy efficiency; (4) The cost of abating GHG crucially hinges on the abatement targets. The simulation results of this paper suggest that the Taiwanese government should strive for the opportunity of international cooperation of GHG abatement. Owing to its ambiguous political status, the government might try to make it through the channel of World Trade Organization. In the circumstances of failing to do so, on the other hand, the government could set the target of an improvement in carbon intensity, and collaborates with the ones possessing the same point of view so as to form the mainstream of the global economy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200507-41-2-155-189-a,41.2,2005,Taipei Economic Inquiry

Imperfect Competition and Common Resource Exploitation: An Analysis of Renewable Resource Management with Non-use Values,Wen-Chun Chang,"common resource exploitation, non-use value, over-exploitation","This article analyzes the importance of non-use values in the management of natural resources under an oligopoly model. By constructing a duopolistic framework, the interaction among the effects of non-use values, market power, and common exploitation is investigated. While the problem of common exploitation often results in over-depletion without cooperation, the effects of non-use values and market power provide economic incentives for exploiters to reduce harvests. In the presence of non-use values, the extent of inefficiency caused by common exploitation in an oligopolistic market can substantially differ from what results from the model of a perfectly competitive market without non-use values. The non-cooperative equilibrium, the cooperated equilibrium, and the socially optimal equilibrium are characterized to examine the inefficiency caused by the problem of common exploitation under an oligopolistic framework with non-use values. It is found that the degree of inefficiency will depend on whether the economic incentives for conserving the resource stemming from non-use values and market power can completely offset the effect of common exploitation. The role of non-use value appears to be important, especially for the case that non-use values influence the results for different levels of competitiveness in the output market of oligopoly.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200501-41-1-1-44-a,41.1,2005,Taipei Economic Inquiry

In addition to the banking development variables, we also consider the stock market variables. We distinguish such two kinds of financial development variables causing the different impact on economic growth of Taiwan. Different from previous studies, we adopt the threshold regression model and dissect the impacts of the developments of banking sector and stock market on economic growth. The empirical evidences explore that the financial development variables exist exogeneity. Taking the ratio of stock market trading as the threshold variable, we also find the threshold effect exists in the banking, stock market development and the economic growth. Thus, the financial development could promote economic growth only in the condition of lower level of financial development. But in the higher development state, the relation between the financial development and economic growth would fade away. Aside from this, we find that developed banking sector can significantly promote the economic growth when the stock market is in a lower developed state; however the relationship disappears when the stock market is highly developed.

The Study on Economic Effects Brought by Open Market of Liquefied Petroleum Gas,Chuen-Fa Chuang,"Successive monopoly, double marginalization, vertical integration","Based on this study, the two waves of market liberalization in the liquefied petroleum gas industry resulted in the following three effects: Ⅰ. The first wave of market liberalization upgraded the market's competitiveness. As predicted by the successive monopoly model of industrial economics, market liberalization has the following effects: drop in trading prices and hike in trading volume. Empirical data has also verified this trend.
Ⅱ. The second wave of market liberalization broke China Petroleum Company's monopoly supplier-ship in the liquefied petroleum gas market. Increase in the number of suppliers immediately created further effects to the competitions in the liquefied petroleum gas market.
Ⅲ. The effect of the first market liberalization to the distributor market reached only to the dimension of trading prices between the distributors and tanking factories; no effects has been reflected on the consumer prices. The second market liberalization, on the other hand, brought increases in the number of suppliers and the effects were reflected on the drop in the end consumer prices. The above results show that if the government's open market policies reach only to the distributor market, the effects probably can only reach the stage of profit sharing between the upstream and downstream ends in the product distribution chain. It has no actual effects on the benefits of consumers. Contrarily, if a market is opened in an overall scale, the positive effects will reach the consumer end and the goal of open market policies will be actually achieved.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200501-41-1-75-103-a,41.1,2005,Taipei Economic Inquiry

The Empirical Study of Strategic Alliances of High-Technology Industry – An Application to Biotechnology Industry,"Koy-In Chang, Yung-Hsiang Ying","Biotechnology, high Technology, Strategic Alliance","In response to the rapidly changing environment and technology around the world and the more competitive market situation, many firms form strategic alliances possibly due to their incomplete ability or limited resources. By allying with others, firms may share costs and risks, and may lower competitiveness within the industry. This tactic is more observed in to higher-tech industries. Much existing literature has discussed the causes, pros, and cons of alliances, but few have theoretically or empirically proven them. This paper takes one rising high-tech industry--biotechnology--as an example and tries to empirically test the reasons behind strategic alliances and analyzes what kind of firms are likely to form them. Theoretical assumptions are first made and followed by empirical analyses. The sample includes both Taiwan and US biotech firms. Firms from different countries are analyzed separately and then results from each country are compared and contrasted. The results from the US firms are in general consistent with the theoretical predictions: strategic alliances are more likely to happen in small, research oriented firms; research type alliances are more likely to occur in none-publicly traded firms; and, the intense use of alliances decreases as the ages of the firms increase.

The typical two-stage DEA method in the current literature computes non-parametric efficiency scores at the first stage. At the second stage, censored Tobit regressions are used to identify external factors that are thought to influence the estimated efficiency sores. Methodologically, it is inconsistent to use a non-parametric estimation at the first stage, while switching to a parametric method in the later stage for further discussions. Furthermore, it is well known that censored Tobit regression results are biased and inconsistent if the parametric assumptions are problematic. In this study, we suggest the symmetrically-trimmed least squares (STLS; Powell, 1986) and censored least absolute deviation (CLAD; Powell, 1984) for the second stage discussion, and compare their results with those of the censored Tobit regressions.
The first stage estimation results suggest that technical inefficiency is pervasive among local hospitals. Moreover, public local hospitals performed worse than their private counterparts. The second stage analysis suggests ownership, size, average stay, and bed flows are the factors that influence efficiency. Finally, the estimation results of the semiparametric STLS and CLAD are more stable than those of the censored Tobit regressions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200401-40-1-61-95-a,40.1,2004,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Welfare Analysis of the Bundling Marketing Strategy in a Stackelberg Duopoly,"Chun-Hsiung Liao, Hsin-Yih Hsu","Hotelling Demand, Bundling Marketing Strategy, Stackelberg Price Competition, Social Welfare","This paper studies on a leader-follower duopoly in which each firm produces two perfectly complementary products. They choose one of the following three marketing stragegies: pure component pricing, pure bundling pricing and mixed bundling pricing; and then compete in a Stackelberg fashion. The results show that even though mixed bundling pricing provides more flexible choices to consumers, it triggers a more aggressive competition between firms. Hence, in the equilibrium both firms select less competitive pure component pricing. If consumer welfare deserves a bigger weight in the measurement of social welfare, the equilibrium strategy induces the lowest level of social welfare. Otherwise, it brings the highest of social welfare.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200401-40-1-97-129-a,40.1,2004,Taipei Economic Inquiry
The Growth Consequences of Environmental Pollution with Elastic Labor Supply,"Jhy-Hwa Chen, Wen-Tzong Hsiao, Jhy-Yuan Shieh","announcement effects, endogenous growth, elastic labor supply, pollution, public abatement","Using an AK technology endogenous growth model with endogenous leisure-labor choice and inevitable by-product pollution damage generation, this paper tends to examine the relationship between environmental policy, environmental factor and economic growth. Working on such a framework, it is found that an increase in public abatement expenditure, in production technology, in environment consciousness and in the private capital elasticity of pollution damage incremental will stimulate steady-state economic growth rate. But a rise in leisure consciousness and in public abatement elasticity of pollution damage reduction will lower the steady-state economic growth rate.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200307-39-2-147-172-a,39.2,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Analyzing the Potential Gains from Bank Mergers in Taiwan,"Yung-Chi Chen, Tsu-Tan Fu","bank merger, cost savings, thick frontier, Taiwanese Bank","In recent years, a growing number of banks in Taiwan have considered using the mean of bank merger to obtain potential cost savings and scale or scope economies. This paper adopts the concept of thick frontier and cost function approach to simulate the potential cost savings from mergers of 47 Taiwanese domestic banks. We have also further decomposed such merger gains into gains from scale and scope economies and gains from x-efficiency improvement. The empirical results have shown that the cost savings from sample bank mergers are substantial for all merger cases. In addition, cost savings from bank mergers between different cost structure banks are found to be much higher than those from bank mergers between the same cost structure banks. The impact of adopting better production technology could result in an over 30% of cost savings from bank mergers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200307-39-2-173-196-a,39.2,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Determinants of National Health Care Expenditure: A Time Series and Threshold Model Approach,"Shih-Neng Chen, Ya-Ling Chiou","health expenditure, time series, unit root test, co-integration test, threshold model","This paper uses national health expenditure data in Taiwan from 1954 to 1999 to construct time series and threshold models and to explore the determinants of the growth of health expenditure. Results indicate that, per capita GDP, the ratio of insured, doctors and beds per capita, and unemployment rate, are all key factors affecting the growth of health expenditure. We also uses per capita GDP, the ratio of insured, doctors and beds per capita, and unemployment rate to be the threshold variables, respectively, to test the structure changes of the health expenditure. Results reveal that per capita GDP is the most important factor determining health expenditures, but the existence of medical insurance may mitigate this effect. Finally, the growth of unemployment rate increases medical care expenditure.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200307-39-2-197-240-a,39.2,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Assumptions in Economics,Richard C. Lin,"F-twist, assumptions, F-twist, knowledge, justification, the Gettier problem","This paper explores the realisticness of assumptions. The existing literature has concluded that the assumptions of negligibility, applicability, and joint negligibility need to be realistic. From the perspective of establishing an individual theory, however, does the above conclusion remain valid? Are there other assumptions that need to be realistic? These are valuable issues. Our research results indicate that the conventional wisdom remains effective, but the core assumption of atomistic individuals (events) utilized by mainstream economists needs to be relaxed in order to improve the truth condition, and the justification condition as well, of a theory (knowledge). In addition, while using data collected from the open system (i.e. the world of nature that contains no hypothesis and constraint) to test conclusions derived from a closed system (i.e. a man-made world that includes hypotheses and constraints), mainstream economists need to be aware of the Gettier problem during their justification. Under this consideration, be as realistic as possible is the best strategy for setting up assumptions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200307-39-2-241-272-a,39.2,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Does an Exogenous or an Endogenous Growth Model Fare Better? Evidence from the GDP growth rates of 24 OECD countries,Hsiu-Yun Lee,"exogenous growth, endogenous growth, transitional dynamics","This paper evaluates typical exogenous and endogenous growth models in light of their transitional dynamics implications. Rather than selecting a very special stochastic process of technology shock so as to match a specific output process, we assume only a simple AR transitory shock in both growth models. After deriving the growth rate of output under the two models, this paper tests the cross-equation restrictions for 24 OECD countries' output growth rates. We find all but one of the growth series pass the endogenous growth hypothesis. However, even with the transitional dynamics implications in both models, in 75% of the OECD countries the output dynamics are observationally equivalent between the endogenous and the exogenous growth models.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200301-39-1-1-25-a,39.1,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
The Economic Instruments for Climate Change: A Survey,Kwo-Dong Wey,"climate change, carbon tax, emission trading, joint implementation, clean development mechanism","The issues of CO2 emission and climate change have become the most important problems in the world. There are two kinds, price control and quantity control, of economic instruments for the reduction of CO2 emission. The policy of price control is imposing the carbon tax. And the policies of quantity control include emission trading, joint implementation, and clean development mechanism that were proposed in 1997 Kyoto Protocol. This study will interpret these four different policies in terms of theoretical backgrounds, operation rules, benefits and costs, and their relationships.
However, there is no theoretical model and no empirical model in the study. And this study only deals with the literature reviews.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200301-39-1-27-69-a,39.1,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
Road Investment and Congestion Tolling with Information Provision,Jyh-Fa Tsai,"road capacity, road investment, congestion tolling, information","This paper intends to analyze the integrated effects of three instruments (congestion tolling, information provision, and investment on road capacity) on improving the efficiency of road usage. The information provision effect is dealt with by comparing perfect and imperfect information cases. The road network includes one-link cases and two-link cases. Various regimes are modeled to maximize welfare at first and comparative-static analysis is then used to analyze the impact of the changes in the parameters. The result shows that the role of road investment is active. When the demand increases, the road investment will increase and therefore the optimal toll may not increase too much compared to the road congestion pricing literature without road investment such as Verhoef et al. (1996).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200301-39-1-71-102-a,39.1,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
The Optimization of a Centralized Sequential Investment Problem under the Linear Effect on Regional Characteristics,"Cheng-Chang Chang, Kun-Tsung Kuo","Centralized sequential investment strategy, Path effectiveness, Sequential effectiveness, Regional characteristics, Memoriless property","This research is conducted under the basic conditions of global economic downturn and adopts the centralized sequential investment strategy as the appropriate strategic choice for international market advancement mode. Accordingly, the optimization model of a centralized sequential investment problem (CSIP) for transnational investment is then developed by using the mathematical programming, in order to obtain the sequential investment path to fulfill the desired robustly operation capacity on international market within the shortest time period. In addition, this research introduces the concepts of path effectiveness and sequential effectiveness. Also, the regional characteristics are regarded as major factor that affects the timing of reaching predetermined operation rewards in an investment region. We further assume regional characteristics have the completely memoriless property and linear effect. Based on such limitations, the CSIP's structural properties are demonstrated and the solving formulation is then developed by using 0-1 integer programming. Finally, in order to emphasize the CSIP's feasibility and application value, the discussions referring to the model's meanings as well as the meanings of ”the linear effect on regional characteristics” in the real world are also proposed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10181245-200301-39-1-103-131-a,39.1,2003,Taipei Economic Inquiry
