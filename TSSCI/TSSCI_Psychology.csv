The Influence Experience of Family Strengths on Adolescent’s Career Purpose Development,"Yu-Chen Wang, Chia-Hui Lin, Yi-Hsin Liu, Tzu-Jung Chang","career-oriented purpose, family strengths, grounded analysis, parent-child","Career-oriented purpose (Damon, 2008) is an inner, firm intention toward one’s future career, which brings pleasure, satisfaction, and meaningfulness to individuals. The exploration of career-oriented purpose specifically focuses on adolescents or young students without any work experience, probing into their plans and ideas for their future careers and their reflections after their attempt to act. The benefits that career-oriented purpose brings to adolescents not only deeply influences these adolescents’ careers but also their personal self-identity and lives. The development of career-orientation purpose is greatly under the influence of one’s cultural background and experience of growth, yet only a small number of studies explore the family context within which the career-oriented purpose development in adolescents is influenced. The current study was based on family strengths, exploring the family strengths factors that influence the career-oriented purpose in adolescents and understanding the influences on the career-oriented purpose development. Overall, the purpose of this study was to explore parents’ and their children’s family strengths experience, which facilitate the development and the influence process of careeroriented purpose development in adolescents. The research questions addressed in the current study are as follow:(1)What are the facilitating factors and family strengths with which the awareness of parents facilitates the development of their adolescent children’s career-oriented purpose?(2)What are the family strengths with which the awareness of adolescent facilitates their career-oriented purpose development?(3)What are the influential experiences of family strengths in the career-oriented purpose development?(4)What are the family strengths that facilitate the career-oriented purpose in children?The participants (N = 30) were 15 students along with one of their parents. The student participants were 6 boys and 9 girls between 14 and 23 years old (M = 17.87, SD = 2.95). Four of them were junior high school students, four were senior high students, 6 were college students and 1 was a graduate school student. The parent participants were 11 mothers and 4 fathers between 39 and 59 years old (M = 47.93, SD = 5.46). We conducted one-to-one individual interviews with the participants based on a semi-structured interview prototype and the collected data were analyzed with qualitative grounded theory. The parent interview questions are divided into four concepts: (1) The concept related to careers–the influence that the parents give to or the action that they take for their children, addressing questions like “what do you do to assist your children in exploring their interests?” (2) The concept related to family strengths or memorable moments that the parents bring to their children, addressing questions like “what are the things that you like most about your family?” and “how do these things influence your children’s ambition development.” (3) The concept related to conflicts and challenges, addressing questions like “when confronting conflicts or disagreement with your children when you have different opinions toward their career choices, what have you been doing to cope with these conflicts?” (4) The concept related to adjustment and reflections, addressing questions like “what do you realize or learn most after you have experience of dealing with your children’s parental education?”The children interview questions are divided into four concepts: (1) The concept related to family-related aspects that influence their ambitions, addressing questions like “what roles do your families play during the development of your ambition?” (2) The concept related to family strengths or memorable moments related to their family, addressing questions like “what are the things that you like your family most?” and “do these things have influence on your career ambition?” (3) The concept related to conflicts and challenges, addressing questions like “what do you and your parents do to cope with the pressure related to your career choice?” (4) The concept related to overall influence and feedback, addressing questions like “what do your family bring to you on the path to achieve your ambition?” and “what impressed you the most and what did you learn from this experience?”After we explained and clarified the relevant information to the participants via invitation letters, the participants signed the consent letters and joined the research study. The current study provided complete training to the interviewers, conducted pilot study, and fully explained interview procedures to the school guidance and counseling office, which served as a gatekeeper to protect the rights and welfare of the participants. We also gave a gift around NTD200 to each participant as a token of appreciation for their participation.The current study is based on credibility, transferability, reliability, and verifiability (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) as the indicators to verify the reliability of the study. For study reliability, the interviewers in the current study wrote counseling notes after every interview. Besides, we conducted study analysis with research analysts to triangulate research findings.Family strengths in the perspectives of parents consists of career aspects and general aspects. Career aspects show that the elements of family strengths are derived from career aspects, including valuing and encouraging children’s efforts, providing resources and participating, openness and independence, career support and affirmation, flexible and adjustable parenting attitude towards different personalities and needs, and being a role model for children. General aspects in family strengths indicate general, comprehensive, and complete strengths in life. These general aspects are not prone to career aspects but include an expectation to convey an idea and company and a close connection to one another. Family strengths in the perspectives of children are respectively induced into career and general aspects based on analysis results of the study. Career aspects refer to the strengths that are prone to career strengths, including the guidance on and encouragement to career exploration, learning from their parents who are their role models, financial and informational support, being liberal and supportive, and a flexible and adjustable way of parenting. General aspects are related to the family strengths in life and other fields, including receiving expectation and building life value, caring, trust and close, intimate interaction.Facilitating factors of family strengths experience from parents include the ability to reflect and get feedback and learning from parental roles, valuing family beliefs and commitment, past career experience, work resources and influential experiences, religious beliefs, and strengths obtained from other resource. The influences of family strengths experience on children’s career development include enlightenment ambition exploring, career concern and thoughts initiating, career information obtaining and career direction confirming, career direction establishing and action strengthening, career calling value setting, multiadaptability developing, and career confidence and motivation gaining.After the results were induced, the career-oriented purpose developed is beneficial to family strengths experience, and its significance and meaningfulness further formed a dynamic family strengths system. Family strengths share some aspects between parents and children, and the constructed dynamic family strengths system influences career-oriented purpose in children as well as reinforces parenting experience in return. The cycle of this dynamic system continuously progresses as children grow with time.Based on the results, the study established an impact process model of a family strengths to facilitate career-oriented purpose development. We also make some suggestion for practitioners: (1) Parents play key roles in promoting family strengths for adolescents. Counseling practitioners are suggested to assist parents by empowering them in developing more facilitating factors of family strengths developed in the current study. For example, counseling practitioners may guide parents to reflect and learn parenting roles as well as examine past experience of growth and value passed on in the family to increase awareness of related strengths. In this way, parents may understand more internal and external resources, with which children may utilize to face challenges. (2) Family educationist may advocate the importance of parenting relationship and family time, encouraging to cultivate more family strengths. (3) Career practitioners may put emphasis on the importance of parents’ involvement and participation in their children’s career exploration. Career practitioners are suggested to lead investigations into family strengths for adolescents to reinforce their action and sense of hope. Family value and value that are passed on are subtle but significant family strengths. Parents and children can work together to explore, realize, and exert the influence of family strengths. Future studies may include other contexts involved with career-oriented strengths. They may also develop a family strengths scale for adolescents to further explore the correlations among important career-related variables of family strengths, career-oriented purpose, and career adaptabilities and the correlations among variables of family strengths, personal strengths, and careeroriented purpose.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2952,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Study on the Effect of Integrating Hope Theory into the Teaching of Group Counseling Courses,"Lih-Horng Hsieh, Pei-Shan Tsai","hope theory, group counseling, group leadership, group leader","This education-related study explored the effect of hope theory being integrated into the teaching of group counseling courses on leadership abilities in group counseling and learning motivation for students at the bachelor’s level. The study involved 64 participants who were junior college students from two classes in the Department of Guidance and Counseling at an institution in Taiwan. Three elements of hope theory, namely goals, pathway thinking, and agency thinking, were integrated into the teaching process and the teacher’s instructional attitude, and the content of the group counseling curriculum was structured to impart group leadership skills to students. Furthermore, a curriculum design and arrangements that promote students’ involvement in learning were applied to help them learn effectively. Before and after the students undertook the group counseling course, the Group Counseling Leadership Scale and the Chinese Domain-Specific Life Goal Scale–Academic were utilized as measurement tools to discern the effects of the group counseling course. After course grades were assigned, the students were invited to complete the open questionnaire and participate in focus group interviews. The data from the questionnaire and interview served as the basis for the qualitative analysis in this study.Through phenomenological content analysis, the data were clustered into three themes: the positive effects of the integration of hope theory into teaching strategies on learners, the key elements that impacted learners’ sense of hope in academic learning, and the benefits of hope theory being integrated into the group counseling curriculum for effective learning of group leadership. In the first theme, the positive effects of the integration of hope theory into teaching strategies on learners were grouped into two subthemes. The first subtheme was regarding the teaching strategy that involved providing clear learning goals in assignments such as group planning and presentations. This can encourage learners to adopt various learning strategies, such as reading, researching, consulting senior graders, reviewing prior learning materials, and discussing with peers. To prepare group presentations, the students thus become self-motivated to understand group counseling theories and acquire pre-group preparatory skills in depth. Peer work itself also promoted learners’ active involvement and reciprocal learning in the process. For the second subtheme, in the teaching strategies of the hope theory integrated into the curriculum, especially with weekly hope-theory-based worksheets, learners could set goals, plan their learning, and seek methods to help them implement the learning and achieve their goals. The respondents of the interview and questionnaire stated that both the learning direction and guidance in the weekly worksheet provided reference and learning opportunities on the basis of which learners could set concrete goals. This is especially beneficial for learners who want to learn but have difficulties finding an orientation. However, learners have vacillating evaluation of their goals and confidence to achieve them. A few learners may value the implementation of practical actions and the simultaneous output of the results. They then engage in a certain degree of self-judgement by, for example, being judgmental for not working sufficiently hard in their evaluation, which may influence their agency thinking. Overall, the respondents stated that they were guided to establish effective learning habits and that they would like to continue those habits.In the second theme, the learners’ sense of hope in academic learning was influenced by various personal factors such as personal goals, past learning experience, and habits. Notably, both the teaching strategies and instructional attitudes of the teacher with hope theory integrated into the curriculum had positive influences on learning experience, learning motivation, and confidence in learning. The data in the second theme were grouped into two subthemes. In the first subtheme, under the studentcentered teaching principle, the teacher constantly seeks methods to motivate and encourage students to learn effectively. For example, the introduction of vacillating to hope theory and the weekly hope-theory-based worksheet was arranged to guide and encourage learners to apply concepts of hope theory in their learning throughout the course. The respondents shared positive feedback on having confidence in learning especially after actually accomplishing their goals. The second subtheme entailed the instructor giving positive and constructive feedback to the students. The respondents stated that the teacher recognized and highlighted the learners’ strengths; they further strengthened the learners’ theoretical foundation and its application through nonjudgmental feedback about learners’ presentations. The instructor’s constructive feedback inspired positive feelings and experience among the learners, who were more willing to accept feedback provided in a positive spirit. As such, the instructor could motivate students to expand pathway thinking and enhance their agency thinking.The third theme concerned the benefits of hope theory being integrated into the group counseling curriculum for effective learning in group leadership. To integrate the hope theory into the curriculum, the teacher created the content for group counseling on the basis of the group leadership capabilities that the learners should possess, including psychological and behavioral characteristics of group leaders, professional ethical behaviors of group counseling, pre-group preparatory skills for group conduct, and leadership skills. The responses from the learners indicated that a well-planned curriculum requires substantial effort by the learners. The teacher also requires considerable learning input from students. However, when learners understand that both the plans and requirements set by the teacher are reasonable, their levels of agency in learning increase and their academic performance also improves. In addition, learners are motivated and encouraged by the teacher’s genuine constructive feedback. The teacher’s diligent attitude and teaching by example and precept evidently play the role of demonstration, thereby piquing the interest of the learners and motivating them to learn. The statistical results indicated that after the hope theory was integrated into the group counseling curriculum, the overall group leadership abilities improved, especially in terms of the psychological and behavioral characteristics of group leaders, theoretical foundation, pre-group preparatory skills, leadership skills in group process, and professional ethical behaviors of group counseling; among these, the improvement in theoretical foundation was most significant. The average score of hope in academics increased after the courses were completed but was not significantly different from that before the courses. However, higher hope of students was positively correlated with superior leadership in group counseling. The qualitative analysis in this study revealed the meanings, effects, and feasibility of group counseling teaching being integrated with hope theory.The present study on the effect of integrating hope theory into the teaching of group counseling courses suggests that a follow-up curriculum could adopt the method of cooperative learning based on the learning methods of mutual assistance, support, discussion, and motivation among peers to achieve learning goals, thereby enhancing the sense of hope in academic learning, the motivation for active learning, and the effects of learning.Because this study did not involve a control group, the causal relationship between learning effectiveness and the integration of the hope theory into the teaching strategy could not be determined. The results can be used only for reference for the improvement of teaching design and implementation methods. Therefore, future studies should adopt experimental methods or adopt research designs similar to countermeasures to obtain more results on the cause and effect of learning effectiveness.Given the possible delay effect of the research on the sense of hope, future studies can increase the number of questions in the tracking questionnaire to explore whether learning is more effectively internalized after a period of digestion after the course, which may thereby increase the hope score.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2953,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Resilience Among Students of Elementary School With and Without Learning Disabilities: Person-and VariableFocused Approaches,Wan-Feng Chang,"mental health, risk factor, protective factor, resilience, learning disabilities","Students with learning disabilities (LD) have difficulty with their basic learning abilities, such as listening, speaking, reading, writing, and calculating, because of problems in their neuropsychological functions. LD also has negative effects on an individual’s learning process and social emotions. The self-efficacy and motivation of students with LD are lower than those of students without LD. Studies have reported that students with LD have poor mental health. The presence of an LD is a risk factor for mental health concerns, and the identification of mental health risks and protective factors for individuals with LD is necessary to design effective intervention models. Most previous relevant studies have recruited students without LD, and only a few have recruited those with LD.A few studies have employed multiple methods that combine person-focused strategies with variable-focused strategies because they offer complementary methodological strengths. Person-focused models can be used to identify resilient people and understand how resilience develops by comparing the resilient with those who are not, namely those who are not faring well in adverse situations and have not experienced any threats to their development. A variable-focused approach focuses on the relationship between the indices of stress or adversity and the influencing factors of resilience and psychosocial functions. In summary, person-focused methods recognize the functions of a person as a living system, whereas variable-focused methods can be used to delve deeper into specific processes. The present study attempted to use these two approaches to attain a more comprehensive understanding of resilience among students with LD. In previous studies, students with LD were not considered the reference group; thus, we lack evidence on whether the resilience of students with LD differs from that of students with LD. Finally, this study explored the resilience mechanism of students with LD and can be used as a reference to determine how to provide support and assistance to students with poor mental health.The study group of this research was composed of students with and without LD who were in grades 3 to 5 at elementary schools in Kaohsiung City. They were selected during the second semester of 2017 using the stratified purposeful sampling method. With parents’ permission, 802 students participated in this study, including 275 third graders, 269 fourth graders, and 258 fifth graders from 13 elementary schools. A total of 375 students had LD, including 113 third graders, 132 fourth graders, and 129 fifth graders from the resource classes in 55 elementary schools. Given the reading ability of students with LD, reducing the length of the questionnaire was necessary so that they could complete the survey. The study instruments included protective factors, mental health questionnaires, and academic achievement tests. The questionnaire on protective factors and mental health included five internal protective factors (i.e., physical self-concept, emotional self-concept, mathematics self-concept, Chinese self-concept, and self-efficacy) and three external protective factors (i.e., teacher support, peer support, and parental support), as well as mental health. The items in the questionnaire were scored from 4 (strongly agree) to 1 (strongly disagree), with higher scores indicating greater levels of performance. The academic achievement test included their achievements in Chinese and mathematics. These two instruments have demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity. For the person-focused approach, students with LD were classified into four groups through cluster analysis on the basis of the indices of both their mental health and academic achievement. A two-step method was applied to cluster the students. The protective factors in the different clusters of students with LD were compared. Furthermore, this study compared the protective factors in different clusters to determine whether there were significant differences between students with and without LD. For the variable-focused approach, the direct and the indirect modes were used to examine which protective factors could be used to predict the mental health of students with and without LD. A path analysis was used to test the direct and indirect model between the protective factors and mental health. In the direct model, the researcher assumes that each protective factor is positively correlated with mental health whereas the risk factors (mathematics and Chinese achievement) are negatively correlated. The indirect model was used to examine the hypothesis that self-efficacy acts as a mediator in the relationship of social support and self-concept with mental health. The main hypothesis of the variable-focused approach was tested using an application for structural equation modeling and by employing AMOS 22.Through the person-focused approach, the results obtained for the variables for students without LD were significantly higher than those for students with LD. In particular, the differences in their mental health and self-efficacy were large effect size, whereas the differences in their Chinese and mathematics achievements were more significant. After grouping the students through cluster analysis, four subgroups of students with LD were formed based on the following indicators: those high on mental health and high on academic achievement (positively adjusted, 29.26%); those high on mental health and low on academic achievement (resilient, 32.67%); those low on mental health and high on academic achievement (maladaptive, 10.80%); and those low on mental health and low on academic achievement (vulnerable, 27.27%). Students without LD were also divided into the same four groups (positively adjusted, 30.88%; resilient, 29.33%; maladaptive, 10.80%; and vulnerable, 11.24%). Regardless of whether the students had LD or not, no significant differences were observed in any protective factors for the two groups of students who were resilient and positively adjusted; however, a significant difference in academic achievement was observed. Between the two subgroups with similar low academic achievements, no significant differences in protective factors were noted. The present study discovered that students with LD and resilience had poor academic achievement but good mental health and the protective factors played a key role; among the two subgroups of students with LD with similar academic achievements, the protective factors for those at high risk were also higher.The academic achievement of the subgroup of resilient students with LD was poor, but the students exhibited better psychological adaptation than those who were maladaptive, mainly because of the protective factors. Among the two subgroups of students with LD who had similar academic achievements, the protective factors of the highly vulnerable students were lower than those of the competent students. In this study, the proportion of resilient and competent students with LD was approximately 50%. The proportion of students without LD in the resilient and competent subgroups was similar to that of students with LD. The results suggest that the protective factors are important to the mental health of both students with and without LD. Academic and cognitive difficulties do not necessarily have negative effects on the mental health of all students with LD. Declining mental health can be prevented or slowed by using protective factors, which enable students with LD to achieve different adaptation results.In the results of direct model in students without LD, emotional self-concept, Chinese self-concept, self-efficacy, and peer support predicted their mental health; by contrast, in students with LD, emotional self-concept, self-efficacy, and peer support, as well as parental support, were positively correlated with mental health. In the indirect model of students without LD, selfefficacy served as a mediator between emotional self-concept and parental support for mental health, whereas for students with LD, self-efficacy partially mediated the relationship between parental support and mental health. The results of the direct model indicated that mental health was significantly associated with protective factors. Therefore, regardless of whether the students had LD or not, protective factors enhanced the mental health of individuals, although the key factors differed between the two groups. In the indirect model, the study results revealed the mediating effect of self-efficacy among students without LD on their mental health parameters, including physical self-concept, emotion self-concept, Chinese self-concept, parental support, and peer support. These parameters directly influence the individuals’ mental health and are associated with mental health through self-efficacy. Among students with LD, emotional self-concept and peer support had a direct positive correlation with their mental health, whereas parental support enhanced their mental health by bolstering their self-efficacy and, in turn, improving their mental health. Additionally, the physical and Chinese self-concepts only had a direct positive correlation with self-efficacy. Thus, the self-efficacy of the students with LD is crucial for their mental health. The results indicated that the protective factors of students with LD, such as social support and self-concepts, can enhance mental health. Finally, based on the results, this study proposes suggestions for future research and practice.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2951,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Suffering, Transformation, and Healing: a Situational Structure–Based Therapeutic Approach Developed Based on Daily Psychological Change",Yi-Jen Lu,"situational structure therapeutic approach, process of psychological change, existential phenomenology, counseling and psychotherapy","Suffering, transformation, and healing are key aspects of counseling and psychotherapy. In this study, we explored daily psychological change to develop corresponding therapeutic perspectives and frameworks. Empirical existential phenomenology studies on suffering and psychological change have revealed that an individual’s perception of suffering arises from the rejection of an existing situation and the unfeasibility of an expected situation to come into being; the disaccord between the existing and expected situations leads to a state of rootlessness. The steps involved in the transformation of suffering into healing are as follows:(1) The sufferer uses emotion as a tool to reflect on the feasibility of the original project and the meaning of the world.(2) The sufferer conceives of the experience of transformation as a process of learning, in which the key is to revise the original project and accept the world as a threat.(3) By perceiving transformation as learning in the context of painful emotions and accepting the new perspectives offered by others, the sufferer discovers that the unfamiliar situation they encounter differs from that encountered in the past and they start resolving the conflict between their past and present; this process includes the individual’s willingness to resolve their problems, a new understanding, and acceptance of their past, and a struggle to resolve the contradiction across the three dimensions of time: past, present, and future.(4) After the painful learning process, the sufferer is presented with new situations or possibilities and can commit to a new future.The aforementioned learning process has several therapeutic implications. First, individuals should view suffering as a problem that must be solved and develop an expectation that the problem can be solved. A problem indicates that the existing situation can no longer be explained or managed based on the individuals’ previous experience and they must develop another strategy to solve it. Expectation suggests that the sufferer is impatient with their current situation and must find another means to solve their problem. Therefore, at this stage of therapy, emotional exploration and determination should be the central aspects. Second, the process of learning involves a new understanding of the past, an exploration of future expectations, and an integration of the differences across the three dimensions of time. Therefore, therapists should not only help their patients to explore the past but should also discuss with them the past in the context of future expectations. During treatment in the present (now), the differences between the past and future dimensions should be resolved. At this stage, treatment should be focused on facilitating the emergence of “polysemy” in the patient’s situation. Third, learning is a process of problem-solving that involves perceiving previous experiences as false and developing the appropriate strategy to cope with a new situation. Therefore, while promoting the polysemization of their patient’s situation, a therapist should also explore how the patient responds to a situation and gradually revise the existing project of their clients. Finally, in the process of learning, the individuals who are suffering perceive and approach their problems based on similar problems encountered by others and their acceptance and recognition of their problems; thus, these individuals consider the external or existing theories as a new framework that enables them to understand everything that happens to them. Therefore, treatment should include the provision of a new perspective and framework to help the sufferer to understand their own experience differently. Therefore, therapists, like others, must facilitate self-reflection among their patients and provide a new framework or formal theory, thus helping the patient to reflect on themselves and use the new framework to understand their situation better. In addition, therapists should recognize, accept, and witness the improvement in their patients as they move toward a different future.In this study, a therapeutic perspective and framework were developed based on the theory of situational structure, which comprises situations and projects. A situational structure is not subjective because it involves people and tools other than oneself. These situations cannot be selected or controlled. However, the situational structure is not objective either because the situation is illuminated for individuals’ projection and the situational structure is unique across people and exists only for oneself. We can interpret the world and a situation in a certain manner, always projecting our next step and future. Fischer (1986) argued that a project is a basic unit and core construction of human psychology. Humans can be defined by a series of interrelated and sometimes discrepant projects. A project is “action from the past towards the future,” and projecting always relates to a situation. In situations, we make decisions and projects for the future; all our actions are bound within situations. Without reflection in our lives, we perceive situations as the cause and determinant of our actions; therefore, we often feel constrained and decisive by situations. Sartre (1943–2000) contended that a situation offers motives rather than causes. We tend to translate our factual understanding of ourselves into our situation. Our understanding of a situation is based on our previous and current experiences and forms the basis for our future actions. In this regard, a situation is a motive for future actions; an individual chooses to perceive a situation in a certain manner and respond to it. Therefore, in therapy, the situation is not considered a determinant of a patient’s behavior but rather a motivator. Understanding the deep context motivating their patient’s behavior may help therapists decipher what the patient is attempting to respond to through such behavior. Generally, a patient’s behavior is a response to their situation, although they may not be aware of it sometimes.The psychological distress associated with a humanistic orientation arises from the conflict between an individual’s project and the world in which they reside. Psychological distress may persist if one considers that the individual and the world are in an unchangeable fallen state. Symptoms and psychological distress are regarded as resulting from an individual’s lack of patience to remain in an unauthentic state. Therefore, symptoms and psychological distress indicate a desire to pursue authenticity and positive outcomes. Heidegger’s uncanny and Sartre’s bad faith were used to explore the meaning of suffering and develop a therapeutic approach based on existential phenomenology. This article describes the therapeutic significance of emotion, situation, and project in detail. In addition, a specific framework of treatment is proposed, which includes the following:(1) The meaning of experiencing suffering emotions is explored. Emotions indicate the pain experienced by individuals from remaining in their current situation and the expectation of overcoming the situation. The contradictory meaning of a situation can be understood only by considering the meaning of it vis-à-vis in terms of emotions.(2) A patient’s willingness to change must be strengthened. Through a discussion of the meaning of a situation based on emotions, therapists can help their patients view themselves as the cause of their actions, rather than as the result of their situation, and this can enhance the patient’s willingness to change.(3) Polysemization of the situation is essential. Through Sartre’s progressive–regressive method, therapists can discuss their patients’ situations across the three dimensions of time. Furthermore, the patients’ understanding of their situations can be polymerized through a discussion of existential anxiety and guilt.(4) The original project must be revised. Based on a new understanding of the past–present–future situation, therapists can discuss the dilemma or conflict in their patients’ situations and help develop a framework for the future that the patients can project concretely. Furthermore, healing is a process of transformation from inauthenticity to authenticity.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2950,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effect of Social Support on the Spiritual Health of Older Adults: Evaluation of the Mediation Effect,"Meng-Fan Li, Yang Shih","older adults, social support, spiritual health, mediation effect","The average life expectancy of humans is on the rise; however, the quality of life is more important than the length of life. Spiritual health is a part of an individual’s health and spiritual state; it refers to the dynamic process of balancing the internal and external states of an individual. The internal aspect of spiritual health refers to the integration of an individual’s past, present, and future and the balancing of the body, mind, and spirit. The external aspect of spiritual health is related to harmonious coexistence with other people, objects, and nature. The present study focused on the spiritual health status of older adults, which refers to the harmonious coexistence of person, community, and environment as well as transcendence. Establishing a harmony spiritual status is particularly important, while older adults may face many life events, such retirement, disease, disability, widowhood, …etc. during their old age life. In a near future super-aged society, spiritual health is regarded as a key aspect of holistic care.Social support is a vital resource for older adults. It is the state in which individuals feel, perceive, accept care, or receive assistance from others in their support network. The main effects model suggests that regardless of the level of pressure, such as disease, retirement, widowhood, social support confers certain benefits in terms of improved physical and mental well-being. Relevant studies have validated that social support exerts a positive and direct effect on the quality of life of older adults. In this study, social support was categorized into four types: emotional, tangible, informational, and esteem support. Older adults were requested to self-assess their subjective feelings about each of the aforementioned types of social support.Social support reportedly enhances well-being in older adults. Studies have been conducted focusing primarily on the effect of social support on physical or mental health. Some studies have highlighted that a social support network functions as a mediator that affects the life satisfaction of older adults; it also reduces depression among these people, particularly due to the emotional support entailed by social support. The study was conducted because of the lack of relevant studies on the effect of social support on the spiritual health of older adults in Taiwan. We further evaluated the possible mediation effect of social support on factors influencing the spiritual health of older adults.This study included community-dwelling older adults aged ≥ 65 years who were living in Taipei City. Stratified random sampling was performed in 12 administrative districts. A total of 24 community senior care centers were randomly selected in consideration of the proportion of such centers in each district. For each of these centers, a particular number of samples was determined based on the total number of participants. The participants provided signed informed consent before the commencement of this study.Basic personal variables–independent variables–included the following influential parameters identified through a review of the empirical literature: religious beliefs, self-evaluated economic status, and perceived health status. Social support was used as a mediation variable to investigate its possible mediation effect. The survey was conducted between September and November 2019. A total of 425 questionnaires were distributed and 325 valid ovies were returned (recovery rate, 76.5%). A structural equation model was used in this study to evaluate the possible mediation effect of social support on factors influencing the spiritual health of older adults.The Social Support Scale, which is a modified version of the scale developed by Iwasaki and Mannel (2000), was used in the present study to assess the level of social support received by the study participants. This scale is divided into four dimensions–informational, esteem, tangible, and emotional support–and comprises a total of 14 questions. The responses are recorded on a 7-point scale, where a score of 1 indicates the strongest disagreement and that of 7 indicates the strongest agreement. Total mean scores were calculated for each dimension; a higher score indicated a higher level of social support. The results of confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the average variance extracted (AVE) value of each subscale was .63- .80, with an overall score of .78, and the composite reliability (CR) value was .84- .94, with an overall score of .93.Spiritual Health Scale for the Taiwanese Elderly (Li & Shih, 2021), which has four dimensions (personal, communal, environmental, and transcendental domains), was used in this study to evaluate the spiritual health of the study participants. The results of confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the AVE value of each subscale was between .61 and .79, with an overall score of .77, and the CR value was between .82 and .92, with an overall score of .93. Both of the aforementioned scales exhibited good reliability and validity.The results of the study demonstrated that the structural model fit appropriately and met the standard. The results of path analysis revealed that the primary factors influencing the spiritual health of perceived older adults were social support and religious belief. Overall social support exerted a positive effect on the spiritual health of older adults; it completely mediated the effect of self-evaluated economic status on spiritual health and partially mediated that of perceived health status. Future studies must give special consideration to economic status when investigating the spiritual health of older adults. Furthermore, esteem support, which is a sub-dimension of social support, exerted the highest level of effect on spiritual health. It completely mediated the effect of self-evaluated economic status on spiritual health and partially mediated those of perceived health status and religious belief. Finally, having or not having a religious belief directly affected the spiritual health of older adults. Only esteem support partially mediated the effect of religious belief on the spiritual health of older adults.This study suggests that older adults, who receive esteem, emotional, and informational supports from their social network, can have better spiritual health. Gerontological and family education for family members, professional elder service providers, and volunteers, can emphasize on the importance, the meaning, and value of social supports for older adults. The community senior care centers can provide a friendly climate and environment through an understanding of older adults’ life experience with multidimensional supports.As noted, religious belief directly affects the spiritual health of older adults; however, it exerts no significant effect on the sub-dimensions of social support, except for esteem support. Therefore, older adults could be encouraged to cultivate a religious belief and participate spiritual activities that accord with their worldview. In addition, they could be motivated to explore the deeper meaning of life and death, which will help improve their spiritual health.Future studies should include older adults from both urban and rural communities and compare these communities in terms of the effects of social support on the spiritual health of older adults. Furthermore, whether the reciprocity of social support affects the spiritual health of community-dwelling older adults must be investigated.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2954,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Validation of an Adolescent Resilience Scale,"Chia-Chi Shen, Hsin-Yi Lien","adolescent, resilience, gender","Psychological resilience can be defined as the capacity to cope with challenges. In adolescents, resilience involves response and protective factors they exercise when confronting difficulties. In the past two decades, resilience during adolescence has gained considerable research attention. However, most relevant studies in Taiwan have employed translated or revised non-Taiwanese scales with high reliability and validity to measure resilience among adolescents. Furthermore, few resilience scales targeting factors specific to junior high school students have been reported in Taiwan. The current study filled this gap by developing an adolescent resilience scale (ARS) and then verifying its reliability and validity. It also explored the adolescent resilience differences associated with individual variables such as age and gender.We employed the qualitative and quantitative methods and developed the ARS in the three phases: an open-ended questionnaire, a pilot test, and a formal test. All three phases were included to ensure the reliability and validity of not only the pilot but also the final version of the ARS.In the first phase, we applied convenience sampling to recruit 80 adolescents from two junior high schools in Northern Taiwan. After the exclusion of 18 questionnaires for incomplete data, we included 50 valid responses from 23 boys and 27 girls, with an 85% recovery rate. The questionnaire items included “What personality traits or abilities have helped you cope with difficulties?” “What strategies do you apply to solve problems, and why?” “What stops you from quitting learning when things get tough?” Next, we applied the inductive method to generate items from the obtained responses. Keywords and significant phrases related to adolescent resilience were summarized and generalized. They were then categorized into six factors: Show of Empathy (putting yourself in someone else’s position and understanding the difficulty of others), Problem-Solving Competency (hard work, persistence, responsibility, and problem-solving), Self-Emotion Regulation (calmness and self-encouragement), Establishment of Life Goals (living up to expectations, planning for the future, and goal achievement), Competence Perception (independence, self-confidence, strength, ability to face challenges, and bravery), and Awareness of Positive Support (encouragement from friends and parents and help from teachers). We used the extracted keywords and phrases to draft a pilot ARS questionnaire, containing 53 items, rated on a 5-point Likert scale–with 1 indicating “completely disagree” and 5 indicating “completely agree”; higher the score, the higher was the level of resilience.In the second phase, the pilot ARS questionnaire was distributed to 200 grade 8 and 9 students in a junior high school in Taiwan based on convenience sampling. Consequently, we obtained 145 valid samples from 52 grade 8 students and 93 grade 9 students (recovery rate = 83.8%; 69 boys and 76 girls). The data were analyzed using SPSS Amos (version 26; IBM). We performed item discrimination analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and reliability analysis to evaluate the internal consistency reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Item analysis was performed using corrected item–total correlation and the significance of the mean item difference of the top 27% and bottom 27% of the data was determined using a t test. Two items with a critical ratio of < 3 and one item with item–total correlation of < 0.4 were excluded to increase the overall Cronbach’s α. Our EFA results confirmed the factor structure of the ARS. A high Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO; 0.922) indicated the suitability of the data for EFA, and a χ2 of 6173.745 (p < 0.001) proved the factorability of the data. In the EFA, all 23 items were subjected to principal component analysis, and only the final six factors were able to explain 66.363% of the total variance. After repeated EFA, all 23 items (representing all six factors; KMO = 0.918, χ2 = 2227.545, p < 0.001) could explain 74.489% of the total variance. The factor loadings ranged from 0.562 to 0.816, indicating that all items were good measures of their respective factors. All factors were internally consistent (α = 0.946) as well.In the third phase, we distributed 1,600 of the final questionnaire to grade 7–9 students from five junior high schools. We collected 1,513 valid responses from 546 grade 7, 419 grade 8, and 548 grade 9 students (recovery rate = 94.6%; 730 boys and 783 girls). The data were analyzed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and cross-validation to verify the validity of the final version of the ARS. The data of the 1513 samples were randomly split in half. The first half (N = 756), considered an estimate sample, was subjected to CFA, whereas the second half (N = 757), considered a validity sample, was subjected to cross-validation. The CFA results for all items indicated that the model demonstrated a good fit [comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.95, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.05, Tucker–Lewis index (TLI) = 0.94, goodness of fit index (GFI) = 0.93] and was free from offending estimates. The internal consistency estimates in scale construction were satisfactory. The correlation analysis demonstrated a consistent pattern of relationships, suggesting convergent and discriminant validity. Next, to confirm the stability of the scale for different samples, the second half of the sample (N = 757) was analyzed through crossvalidation. The results demonstrated a good data fit in the resilience model (χ2 = 726.844, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.93, RMSEA = 0.05, TLI = 0.91, GFI = 0.92). As such, both CFA and EFA indicated that the 23-item ARS, with a 6-factor structure, has good construct validity for our single factor model.Significant age differences were observed in the overall ARS scores and scores on the Show of Empathy, Self-Emotion Regulation, and Establishment of Life Goals subscales. Specifically, the grade 7 students scored higher on the subscales than did the grade 8 and 9 students. Although no sex differences were found on the overall ARS score, the girls scored significantly higher on the Show of Empathy subscale, whereas the boys scored significantly higher in the Self-Emotion Regulation subscale. Moreover, the Show of Empathy subscale scores did not increase with age; nevertheless, it was the highest in the girls in grade 9 but the lowest in the boys in grade 8. The Self-Emotion Regulation subscale scores decreased with aged in the girls but not in the boys; moreover, the Self-Emotion Regulation scores were the highest in boys in the grade 7 boys but the lowest in the grade 9 girls.In conclusion, our results indicated that our 23-item 6-domain ARS is a reliable and valid instrument for the measurement of adolescent resilience and these subfactors: show of empathy, problem-solving competency, self-emotion regulation, establishment of life goals, competence perception, and positive support awareness. The ARS’s psychometric properties, structural validity and internal consistency reliability, were explored. The results demonstrated that the ARS has great reliability and validity and thus is recommended for analyzing adolescent resilience. In the present study, we focused on the effects of individual traits related to resilience. Future studies including environmental factors, such as those related to peers, family, school, community, and society, which also influence adolescent resilience, are warranted. Moreover, these studies may involve individual personalities as inner protective factors and add external protective factors and risk factors for a more comprehensive understanding of adolescent resilience. Other future research directions include expanding the study scope to participants from different cultures, age groups, or socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, in future, we will expand on the current results by clarifying the effects of local Chinese cultures on adolescent resilience.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2949,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development of a Positive Learning Motivation Scale for Junior and Senior High School Students,"Szu-Yu Lai, Lee-Chou Chen, Han-Ju Ho","learning motivation, learning emotions, optimistic, learning hardwork, learning resilience","Positive psychology is essential for learning attitudes, methods, and strategies in terms of learning motivation and learning emotion. A scientific perspective can increase the value of a learning life; it is also crucial for adaptability and flexibility because coping with learning challenges requires the knowledge and ability as well as a positive attitude. Many researchers have investigated the learning process of junior and senior high school students by using a positive learning motivation assessment, but their methodology had several limitations. For instance, many of the studies included a negative description (e.g., a heavy course load increases stress) or focused on negative mental states (e.g., learning burnout and alienated relationships). The implementation of education reform cannot alleviate the learning pressure of middle school students, and more than half of junior and senior high school students are negatively affected by “schoolwork pressure” and “exam pressure,” decreasing their mental health and learning motivation. In Taiwan, research on positive learning is lacking. Research on positive learning motivation includes learning attitudes, learning methods and strategies, learning hard work, learning emotions, responsibility, optimism, and resilience. In positive psychology research, additional investigation may provide more reasons for the cultivation of positive learning motivation. Therefore, this study developed a Positive Learning Motivation Scale (PLMS) to measure the index of learning incentive for junior and senior high school students for incorporating positive learning motivation as an indicator of the learning phenomenon. This study also analyzed the essential nature of optimism and learning resilience among students.Learning motivation is the driving force of learning. Motivation is an essential factor in the success or failure of learning among students, indicating that motivation has a profound impact on positive learning. In the learning process, positive emotions make learners emotionally stable, active and interested in learning, able to concentrate, stimulate personal potential, become dynamic and innovative in learning, and enhance their sense of achievement in learning. Our PLMS multidimensionally assesses students’ learning motivation and learning emotion such as learning effort and strategy (e.g., understanding hard work and good learning emotions) and learning resilience (e.g., responsibility, optimism, and empathy–cooperation). We designed this assessment instrument for junior and senior high school (grade 7–12) students. The PLMS scale items were designed as theoretically constructed questions. The relevant theories and literature on positive learning in PLMS have confirmed the definition of positive learning, and then the item structure of the relevant scales was designed. For the compilation of the PLMS, scale items were generated based on schoolteachers’ suggestions; here, the themes of the PLMS were prepared and classified. The relevant theories and literature on positive learning were analyzed, and the definition of positive learning was confirmed. Then, the item structure of the relevant scales was designed to determine the junior and senior high school students in the north, middle, and second districts as the participants of the preliminary test. Next, the initial test questions were subjected to item and factor analyses. The test questions with research and identification index of > 3 and consistency score between the test** questions of > 0.3 were selected. Next, we performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA), screened the questions, determined the eligible test questions, collected samples for formal testing, and performed statistical analysis on the test results. The test–retest reliability and the criteria of the validity correlation test were established 3 weeks apart. The posttest results were subjected to multiple regression analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and criterion-related validity analysis to explore the sex and age differences in each subscale.In total, 1056 students participated in the pretest study. On the basis of the results of item analysis and EFA, “ the context item are learning hard work,” “learning emotions,” “responsibility,” “optimism,” and “empathy–cooperation ” fulfill a formal scale. The scale used here had 36 self-reported items, rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale. In total, 4,086 junior and senior high school students were used as samples.The PLMS used for analyzing the learning motivation and learning emotions of junior and senior high school students also used a 4-point Likert-type scale. Here, the higher the score, the better the positive learning. The PLMS, including 36 questions, required 10–15 minutes to complete.Our results indicated that the PLMS has significant criteria-related validity for items related to factors, such as positive mental health and emotional intelligence. The average score for learning emotion was the highest, indicating that when junior and senior high school students develop learning motivation, learning emotion warrants special attention. The study results also demonstrated that the students’ resilience positively affects education and that those with high resilience can respond to events and have more positive interpersonal skills. Among middle school students, we also found significant age and sex differences in positive learning. Our results suggested that positive learning should use strategies to improve students’ ability to perform various activities and aid them in self-resilience development. Positive learning is associated with resilience because it can optimistically predict learning tasks, particularly the ability to maintain mental health. Because learners with high resilience will be more concerned about self-ability, they may make more effort and demonstrate perseverance and thus have improved academic control. In this study, we aimed to understand positive learning in junior and senior high school students by developing the PLMS.Our results may aid the design of efficient teaching activities to cultivate positive understanding. The reliability and validity of the PLMS can provide auxiliary applications in education, counseling, and life education. In terms of education, it examines the academic and life knowledge as well as the skills of middle school students, facilitating the development of their learning motivation or learning resilience and the design of an effective learning and teaching plan for them. In terms of counseling, the parents and teachers of middle school students can use the PLMS to determine the positive knowledge so that these teachers and parents can have a deeper understanding of this aspect. The PLMS results can be employed in assisted living and counseling materials to aid middle school students in exploring their strengths and thinking.The internal consistency of the PLMS for junior and senior high school students was satisfactory. The construct validity of the PLMS, detected using CFA, indicated an acceptable model fit. The correlation results demonstrated that a high PLMS score was related to positive mental health, interpersonal relationships, and emotional intelligence. Moreover, the psychometric evaluation by using the PLMS demonstrated statistically reliable and valid results. In this research, we adopted the perspective of positive psychology; focused on learning motivation, learning emotion, and resilience; and developed a positive learning scale for junior and senior high school students. In general, the PLMS results may provide evidence supporting learning and relevant practical research interventions and reference for counseling junior and senior high school students to improve positive learning motivation.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2956,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Romantic Involvement on Adolescents’ Cognitive and Noncognitive Skills: Evidence from China Education Panel Survey,"Weixiang Luo, Mengke Zhao, Yongai Jin","romantic involvement, adolescent, cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills, propensity score weighting","In Western countries, romantic relationships are part of the typical adolescence experience, whereas in China, adolescent romantic relationships are disparaged as “puppy love” and often considered far from malapropos (Li et al., 2010; Liu & Li, 2015; Shi, 2016). In general, Chinese parents and teachers hold conservative values toward adolescent dating because they believe that adolescent romance leads to various adverse outcomes, particularly poor academic performance. Here we analyzed whether puppy love negatively affects adolescents’ cognitive and noncognitive development in China.Thus far, numerous studies have focused on adolescent romantic relationships in China (for reviews, see Liu & Li, 2015; Shi, 2016). However, some relevant major research gaps and questions warrant further research. First, most studies on the consequences of adolescent romance thus far have been limited by their reliance on speculative discussion or case analysis. Although few studies have quantitatively analyzed the role of romantic relationship in adolescent development, they have used data that are not nationally representative (Chen et al., 2009; Li et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019; Zhou et al., 2000). Moreover, they have failed to examine the mechanisms linking adolescent dating to individual development.Second, few studies have used statistical analyses to explicitly resolve the endogeneity problem related to the adolescent dating–individual development association. Adolescents with dating behaviors form a specific population. Whether an adolescent engages in romantic relationships depends on his/her individual and social characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and parental marital status). The systematic differences between adolescents with and without romantic experience can confound the causal effects of romantic relationships. In other words, to estimate the causal effects of adolescent romantic involvement, the underlying selection bias should be considered.In this study, we stated and tested a series of hypotheses regarding the effects of adolescent romantic relationships on individual cognitive and noncognitive skill development. This study aims to expand the current knowledge in this area in several aspects. First, in contrast to previous studies, we evaluated the effect of adolescent romance quantitively by using nationally representative data along with a selection bias mitigation method (i.e., propensity score weighting). We also distinguished light and heavy involvement in romance among adolescents and thus presented a more detailed depiction of the consequences of romantic involvement on adolescent development than the previous studies have provided. In our analyses, we explored the role of study time in mediating the effects of romantic involvement on cognitive and noncognitive skills. Finally, we explored the roles of social context (i.e., parents’, teachers’, and peers’ attitudes toward adolescent romantic relationships) in conditioning the relationship of romantic involvement with cognitive and noncognitive skills in adolescents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically estimate the causal effects of romantic relationship on cognitive and noncognitive skill adolescent development.In this study, we analyzed data from China Education Panel Survey (CEPS)—which is an ongoing, large-scale, and nationally representative longitudinal survey, conducted by National Survey Research Center (NSRC) at Renmin University of China. Currently, two waves of CEPS data are publicly available: baseline and Year 1 follow-up. In the baseline survey during 2013–2014, the CEPS interviewed two cohorts: grade 7 and 9 students. Follow-up survey during 2014–2015 tracked all the original grade 7 students in the baseline survey. We restricted our data analysis to the grade 8 students in the Year 1 follow-up survey because the CEPS did not collect information on adolescent romance in the baseline survey. After exclusion of cases with invalid or incomplete data, our analytical sample comprised 4,400 boys and 4,219 girls, of which 605 and 402 had a romantic experience, respectively.The adolescents self-reported their relationship status (ever dated, or never dated). Those with a romantic experience were further classified into two groups: those engaged in only light sexual activities (i.e., confined to holding hands) and those engaged in heavy sexual activities (i.e., kissing, other more intimate physical contacts, or both). Cognitive skills were analyzed on the basis of the scores on the cognitive ability test as well as those on Chinese language, English language, and math midterm tests, all of which were standardized within the class. Noncognitive skills were assessed on the basis of self-efficiency, depression, confidence in the future, educational expectation, and learning attitudes.To estimate the causal effects of romantic involvement in adolescents, we used propensity score weighting, controlling for selection assignment differences between adolescents with and without a romantic experience. With this approach, all adolescents in this study could be used for outcome evaluation. To explore the mediating roles of study time, we used the Karlson–Holm–Breen (KHB) method to decompose the total effect of romantic involvement into direct effects and indirect (i.e., mediating) effects (Breen et al., 2013). To explore the influence of parents’/teachers’ and peers’ attitudes in conditioning the relationship between romantic involvement and development outcomes, we employed multivariate statistical models with interactions between their attitudes and romantic involvement.A key finding of this research was that in China, the influence of adolescent romantic involvement is generally negative. Specifically, compared with adolescents with no romantic experience, those with at least some romantic experience had lower levels of cognitive and noncognitive skills. As adolescents become intimate and committed in their relationships, they may begin to experience the related adverse effects. These findings are consistent with evidence from studies on adolescents in Western societies (Connolly & Johnson, 1996; Furman & Collibee, 2014; Furman et al., 2009; Giordano et al., 2008; Joyner & Udry, 2000; Neemann et al., 1995; Orpinas et al., 2013; Schmidt & Lockwood, 2017; Zimmer-Gembeck et al., 2001).Moreover, regarding the association of romantic involvement with cognitive stills, study time is a crucial mediator in adolescents, through which romantic relationships undermine their cognitive skills. Regarding the process of contextual influences, parents’ or teachers’ disapproval can increase the detrimental effects of romantic involvement, particularly in girls, probably because it leads to additional stress in dating adolescents. In general, our findings somewhat support developmental task theory (Roisman et al., 2009): romantic relationship is not a salient task during adolescence. Romantic involvement might distract adolescents from their current essential tasks, such as schoolwork. Our findings also support social timetable theory (Elder, 1995; Rook et al., 1989), which highlights the timing of major life events. In China, dating is considered an activity performed during adulthood rather than during adolescence. Therefore, parents and teachers interfere with adolescents’ involvement in romantic relationships.Finally, our results indicate that the negative effects of romantic involvement are generally more pronounced among girls than among boys, particularly in terms of academic performance. A possible reason for this result is that in a relationship, girls are relatively dependent and empathy for others, whereas boys tend to be independent and focus on satisfaction (Seiffge & Krenke, 2011; Wang et al., 2021). Another possible reason is that when confronting interpersonal stresses, girls are more likely to avoid coping strategies than boys are (Grant et al., 2006; Seiffge-Krenke & Klessinger, 2000). In girls, higher sensitivity to relationship stress, combined with their avoidance coping style, can reduce their sense of control and potentially threaten their well-being and development.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2955,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Are New Immigrant Women Accepted? Multicultural Acceptance and Its Influencing Factors: A Case Study of the Kinmen Area,"Cheng-Chung Cho, Rui-Hsin Kao","new immigrants, multicultural acceptance, social distance, contacting frequency","Taiwan is one of the most preferred destinations for foreign immigrant workers and marriage immigrants. In January 2021, the number of marriage immigrants was 560,617, a number representing 2.38% of Taiwan’s population. Of them, 368,237 spouses were from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, and they accounted for 65.68% of marriage immigrants; this number was followed by that for Vietnamese spouses, who accounted for 19.60% of marriage immigrants (Ministry of the Interior National Immigration Agency Republic of China, Taiwan, 2021. In an earlier era, most marriage immigrants in Taiwan were women, who were referred to as “foreign brides” from underdeveloped Asian countries. Their marriages were often simplistically understood as “mercenary marriages” (Hsia, 2001), reflecting the stereotype and prejudice of some Taiwanese people toward marriage immigrants.In the patrilineal tradition of Chinese society, having a daughter-in-law had a stronger impact on the family than having a daughter get married. The attitude of parents toward their sons marrying foreign women (including women from mainland China) indicates not only the acceptance level of the families but also the perspectives of society. Additionally, newlywed brides are expected to adapt to their new environment (Yi & Chang, 2006).Some studies have investigated the attitude of Taiwanese people toward marriage immigrant women. The proportion of people having an accepting toward marriage immigrants from mainland China and Southeast Asian countries considerably increased between 2004 and 2014 (Chen & Wu, 2017).According to the aforementioned studies, the acceptance of new immigrant women has increased in Taiwan, mostly because of social contact with and appreciation of the value of said women (Chen & Wu, 2017). A few studies have explored whether Taiwanese people have prejudices toward or stereotypes of new immigrant women, whether differences in social status between people have decreased, and whether Taiwanese people have become increasingly accepting of people from various cultures; the results of these studies have revealed various findings. A study that recruited college students (Kim et al., 2018) revealed that the participants had relatively positive stereotypes toward new immigrant women but their views were linked to the nationality of the immigrants. For example, they had a positive perception of new immigrant residents from Japan and Korea, but their perspective regarding those from Southeast Asian countries and mainland China was negative. A study titled “Out of Place: The Double Absence of Vietnam Marriage Immigrants” (Kung, 2019, p.69) reported “linguistic challenges, commercialized marriage as a symbolic violence, and negative transnationalism from the suffering experience of Vietnam women, including lonely, intimate discontents, uncivil attention, and betrayal.” These findings suggest that the acceptance of marriage immigrants in Taiwan should be further explored.This study explored the multicultural acceptance, related factors, and the cognitive gap between new immigrants and college students. The causes of prejudice, stereotypes, and social distance among college students were investigated to determine whether people really accept new immigrants. Hagendoorn and Kleinpenning (1991) proposed that people have different stereotypes toward ethnic minorities under different circumstances and these differences affect the social distance from ethnic minorities. They also reported that the stereotypes of people toward certain groups or members were related to prejudice to some extent, regardless of the measuring methods (Damigella & Licciardello, 2014). Choi et al. (2017) suggested the possibility of a direct correlation between stereotypes and social distancing. Moreover, prejudice is notably implicit toward certain ethnic groups that are conceptualized on the basis of several stereotypes—for example, African Americans.Overall, stereotyping is a basic cognitive attitude that entails beliefs regarding a certain social group and its members, and prejudice is a negative emotional attitude. Stereotypes and prejudice are correlated with each other and affect the social distance from ethnic minorities (Xue, 2017). Moreover, a certain stereotype toward certain groups and their members would also involve prejudice (Evans & Need, 2002).Park and Lee (2013) reported that the major factors influencing multicultural acceptance include self-respect, social support, national consciousness, and social distance, with social distance having the most notable influence. They found that the lower the social distance is, the higher the multicultural acceptance is. Kim and Ahn (2014) demonstrated that stereotypes and prejudice are the major factors affecting the multicultural acceptance of university students toward immigrant workers from Southeast Asian countries. Jeong (2014) used social population variables (including gender, grade, cross-cultural friendship), contact experience, and social distance as variables and discovered that stereotypes and prejudice affect social distance, which further influences multicultural acceptance. Contact experience can include formal (multicultural course in school) or informal (community activity, media, etc.) contact. Kao (2014) reported that people could eliminate certain prejudices and discrimination toward Chinese immigrants and increase multicultural acceptance through introspection and discussion, learning to respect and appreciate the differences in culture. Kim et al. (2018) inferred that compared with students who did not have any experience abroad, those with such experience possessed more cross-cultural communication skills. Moreover, students with cross-cultural contact experience are less likely to exhibit prejudices or stereotypes or to keep a wary social distance.This study adopted the questionnaire survey method to obtain research data on college students and new immigrants in Kinmen. Two questionnaires were used: the first questionnaire was used to sample 400 college students and 269 new immigrants, and the second questionnaire was used to confirm the factors (reasons, impressions, and prejudices) that influence the willingness (most willing or least willing) of college students to intermarry with individuals of other nationalities.This study analyzed various data and tested the research hypothesis through frequency distribution, Pearson correlation, reliability analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis. In addition, a Likert 5-point scale was employed to measure the variables. The scale comprised the following five degrees: “Strongly disagree,” “Disagree,” “Neither Agree or Disagree,” “Agree,” and “Strongly agree.” The variable scores represented the respondents’ stereotypes, prejudices, contact experience, perception of social distance, and multicultural acceptance. For the variables, higher scores corresponded to stronger recognition of the assessment items.The results indicated that college students’ overall stereotype toward new immigrants is positive. Multicultural acceptance of new immigrants is also considerably high among college students. Moreover, the perceptions of most variables notably differed among the students, except for the variable of prejudice. The nationalities that the college students were most willing to intermarry with were Japanese, Korean, American (USA), Australian, and European, with the general reason being “higher living standard.” The students were least willing to marry with Southeast Asian and mainland Chinese individuals. The major reasons for less willingness to marry those from Southeast Asian countries were the differences in living habits and culture and lower living standard. The key reasons for the unwillingness to intermarry with mainland Chinese individuals were political consciousness, inability to bring benefits to the respondent or their family, and poor political relations between the two sides of the Strait. Therefore, the findings of this study revealed reasons for the low willingness to intermarry. Overall, the first questionnaire revealed the cognitive attitude of college students toward the research variables and the differences in attitude between college students and new immigrants; the second questionnaire confirmed the reasons, stereotypes, and prejudices that influence the willingness (most willing or least willing) of college students to marry individuals of other nationalities.Based on the findings of Kim et al. (2018) and Kao (2018), this study applied more rigorous research methods to further explore the cognitive differences between college students and new immigrants due to prejudice, stereotypes, social distance, and multicultural acceptance. In addition, through in-depth interviews with the participants and two questionnaire surveys, multiple demographic variables and analytic methods were applied to discern the reasons for cognitive differences between college students and new immigrants.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2957,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploration of the Relationships between new Immigrants´ Children and Different Creativities: The Mediating Role of Cultural Distance,"Ping-Hsun Tsai, Te-Wei Chiu, Yu-Lin Chang, Jen-Ho Chang, Hsueh-Chih Chen","new immigrants’ children, cultural distance, open-ended creativity, closed-ended creativity","In recent years, the number of new immigrants’ children has been increasing. Recent research suggested that the number of children from bicultural families in Taiwan increases year by year (Ministry of Education, 2019); especially for middle school students. According to the Ministry of Education, the proportion of children of new residents in the middle school education settings has exceeded 10% (Ministry of Education in Taiwan, 2019). Past studies consistently revealed that the new immigrants’ children had lower academic performance than Han’s children. However, they had better creative performance due to their multicultural environment. For example, Chen (2010–2011) and Chang et al. (2014) found that middle school students from new immigrant families have a stable advantage in creative performance. This result also supports the argument that multiculturalism promotes creativity.However, some issues need to be clarified. First, these studies mostly regarded the new residents of different ethnic groups as the same group. They did not classify them according to regional culture, nor did they consider the impact of differences in their cultural distance. According to the “experience of social diversity theory” of Gocłowska and Crisp (2014), not all multicultural experiences can positively impact individual creativity. Some factors that affect the quality of multicultural experiences need to be considered, such as cultural distance. Cultural distance refers to the degree of value diversity between an individual’s two cultures. When the cultural distance is appropriate, the individual will have the opportunity to experience the conflict between the two cultural values and integrate values and bicultural identity. In this study, we used the objective cultural distance established by Hofstede and Bond (1984) and Hofstede et al. (2010) as an indicator of cultural distance. It constructs a database of cultures of various countries by comparing six critical cultural dimensions: individualism vs. collectivism (IDV), masculinity vs. femininity (MAS), and long-term orientation vs. short-term orientation (LTO), power distance index (PDI), uncertainty avoidance (UAI), and indulgence vs. restraint (IVR). As a standard to measure the cultural differences and value orientations of different countries.Second, in terms of measuring the creative potential of general participants, it can be broadly divided into open-ended divergent thinking tests and closed-ended creative problem-solving. Past studies often used a single creativity index to analogize all creativity performance. However, many studies have shown that different creativity tasks differ in the nature of the tasks (e.g., Wakefield, 1989) and involve different processes (Lin et al., 2012; Lin & Lien, 2013). In summary, these studies did not consider the new immigrants’ cultural differences, and most of them only used a single type of creativity assignment as an indicator, resulting in divergent results and unable to reach a consistent and complete conclusion. Thus, in the present study, we distinguished new immigrants students from different cultural distances (Southeast Asian immigrants/China immigrants) and various types of creativity (closed/open-end creativity). In addition, previous studies have shown that students’ learning achievements and family social and economic backgrounds are positively associated with creativity (e.g., Dai et al., 2012). To avoid these confounding variables, we also measure and control students’ academic performance and family socioeconomic status. Finally, we used 472 middle school students (102 new immigrants: 49 Southeast Asian immigrants/53 China immigrants) to examine the differences of these students in their background variables (family background/academic performance) and different types of creativity (closed/open-end creativity). We expected that cultural distance would be related to greater creativity.The participants’ ethnic group (Han children: both parents are Taiwanese, and new immigrant children: one or more of their parents are from China or Southeast Asia) are used as prediction variables. Participants’ closed-end creativity task: Insight problem and open-end creativity task: Divergent thinking task are the criterion variables. In addition, the participants’ “parental socioeconomic status,” “parental education level,” and “academic performance” are control variables.Consistent with past research, the results showed that children from new immigrant backgrounds were inferior to Hans children in family background variables such as parental socioeconomic status and parental education level. However, in terms of academic performance, when we distinguished the children of new residents from different ethnic groups, only Southeast Asian immigrants performed worse. In contrast, China immigrants were closer to Han’s children. In terms of creativity, after controlling for background variables, the creative advantages of the two groups of new immigrants’ children were only shown in the open-ended creativity task. Southeast Asian immigrants had a better trend in terms of flexibility and originality. China immigrants had the most advantage in originality. In summary, we found that immigrant children’s strengths in creativity mainly appear in the performance of open-end creativity, and their advantages are not the same for students from China and Southeast Asian backgrounds. In terms of cultural distance, through the Hofstede objective cultural distance calculation formula, the cultural distance of the new ethnic groups of each nationality was finally calculated. According to the near-far value: Indonesia (43.97), China (55.82), Vietnam (56.49), Thailand (62.67), Malaysia (75.68), Philippines (83.14). Overall, the objective cultural distance of new residents in Southeast Asia (average cultural distance = 64.82) was farther than that of new residents in China (cultural distance = 55.82). This result was also similar to the previous literature.The correlation analysis between cultural distance and the two types of creativity showed that ethnic cultural distance was only positively correlated with open-end creativity, but not related to close-end creativity. In other words, cultural distance is more related to open-end creativity. More importantly, through mediation analysis, we found that cultural distance plays an important role between new immigrant children and open-end creativity. Mediation analyses revealed that cultural distance mediated the influence of new immigrants on open-end creativity (fluency). This result highlighted the influence of cultural background and values on the creative performance of new immigrants’ children. This also supports the theory of social experience diversity (Gocłowska & Crisp, 2014).In addition, although China immigrants are closer to the Han’s children in cultural distance, they still had better originality performance (open-end creativity). Through additional mediation analysis, we also found that the superior performance of language subjects (Chinese and English) contributes to their originality. We propose a possible explanation. China immigrants and the local students are culturally close, especially the common language system, so that their performance in language subjects is the same as that of ordinary students. This also means that for China immigrants, in addition to multicultural experience, the convenience of a common language may also contribute to the advantage of open-end creativity indicators.This study reveals the influence of cultural distance on the creativity of new inhabitant school children and supports the multicultural experience of Gocłowska and Crisp (2014). If future research can be based on this, it will be more comprehensive and in-depth on the various psychological value conflicts caused by different cultural distances on new residents and school children and analyze the process and factors of its impact. It will help the creative development of children of all ethnic groups in Taiwan’s diverse society and exploring the strength of new residents’ children, and enhancing their outstanding performance and motivation. It can also serve as a niche for domestic multicultural education.In conclusion, this research can clarify the relationship between multiculturalism and creativity and make recommendations based on the research results to become the basis for subsequent research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2958,54.1,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Systematic Review of Eye-Tracking Studies on Text- Diagram Science Reading,"Tzu-Ning Wang, Yu-Cin Jian","systematic review, text-diagram science reading, eye-tracking, reading process","Text and diagrams are frequently presented together in science textbooks and popular science articles. Text is used to describe concepts, and diagrams contain visual and spatial information depicting conceptual relationships, object structures, and developmental processes. Two primary theoretical models have been widely adopted by researchers in the domain of text–diagram comprehension: Mayer’s cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML; Mayer, 2005, 2014) and Schnotz’s integrated model of text and picture comprehension (ITPC; Schnotz & Bannert, 2003; Schnotz et al., 2014). In contrast to findings of benefits associated with Mayer’s “multimedia principle” (Mayer, 2005, 2014), several studies have documented neutral or negative learning effects from studying images (McTigue, 2009; Segers et al., 2008). Previous literature reviews on text–diagram reading have either been published more than 10 years ago (Carney & Levin, 2002; Phillips et al., 2010; Vekiri, 2002) or mostly focused on offline outcome measures (Carney & Levin, 2002; Guo et al., 2020; Phillips et al., 2010; Schnotz, 2014), which may not reflect the complexity of text–diagram processing. Empirical evidence of eye movements during text– diagram reading has been obtained in several studies, but no systematic review has been conducted to synthesize these findings. This systematic review was designed to synthesize the empirical research findings of eye-tracking studies in the domain of text–diagram science reading over the past 30 years. The three specific research questions were the following: a. What are the readers’ eye movement patterns, and what is the relationship between these patterns and learning performance in text–diagram science reading? b. How and under what conditions do potential influencing factors affect readers’ eye movement patterns and performance in text–diagram science reading? c. Can interventions affect eye movement patterns and performance in text–diagram science reading? A systematic literature review was conducted using a methodological three-step process (Guo et al., 2020). a. Identifying and searching articles published between January 1990 and May 2020 in Scopus, Education Database (ProQuest), ERIC (ProQuest), PsycArticle, and Airiti Library (Chinese) by using a combination of multiple key terms: eye-tracking (eye-tracking OR eye-movement OR eye-fixation), diagram (figure* OR illustration* OR graph* OR picture* OR diagram*), and reading (reading OR text* OR multimedia). After duplicates were excluded, 579 English-language articles and 33 Chinese-language articles were identified during the initial search. b. Screening and coding studies using predetermined selection criteria: (a) examined empirically; (b) published in a peer-reviewed SCIE, SSCI, TSSCI, or THCI journal; (c) measured participants’ eye movements and learning outcomes; (d) involved text–diagram reading in the science domain; (e) primarily focused on reading comprehension (studies involving problem-solving or reasoning tasks were excluded); (f) used static visual displays as materials (studies using video, audio, simulation, computer games, and interactive diagrams were excluded). After abstract and full-text screening, 50 English-language articles (including 54 studies) and one Chinese-language article were retained for inclusion in the analysis. c. Analyzing the included studies and interpreting findings using inductive paradigmatic analysis (Polkinghorne, 1995). Based on Guo et al. (2020), categories were not predetermined by the researchers but rather were identified in an inductive manner. After descriptive information was extracted from the included studies and tentatively coded, we compared the similarities and differences of the codes and categorized them into themes to answer the research questions. Finally, the research findings were presented on the basis of these different themes. Of the 55 studies, 32 were conducted with college students. Regarding content area, more than half of the studies involved biology and medicine (n = 34), and mechanics and physics (n = 13) and earth sciences and geography (n = 10) represented the second and third most common content areas. Articles were most commonly sourced from the journals Learning and Instruction (n = 6) and Computers & Education (n = 5). SMI RED 250 (n = 10), EyeLink 1000 (n = 10), and Tobii T120 (n = 9) were the most common models of eye-trackers used. The most commonly used eye movement indicators were total fixation duration (n = 41) and the transition between areas of interest (n = 36). The qualitative synthesis of the studies was organized according to two major themes: cognitive processes and interventions. a. Cognitive processes. (1) Eye movement patterns. The eye movement data support dual-coding theory (Paivio, 1986), which is the theoretical basis of CTML and ITPC and suggests that the human cognitive system is composed of two sets of subsystems: verbal and pictorial. Generally, reading is text-driven rather than diagram-driven, and readers may have different reading patterns that involve varying degrees of diagram processing and text–diagram integration. Those who more often inspect diagrams and refer to text and diagrams during reading usually performed better. (2) Reader characteristics. Higher-level readers were more likely to utilize diagram inspection and text–diagram referencing tactics compared with lower-level readers, and they generally had better learning performance; this applied to students in both academic-oriented schools (compared to non-academic-oriented schools) and high-ability students (compared to low-ability students). People with low prior knowledge (PK) tended to inspect more text than those with high PK, but no consistent pattern was discernible in diagram inspections, text–diagram referencing, and learning performance. In terms of cognitive style, visualizers fixated more on diagrams, and verbalizers fixated more on text, but the findings regarding learning performance were mixed. (3) Material characteristics and their interactions with reader characteristics. High-ability readers put more effort into difficult articles, and low-ability readers put more effort into articles with medium-low difficulty. High-ability and senior-grade readers increased diagram inspection and “diagram–item” references as the difficulty of the task increased. Readers in the second cycle of reading decreased text inspection and increased diagram inspection, reflecting adjustment by the reader. When inconsistent information appeared in material, readers typically performed more inspections, reinspections, and transitions in the beginning, but this did not affect reading performance. b. Interventions. (1) Material manipulation. First, readers tended to fixate on signaled sections (i.e., key points were highlighted via colors, labels, and arrows) faster than on nonsignaled sections, and this effect was greater for readers with low PK. Readers performed better on signaled materials than on nonsignaled materials, but this pattern did not show among younger readers. Second, readers inspected explanatory diagrams more than decorative diagrams; however, the effect on performance by adding different types of diagrams was unclear. Third, readers transitioned more between text and diagrams when the two were physically integrated than when they were separated. The spatial contiguity effect on performance depended on whether the information was necessary. (2) Instructional interventions. Overall, instructional intervention usually affected readers’ eye movement patterns and was likely to enhance learning performance through mediators of visual behavior such as text–diagram references and diagram inspection. Reading ability and domain knowledge may be moderating variables. Our results demonstrated that the inclusion of diagrams in science texts usually affects readers’ visual behavior but does not guarantee positive learning performance. The key to learning improvement is the effective operation of the dual channels of a reader’s cognitive system. Some reader characteristics (such as ability and PK) may play moderating roles in eye movement and learning performance. Several gaps in eye-tracking research on text–diagram science reading were identified in this review. First, more research studies should be conducted with preschool children, K-12 students, and adults. Second, future research studies should include spatial-scale eye movement indicators and distinguish between initial and late processing indicators. Third, other process measures, such as think-aloud protocols, should be included to help interpret eye movement data. Fourth, future research should focus on potential moderators (such as ability, PK, age, and content area) or the factors that contain complex research manipulations and were underrepresented in the studies in our review (such as cognitive style and type of diagram). Additionally, it is recommended that future research further explore readers’ self-regulatory processes by using eyetracking technology. Finally, the findings of this study suggest that instructors should also consider individual differences and modify their instructions to help readers master the skills of reading diagrams and text–diagram references rather than focusing exclusively on the course content. First, the strict screening criteria used in this study may have limited the scope of this review. Second, some empirical studies were based on small samples or a single measurement, which may have limited the findings, and the data pertaining to some themes in the review came from a small number of studies; therefore, special care must be taken when interpreting the results. Third, the empirical research itself may have been somewhat biased when published, which may have inflated the effectiveness of the interventions. Fourth, this review focused on the domain of scientific reading materials, and consequently, the results may not be generalized to other content areas.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2940,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationship between Fast Mapping, Retention, and Expressive Vocabulary in Mandarin-Speaking Toddlers","Pei-Yu Lai, Hui-Mei Liu","lexicon, retention, fast mapping, early vocabulary acquisition, Mandarin-speaking toddlers","Vocabulary development is an ongoing process that begins in early infancy and continues into early adulthood. Moreover, early word-learning abilities are strongly related to later literacy performance. Fast mapping (FM) is a critical word-learning mechanism for early vocabulary growth in 2–3-year-old toddlers. Aside from FM, retention is another crucial ability that enables children to retain and integrate a novel word into their lexicon. In the past, word-learning studies focused on how children learn a noun and were mostly based on English acquisition. According to the literature, word class can influence how children learn a new word; for example, among toddlers, learning the word for a novel action is more difficult than learning the word for an object, implying that learning verbs is harder than learning nouns. Some research has explained that many concrete nouns refer to naturally discrete referents. By contrast, even verbs with fairly concrete meanings (such as motion verbs) are more ambiguous than nouns. Owing to the high-frequency input of verbs and their salient position in a sentence, Mandarin is considered a verb-prominent language. Researchers have also discovered that Mandarin-speaking toddlers have a higher ratio of verbs in their lexicon compared with similarly aged speakers of other languages. In the current study, we investigated (1) the scope and composition of toddlers’ lexicons; (2) the word-learning performance (FM, Retention, and Production) of 25–45-month-old Mandarin-speaking toddlers; (3) how word class affects toddlers’ performance in learning new words; and (4) the relationships between toddlers’ intrinsic word-learning abilities and their extrinsic lexicon. This study recruited 40 developmentally typical Taiwanese toddlers who met the following criteria: (1) first language was Mandarin and (2) were not developmentally delayed or physically or mentally impaired. The average participant age was 37 months (standard deviation [SD] = 5.15). We used a standardized assessment, namely the Mandarin Chinese Communicative Development Inventory, Taiwan version, to assess the word composition and lexicon of individual Mandarin-speaking toddlers participating in the present study. We used a self-designed word-learning task adapted from referent selection design (Horst et al., 2010; Lu & Tsao, 2014), which included three phases, FM, retention, and production. Two versions of the task were designed—noun and verb— to investigate whether nouns are easier to learn than verbs when both word types are presented in comparable sentence contexts, controlling for the number of exposures. Each version of the task included four familiar and four novel words to examine how novelty affects word-learning. The procedure began with the noun condition and after a 10-min break, proceeded to the verb condition. Each condition contained a learning event, FM, production, and retention phase. During the learning event phase, a laptop was employed to present toddlers with the referent picture. Three prerecorded instruction sentences were played; for instance, “zhe shi (this is) ‘referent object’,” “you yi ge (there is one) ‘referent object’,” and “‘referent object’ zai zhe li (is here)!” These three sentences are all examples of common phrases used in daily conversational Mandarin. After three exposures to the word, the study transitioned to the FM phase in which three pictures (including a correct referent object’s picture) were presented on the laptop and the examiner asked the toddler, “In the three pictures, which one is the ‘referent object’?” In the production phase, the referent object´s picture was presented, and the examiner asked, “What is this?” to encourage the toddler to say the novel word without prompting. After a 5-min break, without any recap or practice of the word, the Retention phase began. In this phase, three pictures were presented to the toddler, and the examiner asked, “In the three pictures, which one is the ‘referent object’?” The same procedure was applied when verbs were used, but a 20-s prerecorded referent action film was presented in the learning event phase, and referent action GIFs were presented in the FM, production, and retention phases. The number and sequences of the presented stimulus in the aforementioned phases were well-controlled. Descriptive statistics, including percentages and means, one-way repeated-measure ANOVA, and statistical significance tests were used to analyze the data. In addition, Pearson’s correlation and linear regression were respectively used to examine the relationship and these variables’ predictability of each other. We determined that the average lexicon size for Mandarin-speaking toddlers was 536.67 words [SD = 128.05], and on average, nouns accounted for 50% [SD = .24], verbs and adjectives accounted for 25% [SD = .02], and close words accounted for 9% [SD = .02] of their lexicon. Our results are consistent with the literature showing that Mandarin-speaking toddlers exhibit “noun bias” in their early lexicon (Chen & Liu, 2014). Second, in the word-learning task, we found that Mandarin-speaking toddlers at this stage have well-developed noun and verb FM abilities. Their accuracies for novel word-learning, both nouns and verbs, exceeded 80%. However, they demonstrated little ability in the retention (noun acc = .64, SD = .25; verb acc = .44, SD = .3) and production phases (noun acc = .09, SD = .12; verb acc = .08, SD = .21). These findings indicate that 2–4-year-old Mandarin-speaking toddlers can successfully map a novel word onto a referent object or action but fail at retaining novel words after a 5-min retention phase. Additionally, we determined that the learning performance for verbs in the retention phrase was significantly worse than that for nouns [F(1, 38) = 16.97, p < .001, η2= .31]. These results indicate that FM and retention can be seen as two different mechanisms in word-learning and also suggest that learning a verb or action is more difficult than learning a noun or object, which is consistent with the literature. Finally, there was a medium positive correlation between verb learning and toddlers’ lexicon in both the FM (r = .482– .564, ps < .01) and retention (r = .336– .485, ps < .05) phases, which was not seen during the noun learning task. Moreover, individuals’ verb learning ability was a significant predictor of lexicon size (r2 = .28, p < .001), and lexicon size could also predict verb learning ability (r2 = .28, p < .001). This suggests that toddlers’ verb learning ability and their lexicon have bidirectional predictive power, meaning that toddlers who have larger lexicons demonstrate better verb learning ability and those who have better verb learning ability also tend to learn more new words. Under daily word-learning conditions, verbs usually appear with other words (e.g., known words or pronouns) in a sentence. For instance, when a novel verb appears in a structural argument with other types of words, “syntactic bootstrapping” can facilitate verb learning. In summary, our findings indicate that 2–4-year-old Mandarin-speaking toddlers have well-developed FM ability for both nouns and verbs but only a small proportion can retain the newly-learned words. Retaining and integrating a verb’s (action) representation into the lexicon can be more challenging than doing so with a noun (object). We conclude that in the early vocabulary learning stage, toddlers who can utilize verbs or have a large verb vocabulary at their command are privileged in word-learning and that verb learning ability plays a crucial role in early vocabulary development for Mandarin-speaking toddlers. It would be beneficial to integrate the assessment of novel word-learning processes of individuals with typical and atypical development into the evaluation of early language development and disorders.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2941,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Validation of the Chinese Reading Motivation Scale,"Pin-Lun Juan, Kuo-En Chang, Yao-Ting Sung","expectancy-value theory, reading motivation, reading motivation scale, confirmatory factor analysis","Reading is a complex activity that requires long-term activity. Therefore, if you want to keep reading behavior, you need to have a strong reading motivation. In the past research on reading motivation, it was found that reading motivation was inseparable and positively related to the relationship between reading comprehension and reading achievement. This also showed that reading motivation played a vital role in learning. In addition, students’ reading motivation not only affected students’ academic performance and behavior, but was also related to gender and grade. In the gender of reading motivation, it was found that girls’ reading ability was significantly better than that of boys; in the grade of reading motivation, it was found that children were enthusiastic about reading at the beginning, and were curious and interested in reading. But as children grow older, their reading behavior was guided by the conversion of intrinsic motivation to extrinsic motivation. Especially from the middle school stage, the learning goals began to change. For example, the students read for exams, so reading motivation gradually declines. However, most of the current scales measuring reading motivation use Wigfield and Guthrie’s 11 dimensions of MRQ reading motivation as research tools. This reading motivation scale has been developed for a long time and is widely used, and has been translated into different languages used in countries around the world, such as Europe, America, Asia and other regions. However, the reading motivation scale compiled based on the Chinese reading environment is rare. Therefore, this study will use Wigfield and Guthrie’s (1995) MRQ and Wigfield and Eccles (2000) expected value theory as the literature basis to establish a Chinese reading motivation scale suitable for elementary and middle school students to help teachers understand students’ reading motivation. This research was divided into two parts. Study 1 was based on the reading motivation scale constructed by relevant research institutes as the research basis of the literature. Open-ended questions were used to collect data, analyze and classify by content analysis through qualitative interviews to compile the dimension of a Chinese Reading Motivation Scale (CRMS); in Study 2, the pre-test scale questions were established based on the content analysis method of Study 1, and the data and results obtained, and the pre-test and formal test were carried out. Then verify the reliability and validity of the Chinese Reading Motivation Scale (CRMS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) methods. In addition to confirming the reliability and validity of the questionnaire, it also compared the differences in the performance of reading motivation between gender and grade. Study 1 constructed the interview questions of the “Chinese Reading Motivation Scale” (CRMS) through literature review and semi-structured interviews. A total of 60 students participated in the interview. The grades ranged from elementary school to high school, there were 20 students in each grade, 25 boys and 35 girls. Due to the urban-rural gap, 60 participants were from eight regions. There were New Taipei City, Taipei City, Hsinchu, Changhua, Nantou, Chiayi, Kaohsiung, and Yilan. First of all, we will organize the interview transcript of the interview content, and then analyze the interview transcript by means of content analysis. At the same time, there will be expert consultation when we have different opinions in the data sorting. In the data analysis, according to the qualitative analysis steps of Crabtree and Miller (1999), the spoken data analysis method in the content data analysis method (protocol analysis) is carried out, and the audio recording data is transcribed into interview transcript which is then coded and classified. After data analysis in this study, there are a total of 15 dimensions, which will be classified and named, namely “Curiosity,” “Involvement,” “Society,” “Competition,” “Environment,” “Convenience,” “Habit,” “Recognition,” “Challenge,” “Achievement,” “Compliance,” “Efficacy,” “Interest,” “Acquisition of Knowledge” and “Future Ambition.” The Study 2 is mainly based on the 15 dimensions of the Study 1, and the content of the “Chinese Reading Motivation Scale” (CRMS) is compiled. In addition, there will be two stages in data collection and analysis, including the pre-test and the formal test stage. The reliability and validity are verified through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. In the pre-test stage, the participants were students from the fourth grade of elementary school to the eighth grade of junior high school. A total of 750 questionnaires were answered, including 373 boys, 364 girls, and 13 students who did not fill in their gender. According to exploratory factor analysis, the original 15 dimensions were combined into 10 dimensions. Besides, there were 53 questions were deleted from 105 questions, and 52 questions were retained. Ten dimensions, namely “Engagement,” “Future Ambition,” “Recognition and Compliance,” “Environment,” “Competition,” “Grades,” “Society,” “Self-demand,” “Self-efficacy” and “Curiosity.” All the questions had a load of .5 or more, indicating that the scale was reliable. In the formal test stage, a total of 2,400 questionnaires were sent out, mainly for students from grades 3 to 9 in the northern, central, and southern regions of Taiwan. A total of 2,305 questionnaires were collected and 32 of them were invalid because there were over 5 questions were not completed or filled with the same options through the entire questionnaires. There were a total of 2,273 valid questionnaires, with 1,246 boys and 1,027 girls. Confirmatory factor analysis was adopted as the construct validity. The questionnaire was based on a Likert-scale five-point scale. Participants answered the questionnaire according to their actual reading situation, ranging from 1 to 5 points. The higher the score in each dimension, it showed the participants were paying more attention to reading motivation in this dimension. This study constructed a “Chinese Reading Motivation Scale” with 52 questions in 10 dimensions, and verified that the scale was reliable and valid. In the past studies on reading motivation have mostly used overall reading motivation to analyze gender differences but less explored the gender differences in different reading motivation dimensions. This study particularly examined the performance of boys and girls in reading motivation from different perspectives, and provided further information for the comparison of reading motivation between genders. The results of the study were found that the performance of boys and girls in the dimensions of reading motivation was different. Girls were significantly higher than boys in the three dimensions of “Engagement,” “Environment” and “Grades.” On the contrary, in “Recognition and Compliance” and “Competition,” boys were higher than girls. This showed that teachers could consider gender differences and give different teaching stimulation to effectively enhance students’ reading motivation. In addition, from the perspective of grade differences, if we wanted to develop students’ reading motivation, we could start from the students of lower grades. When the teacher had a good reading teaching plan and student had the stronger motivation, it would be easier to achieve effectiveness; on the contrary, the older the grade, the lower the reading motivation. Furthermore, according to the data of interview, it was found that although the “Environment” and “Self-demand” in the reading motivation dimension had no difference in grades, the students generally believed that the “Environment” was a prerequisite for reading, they started reading only in good reading atmosphere and comfortable environment. Therefore, creating and well-arranged “Environment” of classroom was also an important part of teaching that could improve reading motivation; in addition, students could also fully realize their ability and level of reading. Therefore, teachers were suggested to help students find out a suitable and appropriate way of reading. In summary, the target of this “Chinese Reading Motivation Scale” (CRMS) was mainly elementary and middle school students, and had certain reliability and validity; this scale was suitable for Chinese reading environment in Taiwan and can assess students’ multiple aspects of reading motivation. For researchers who want to engage in reading-related research in the future, this CRMS can be used as a basis. In research limitations, this research considered time and labor costs. Currently, the CRMS is only for students from elementary school to middle school. In the future, it can be expanded to high school students in order to examine the applicability of this scale to students who are in different learning stages and will establish a more comprehensive measurement tool for Chinese Reading Motivation Scale.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2942,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Confirmatory Research on the Chinese Version of the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale for Elementary School Teachers,Chun-Wei Chen,"Chinese version of the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (C-OSTES), teacher self-efficacy, confirmatory factor analysis","The theoretical backgrounds for the development of quantitative scales for measuring teacher self-efficacy include the locus of control theory (Rotter, 1966) and self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1977). Although scales based on the locus of control theory were the first to emerge, these scales are now rarely used. By contrast, the scales developed on the basis of self-efficacy theory, including the teacher efficacy scale (TES; Gibson & Dembo, 1984) and the Ohio State Teacher Efficacy Scale (OSTES; Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001), are commonly used (Chen & Wu, 2011). The short form OSTES comprises 12 items and exhibits excellent reliability and validity for evaluating elementary and middle school teachers. At the elementary and middle school level, increasing student engagement through instructional strategies and classroom management is a key goal for teachers (Chen & Wu, 2011). The research value of using the OSTES to evaluate teacher self-efficacy stems from its relevance to that goal. Related studies have employed the OSTES to measure the self-efficacy of elementary and middle school teachers in the United States (Harper et al., 2018; Woolfolk Hoy et al., 2008), Canada (Ross & Bruce, 2007), the United Kingdom (Woodcock et al., 2019), Scotland (Brady & Woolfson, 2008), Italy (Lent et al., 2011), Iran (Mohamadi & Asadzadeh, 2012; Rastegar & Memarpour, 2009), South Korea (Choi et al., 2019; Klassen et al., 2009), and Singapore (Chong et al., 2010; Klassen et al., 2009; Klassen et al., 2008). By using factor analysis, studies have mostly supported the viewpoint of Tschannen- Moran and Woolfolk Hoy, who have suggested dividing the OSTES into the three factors of instructional strategies, classroom management, and student engagement. Chen and Wu (2011) collaborated on the Chinese translation of the OSTES (C-OSTES) and recruited middle school teachers to be research participants to explore its psychometric properties. Their findings revealed satisfactory fit for the individual items in the C-OSTES. The factor structure of the C-OSTES is identical to that of the original OSTES, and the C-OSTES demonstrated excellent construct validity, discriminant validity, and reliability when used to measure the self-efficacy of middle school teachers. However, Cheung (2008) performed an exploratory factor analysis of the Hong Kong and Shanghai versions of the OSTES and revealed that the scales had a single-factor structure and a two-factor structure, respectively. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated that the OSTES had poor fit in measuring the self-efficacy of teachers in The Republic of Cyprus and South Korea (Klassen et al., 2009). The C-OSTES exhibited adequate validity and reliability for measuring the self-efficacy of Taiwanese middle school teachers (Chen & Wu, 2011). The current study explored the psychometric properties of the C-OSTES for measuring the self-efficacy of Taiwanese elementary school teachers, the appropriateness of each C-OSTES item, and whether the C-OSTES has adequate validity and reliability. A total of 1,021 Taiwanese public elementary school teachers were recruited as research participants for this study. First, item analysis and assessment were performed on each C-OSTES item to determine its fit. CFA, Pearson product-movement correlation analysis, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and internal consistency analysis were subsequently performed to evaluate construct validity, criterion-related validity, discriminant validity, and reliability. In terms of construct validity, the CFA results indicated that the overall model fit, preliminary fit, and fit of the internal structure model of the three-factor correlated factor model were satisfactory, suggesting that the C-OSTES had adequate construct validity. In terms of criterion-related validity, the C-OSTES subscales and the overall scale exhibited positive correlations with three criteria, namely affective organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and organizational citizenship behaviors. This finding indicated that the C-OSTES had adequate criterion-related validity. This study applied the Fornell-Larcker criterion (Fornell & Larcker, 1981) to perform an evaluation of discriminant validity and determined that the C-OSTES exhibited satisfactory discriminant validity. We further employed MANOVA to inspect the differences in C-OSTES scores across elementary school teachers of varying education levels and teaching positions. Our results revealed significant differences in C-OSTES scores across education levels and teaching positions. In particular, teachers with a master’s degree or above scored higher in the instructional strategies and student engagement subscales than did those with a college education level or lower. Teachers holding a concurrent position as supervisor, director, or homeroom teacher scored higher in classroom management than did subject-area teachers. Teachers holding a concurrent position as supervisor or director scored higher in student engagement than did subject-area teachers and teachers holding a concurrent position as homeroom teacher. These results indicated that the C-OSTES exhibited adequate discriminant validity. Finally, in terms of reliability, Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk Hoy (2001) recruited 255 US teachers as participants and performed reliability analysis of the OSTES. Their results revealed that the Cronbach’s α of the instructional strategy, classroom management, and student engagement subscales was .81– .86. Chen and Wu (2011) recruited 747 Taiwanese middle school teachers as research participants and analyzed the reliability of the C-OSTES; they determined that the Cronbach’s α of the three subscales was .86– .93 and that of the overall scale was .92. Our reliability analysis results indicated that the Cronbach’s α of the three subscales was .90– .93 and that of the overall scale was .94. Our obtained reliability coefficient values were higher than those of Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk Hoy as well as Chen and Wu. In summary, the C-OSTES has adequate validity and reliability and is suitable for measuring the self-efficacy of elementary school students. Klassen et al. (2011) reviewed 218 empirical studies on teacher self-efficacy published between 1998 and 2009 and suggested using the OSTES (Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk Hoy, 2001) to measure teacher self-efficacy. As also determined by Chen and Wu (2011), the present study concludes that the C-OSTES has suitable validity and reliability. Accordingly, future relevant studies should be conducted to verify the use of the C-OSTES for measuring self-efficacy in teachers. However, our CFA results on the use of the C-OSTES to evaluate Taiwanese elementary school teachers revealed that the three-factor correlated factor model exhibited favorable fit. This result differs from that of Cheung (2008), who revealed that the Hong Kong and Shanghai versions of the OSTES had a single-factor and two-factor structure, respectively. Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Shanghai use Chinese as their official language. However, Taiwan’s education system and policies are completely different from those of Hong Kong and Shanghai, which have similar education systems and policies but some distinct cultural traits. Future studies should conduct cross-national comparisons to explore the psychometric properties of the C-OSTES for measuring self-efficacy in Hong Kong and Shanghai teachers. These studies should examine whether the validity of the C-OSTES holds under different scenarios, and they should determine whether the validity of the C-OSTES can be generalized. In Taiwan, many tools have been developed to measure teacher (teaching) self-efficacy (Pan, 2005, 2007; Sun, 1995, 2001, 2003, 2005). Future studies should perform measurements and analyses using both the C-OSTES and other teacher (teaching) self-efficacy scales developed in Taiwan to verify their convergent validity. Additionally, studies on the long form OSTES, which comprises 24 items, may include localized items developed to measure teacher self-efficacy. In the process of creating a teacher self-efficacy scale, researchers may develop a new theoretical structure. With respect to the results of the validity analysis, the American Psychological Association (APA), American Educational Research Association (AERA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) jointly published the Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests in 1974. According to these standards, validity was divided into criterion-related validity, content validity, and construct validity (American Psychological Association et al., 1974). In the subsequent three editions, the word “tests” in the title was changed to “testing.” In the 1985 edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing jointly published by the APA, AERA, and NCME, validity was divided into construct-related evidence, content-related evidence, and criterion-related evidence. However, in the 1999 edition, the validity classification system described in the 1985 edition was discontinued; instead, the 1999 edition discussed five types of validity evidence: evidence based on test content, evidence based on response processes, evidence based on internal structure, evidence based on relations to other variables, and evidence based on consequences of testing. The 2014 edition retained the four types of validity evidence and included an additional fifth type, namely evidence for validity and consequences of testing (American Educational Research Association et al., 1985, 1999, 2014). Most Taiwanese empirical studies that have developed, established, and verified scales have referenced the validity classification method proposed in the 1974 edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests when discussing their validity analysis results (Chen et al., 2020; Guo, 2021; Hsieh, 2020; Lee, 2020; Lee & Hong, 2021; Liu & Chen, 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Wang & Lee, 2020; Wu, 2020). However, future empirical studies aiming to develop, establish, and verify scales relevant to the field should reference the five types of validity evidence proposed in the 2014 edition of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (jointly published by the APA, AERA, and NCME) to explain their validity analysis results.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2943,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Master’s Study Duration: The Effects of Active Learning Based on the Belief-Action-Outcome Model,"Jon-Chao Hong, Jian-Hong Ye, Yu-Feng Wu, Zhen He","academic self-efficacy, academic self-confidence, active learning strategies, belief-action-outcome model, study duration","Influenced by Confucianism, the social role is postponed from school to work in Taiwan, most young adults enter the job market after completing a higher education degree. However, in recent years, delayed graduation by postgraduate students has become a problem. To understand this phenomenon, this study recruited a mix of participants who had already graduated and participants who were about to graduate (individuals who had completed their courses and thesis). The aim of the study was to explore (1) how individuals’ academic self-efficacy affects their active learning strategies and academic self-confidence and (2) how this is reflected in the duration of their studies. A total of 245 valid questionnaires were collected, comprising the responses of 91 men and 154 women. Among the participants, 34.3% graduated on time, whereas 51% did not graduate on time because of incomplete theses. A confirmatory factor analysis approach was adopted in this study. The results demonstrated that academic self-efficacy was positively related to active learning strategies (higher-order, integrative, and reflective strategies) and active learning strategies were positively related to academic self-confidence, whereas academic self-confidence was negatively related to an extended duration for completing a master’s degree.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2944,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Interaction between Exercising Self-Control and Trait Self-Control on Convergent and Divergent Thinking,Fa-Chung Chiu,"trait self-control (TSC), exercising self-control, convergent thinking, divergent thinking","Researchers have investigated the influence of exercising self-control on an individual’s convergent and divergent thinking, discovering that participants demonstrate poor convergent thinking after exercising self-control (Baumeister et al., 1998; Schmeichel et al., 2003). However, Chiu (2014) and Chiu et al. (2017) observed that after exercising self-control, participants demonstrated improved divergent thinking, indicating that exercising self-control resulted in contrasting effects on convergent and divergent thinking. Although studies have indicated that exercising self-control reduced convergent thinking performance, they have also found that exercising self-control enhanced divergent thinking performance. However, the effects of the interaction between exercising self-control (e.g., active self-control) and trait self-control (TSC) and convergent–divergent thinking have yet to be investigated. In one study, convergent and divergent thinking performance were negatively correlated (r = -.54; Chiu, 2010), and hence, we would expect different moderating effects on convergent and divergent thinking when participants with high or low TSC exercise self-control. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of the interaction between exercising self-control and TSC on convergent and divergent thinking. TSC can be defined as general and cross-domain self-control capacity (Imhoff et al., 2014), which includes the regulation of thoughts, emotions, impulses, and performance (Baumeister et al., 1994). TSC is a personality trait, thus distinguishing it from the state of exercising self-control. In researching how the interaction between TSC and the state of self-control (i.e., exercising self-control) influence subsequent thinking performance, some researchers have proposed that high-TSC participants should be less vulnerable to self-control depletion because they have relatively more mental resources to draw from and can avoid reaching the point of depletion (e.g., Dvorak & Simons, 2009). Imhoff et al. (2014), however, suggested that in contrast to low-TSC participants, high-TSC participants consumed more candies after manipulations were applied to deplete their self-control. DeWall et al. (2007), by contrast, determined that compared with low-TSC participants, high-TSC participants rarely inhibit their impulses actively and therefore less frequently engage in the effortful inhibition of impulses. The active suppression of desires in everyday life enables individuals to develop increased resistance to temptations (Baumeister et al., 1998; Gailliot et al., 2007), but high-TSC individuals typically avoid tempting situations in everyday life, and consequently, actively resisting temptation becomes increasingly difficult for them. When forced to exercise self-control against temptations, high-TSC individuals tend to show a comparatively weak ability. The preceding discussion demonstrates that it is necessary to clarify how exercising self-control interacts with TSC and then affects convergent and divergent thinking. Therefore, this study investigated the influences of the interaction of exercising self-control and TSC on convergent and divergent thinking. In Study 1, 92 participants were randomly assigned to either the exercising self-control condition or the control condition. Under the exercising self-control condition, participants were prohibited from using Chinese characters containing the radicals “ イ” or “ 口” while writing. Next, they were asked to complete a critical thinking test (i.e., to test convergent thinking). The results showed that exercising self-control did not reduce convergent thinking, and participants with low TSC demonstrated higher performance in critical thinking under the exercising self-control condition than did participants with high TSC. However, under the control condition, both low- and high-TSC participants exhibited similar levels of critical thinking. Study 2 enrolled 77 participants. Except for the dependent variable, which was changed to divergent thinking, the procedures of Study 2 were identical to those of Study 1. The results indicated that participants with high TSC demonstrated superior originality under the exercising self-control condition to the participants with low TSC. However, under the control condition, both the low- and high-TSC participants exhibited similar levels of originality. These findings suggest that TSC moderates the effects of exercising self-control on convergent and divergent thinking. Participants with low TSC significantly improved their performance in convergent thinking after exercising self-control. However, participants with high TSC performed significantly better than did those with low TSC in terms of the originality of divergent thinking after exercising self-control. In regard to the moderating effect of TSC on the association between exercising self-control and convergent thinking, we found that participants with low TSC improved their convergent thinking performance after exercising self-control. This finding accords with the negative effect found by Imhoff et al. (2014) rather than the proposition that high TSC would have a positive effect in the exercising self-control condition. In terms of the positive effects of high TSC, we proposed that the convergent thinking of participants with high TSC would not be affected by TSC after exercising self-control and that due to the negative effect of high TSC (Imhoff et al., 2014), the participants with high TSC would exhibit significantly lower performance on convergent thinking after exercising self-control. However, in this study, the participants with low TSC exhibited a significant increase in convergent thinking performance after exercising self-control. Additionally, the participants with high TSC demonstrated lower performance in convergent thinking after exercising self-control compared with the control group. Thus, under the exercising self-control condition, the results tended to support the negative effect of high TSC on convergent thinking. Exercising self-control had a significant effect on the participants’ performance in fluency, flexibility, and originality; however, the interaction between exercising self-control and TSC was found to only influence originality. In addition, it was mainly the participants with high TSC who exhibited increased originality after exercising self-control, whereas participants with low TSC were not affected. Moreover, the interaction between exercising self-control and TSC did not affect the number of ideas produced or the variability of ideas produced. However, it did influence the novelty of ideas and encouraged more distant associations (Mednick, 1962). This might be because participants with TSC had reduced self-control inhibition after exercising self-control (Schmeichel et al., 2010), making them more receptive to novel and more distant ideas, thereby increasing only originality but not fluency (more ideas) or variability (more types of ideas). This accords with previous research indicating that participants with higher inhibition demonstrated lower creativity (Carson et al., 2003). In summary, under the exercising self-control condition, the negative effect of TSC on convergent thinking was clearly supported; therefore, this study’s findings are consistent with those of Imhoff et al. (2014). However, the positive effect of TSC (DeWall et al., 2007; Gailliot et al., 2006) was not supported. Notably, the results of this study indicated that while both the participants with high and low TSC exercised self-control, those with high TSC demonstrated increased originality but decreased convergent thinking. These results indicated that whether exercising self-control affects convergent or divergent thinking depends on the level of TSC; moreover, compared with people with low TSC, people with high TSC exhibited lower convergent thinking and higher divergent thinking after exercising self-control. Hence, high TSC was associated with a negative effect on convergent thinking and a positive effect on the originality of divergent thinking after exercising self-control.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2945,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Verification and Analysis of the Test Enjoyment Process Model of Junior High School Students,Yen-Ying Lin,"test enjoyment, control-value theory, cognitive-motivational model","Studies have verified that academic emotions are discrete and highly related to learning motivation and achievement performance (Pekrun, 2008; Pekrun et al., 2002b). However, most investigations into academic emotions have focused on negative emotions, such as test anxiety, with fewer exploring positive emotions, such as enjoyment, pride, and hope (Pekrun et al., 2002a). Many studies in positive psychology have reported that positive emotions play a key role in human development (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Nevertheless, research focusing on positive academic emotions remains rare. As Pekrun et al. (2002a) stated, learner with positive emotions can foresee goals and challenges, increase resilience to protect physical and mental health, increase a sense of attachment to important others. Therefore, positive academic emotions merit investigation. With reference to different learning situations, academic emotions can be divided into those that are class-related, learning-related, and test-related (Pekrun et al., 2002b). Test-related emotion, for example, refers to various subjective emotions related to exam taking (Pekrun et al., 2004). Because exams are events that can be anticipated and recalled, test emotions can be further divided into pretest and posttest emotions in relation to the examination process (Schutz & Decuir, 2002). Most research on test emotions has centered on test anxiety, with fewer studies examining positive test emotions. According to Pekrun et al. (2002a), enjoyment is always accompanied by adaptive learning behaviors, such as the use of in-depth learning strategies, steady and continual effort, and high-level self-regulation, which can promote learning effectiveness. This means that enjoyment is a basic and crucial positive emotion that can play a major role in students’ learning engagement in the classroom. In the theoretical construction of academic emotions, control-value theory (Pekrun, 2000; Pekrun et al., 2002b) explains the antecedent variables of academic emotions. Control-value theory holds that cognitive appraisals related to control and value are the main variables affecting academic emotions. Control-related cognitive appraisals refer to the influence of an individual’s personal perception on their actions and results and include action-control, action-outcome, and situation-outcome expectancy (Pekrun, 2005). This study applied self-efficacy and effort belief as control-related cognitive appraisal variables to predict the emotions experienced by students in test situations. Value-related cognitive appraisals refer to the degree to which learners subjectively value their actions and results (Pekrun et al., 2010) and include intrinsic and extrinsic values. In this study, we selected goal orientation as the value-related cognitive appraisal variable. The cognitive-motivation model can be applied to explain the consequence variables of academic emotions. Pekrun et al. (2002b) advocated that learners’ academic emotions affect their learning performance through motivation, strategies for learning, cognitive resources, and self-regulation. In this study, we selected motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies as cognitive-motivation variables to understand how test emotions affect academic achievement through motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies. Grounded in control-value theory and the cognitive-motivation model of academic emotions, this research explored test enjoyment. We collected information about enjoyment before and after a test and then examined the related antecedents and consequences to elucidate the effects of test enjoyment on students’ learning strategies and achievements during the test process. Accordingly, the objectives of the study were (1) to construct and verify the test enjoyment process model and (2) to analyze the following predictive effects: (a) control-value appraisals in relation to pretest enjoyment and motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies (b) and pretest enjoyment and motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies in relation to perceived test satisfaction, posttest enjoyment, and test scores. Data collected from seventh-to-ninth-grade junior high school students (N = 1321; 668 boys) from 12 schools (51 classes) in Taiwan were examined. Data collection was conducted in two waves. The first wave was conducted 1 week before the second sectional test. Scales measuring self-efficacy, effort belief, goal orientation, and pretest enjoyment were applied in that order. The second wave was conducted within 1 week after the second sectional test. Scales measuring motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies, test perception satisfaction, and posttest enjoyment were employed in that order. All scales referred to the students’ mathematics classes, and participants were requested to input their second sectional mathematics test scores on the scales. This study applied structural equation modeling to analyze the data using LISREL8.80. To assess the model fit, we used well-established indices, namely root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; < .08), goodness of fit index (GFI), normed fit index (NFI), nonnormed fit index (NNFI), comparative fit index (CFI), and incremental fit index (IFI; > .90) in addition to chi-square test statistics. The results revealed that the test enjoyment process model was supported by the observed data; χ2(184, N = 1321) = 1979.17, p < .05; RMSEA = .086, GFI = .88, NNFI = .92, NFI, CFI, and IFI all equal .94. This results show that in addition to test anxiety, junior high school students also experience positive emotions, such as enjoyment, during math exams, and with the different test time points, there are different predictive relationships between test enjoyment and its antecedent and consequential variables. In other words, the results of this study support the important claim that ""the academic emotional process composed of control-value theory and cognitive-motivation model is a cyclic process"" (Pekrun, 2000; Pekrun et al., 2002b). In terms of the direct predictive effect of latent independent variables, self-efficacy (γ11 = .37), effort belief (γ12 = .06), approach mastery goal (γ13 = .35), avoidance mastery goal (γ14 = -.14), and approach performance goal (γ15 = .08) predicted pretest enjoyment. Furthermore, self-efficacy (γ21 = .09), effort belief (γ22 = .18), approach mastery goal (γ23 = .12), avoidance mastery goal (γ24 = .19), and approach performance goal (γ25 = .14) positively predicted motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies. No direct effect was observed for avoidance performance goal. In terms of the direct predictive effect of latent dependent variables, pretest enjoyment positively predicted motivational/ emotional regulated strategies (β21 = .12), perceived test satisfaction (β31 = .23), and posttest enjoyment (β41 = .15); motivational/ emotional self-regulated strategies positively predicted posttest enjoyment (β42 = .07) and test scores (β52 = .11); perceived test satisfaction positively predicted posttest enjoyment (β54 = .74); and, finally, posttest enjoyment positively predicted test score (β65 = .45). Regarding the indirect predictive effects of latent independent variables on latent dependent variables, first, self-efficacy, effort belief, approach mastery goal, avoidance mastery goal, and approach performance goal had an indirect effect on motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies through pretest enjoyment. Second, self-efficacy, effort belief, approach mastery goal, avoidance mastery goal, and approach performance goal had an indirect effect on perceived test satisfaction through pretest enjoyment. Third, self-efficacy, effort belief, approach mastery goal, avoidance mastery goal, and approach performance goal had an indirect effect on posttest enjoyment through pretest enjoyment, motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies, and perceived test satisfaction. Finally, self-efficacy, effort belief, approach mastery goal, avoidance mastery goal, and approach performance goal had an indirect effect on test scores through pretest enjoyment, motivational/emotional self-regulated strategies, perceived test satisfaction, and posttest enjoyment. These results support control-value theory and the cognitive-motivation model of academic emotions, indicating that cognitive appraisal variables can predict test emotions, and test emotions can predict test scores through cognitive-motivational variables. On the basis of the study findings, suggestions are made for future research and practical applications of teaching.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2946,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Processing Strategies for Reading Illustrated Scientific Texts and Chinese Academic Words with Different Degrees of Semantic Transparency among Middle-School Students: An Eye-Tracking Study,"Pin-Hsien Kuo, Yu-Cin Jian",,"Scientific texts are texts with multiple representations (texts and diagrams) containing specific narrative styles, signal representations in pictures, and difficult academic words. Students may struggle with scientific texts—whether through having weak reading ability, over-focusing on text, or ignoring scientific pictures—as well as with graphic comparison and integration strategies. Therefore, students often face difficulties in understanding scientific texts. In particular, academic words are translated using different translation methods (such as paraphrasing and transliteration), and the understanding of academic words may be affected by semantic transparency. The application of eye-tracking technology is suitable for exploring how middle-school students read such content. Few eye movement studies have focused on academic words, with most exploring the cognitive process of adult readers recognizing academic words when reading plain text. Therefore, understanding how middle-school students read scientific texts containing academic words is a crucial topic. This study used eye tracking to explore the cognitive processes and strategies of seventh-grade students with different reading abilities as they read illustrated scientific texts as well as to examine how readers cope with academic words with high (paraphrase) and low (transliteration) semantic transparency. The three specific research questions were as follows: a. When seventh-grade students with different reading abilities read scientific texts with different levels of semantic transparency (paraphrased or transliterated text), is any difference observable in memory and comprehension performance? (Assessed through free recall and reading comprehension tests). b. How do seventh-grade students with different reading abilities recognize academic words with different levels of semantic transparency (paraphrased or transliterated words)? What information can be used to assist their understanding? (Based on academic words as the unit of analysis and analyzing eye movement patterns). c. On the basis of the analysis of eye movement patterns and cued retrospective think-aloud (CRTA), what strategies do seventh-grade students with different reading abilities adopt when reading illustrated scientific texts? Participants. Seventh-grade students (N = 65) were divided into groups based on their reading ability through a pretest. The high, middle, and low reading ability groups comprised 23, 22, and 20 students, respectively. The average age was 13.12 years (SD = 0.27), and all study participants were native Chinese speakers with normal or corrected vision. Materials. We designed four illustrated scientific texts by manipulating academic words (paraphrase and transliteration). Each text was presented on a single page, with the text placed on the left and two colorful pictures on the right. The number of texts related to physics, chemistry, and biology themes, and the number of characters and words in each text were evenly matched. Academic words were all low-frequency, and word length was consistent. Three types of diagrams were used, namely organizational and interpretational diagrams and tables. The paragraphs and illustrations of the four texts all had causal contexts. Texts on wireless charging and blood type had high causal connections, whereas texts on radar and penicillin had moderate causal connections. In terms of reading order, accounting for the order of experimental processing, a counterbalance design was implemented. Apparatus. We used the EyeLink Portable Duo (SR Research Ltd., Ottawa, Canada) eye tracker with a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. A fixed chin rest was employed to minimize head movement and perform eye movement correction. If the average error of the gaze position was less than 0.5°, the angle of view did not require correction. Procedure. The research procedure was divided into two stages, namely the pretest and eye movement experiments. The pretest consisted of an academic word familiarity questionnaire and standardized test of reading ability. In the eye movement experiment, relevant guidelines were first displayed on the screen to remind participants of the experimental procedure and precautions, and then the participants were requested to read the practice text to familiarize themselves with the experimental procedure. A 3-min reading time was set for each official text. After the participants had read the text, the text test was complete. After the experiment, the examiner asked the participants to perform free recall and played the participants’ own eye-tracking video to prompt CRTA. Overall strategy use during reading was analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and use of substrategies was analyzed using two-way ANOVA. Reading ability was the between-subjects variable, and word type (paraphrase or transliteration), diagram type (organizational diagram, interpretational diagram, or table), or text theme (four texts) were the within-subjects variables. The dependent variable was the performance of reading the texts or multiple eye movement indicators. The CRTA interview data were used to examine the connection between the three reading ability levels and usage of 17 substrategies, thus revealing whether seventh-grade students with different reading abilities apply different reading strategies to read illustrated scientific texts. The following are the explanations of the research results from post-test performance, eye movement indicators, and CRTA interview data: a. Reading comprehension and free recall: The students with high reading ability outperformed students with middle and low reading abilities in reading comprehension and free recall. The students’ free recall score for the paraphrased version was significantly higher than that for the transliterated version. b. Eye movement (academic words): The students adjusted their reading strategies according to the semantic transparency of academic words. The gaze duration for transliterated academic words was significantly higher than that for paraphrased academic words, indicating that transliterated academic words require longer to decode. The students relied on text messages for scientific reading, and the number of references to sentences in texts was significantly higher than that to scientific diagrams. c. Eye movement (illustrated scientific texts): The high-ability group decoded words more rapidly than the middle-ability and low-ability groups. The mean fixation duration of the high-ability group was significantly shorter than that of the low-ability group. Furthermore, the students realized the critical role of the table, because the revisited fixation duration, total fixation duration, and proportion of fixation duration for the table were significantly longer than those for the other types of diagrams. Students with different reading abilities exhibited differences in processing various types of diagrams. The high-ability group devoted more time to analyzing and reanalyzing the diagrams and recognized the causal context with a high correlation between the two diagrams in the wireless charging text and blood type text. The middle-ability group recognized the correlation between the diagrams and texts, and therefore, for the wireless charging and blood type texts (high diagram–text association), the number of saccades between text and diagrams were both relatively high. The proportion of fixation duration for reading pictures in the low-ability group was significantly lower than that in the middle-ability and high-ability groups, and the low-ability students were unable to distinguish the correlation between the two diagrams. d. In terms of the three reading levels, the high-ability group used the overall strategy significantly more than the low-ability group. For the 17 substrategies, the high-ability group exhibited the highest usage of illustrated information and integrated graphic information; the low-ability group exhibited the most frequent usage of key cognitive errors and unclear reading goals. Studies of eye movement during reading with CRTA have been mostly conducted on adult research participants (Trevors, 2016; van Gog et al., 2005), with a distinct lack of research on young readers. This study may be the first to focus on analyzing the reading of illustrated scientific texts by middle-school students using this approach. In this study, obtaining the subjective interpretation data of the eye movement pattern of the reader, rather than indirectly inferring the reader’s reading process through eye movement data, assisted in deepening our understanding of the reading process. In terms of the interpretation of academic words, the results revealed that middle-school students, similar to adult readers, devote more time to decoding academic words in the initial processing stage of reading (Jian & Ko, 2014). This study also supports the theoretical views of cognitive theory of multimedia learning (CTML) (Mayer, 2005) and ITPC (Schnotz & Bannert, 2003). Representations of text and diagrams link and organize the meaning of the messages through dual-code representation, integrating the presented information with an individual’s prior knowledge. This is an essential step in the process for achieving the comprehension of diagrams and texts. The CRTA data revealed that high-ability students often use inference and integrated reading strategies (such as the use of illustrated information, integrated texts, and diagrams) to correctly identify the type of picture and amount of information and adjust their reading strategy accordingly. The middle-ability students often used information extraction strategies (such as finding key points and rereading), whereas the low-ability students often used negative reading processing methods (such as misunderstanding key points and unclear reading purposes); the low-ability students’ methods increased the difficultly of learning and understanding effectively when reading popular scientific texts. In this study, we selected academic words for paraphrasing and transliteration. Future studies could conduct in-depth research on semantic transparency, such as designing academic words with high (paraphrase), medium (phonetic-meaning translation), and low (transliteration) semantic transparency to further compare the process of Chinese academic word recognition. Moreover, the amount of information in the illustrations of the experimental materials of this study was not controlled. In the future, expert validity evaluation, among others approaches, can be applied to evaluate and design the manipulation of the information content of the illustrations.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2947,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Prediction of Working Memory and Epistemological Belief in Critical Thinking Skills,Chong-Shainn Hsu,"critical thinking skills, epistemological belief, short-term memory, working memory","Critical thinking (CT) is one of the components contributing to good thinking (Norris & Ennis, 1989), It is also necessary ability for the citizens in democratic society. Especially in the age of the Internet, the variety and complexity of information are greater than in the past. CT is saliently significant. The perfect performance of CT was dependent on domain-general and domain-specific knowledge, CT skills and CT dispositions. Undergraduates reported to have great CT dispositions but performed medium degree of CT skills (Din, 2020). Therefore, it is important to design programs to advance students’ CT skills under the considerations of the factors affecting CT skills performance. CT skills include evaluation of arguments, inference, interpretation, recognition of assumptions, and deduction. These cognitive operations are conducted in working memory (WM) (Halpern, 1998). Epistemological beliefs could affect CT performance (Schraw, 2001). We examined the prediction of WM and epistemological beliefs in CT skills. WM was involved in the processing and storing of information. A few researches showed that WM predicted the performance of reasoning tasks (Barrouillet & Lecas, 1999; Chuderski & Necka, 2012; Copeland & Radvansky, 2004). Baddeley and Hitch (1974) argued that WM had three components: A phonological loop, a visuospatial sketchpad, and the central executive. Individuals kept the speech or written information in the phonological loop. The central executive was responsible for attention control and thus helped the information related to the task keep accessible. We hypothesized that WM predicted the performance of CT skills. Short-term memory (STM) was different from WM, and was only involved in the processing of information. It was also hypothesized that STM predicted CT skills. Processing speed could affect reasoning performance and thus was used as a control variable in this study. We want to learn the net prediction of WM in CT skill performance after controlling the effect of processing speed. Epistemological beliefs referred to what individuals thought of the nature of knowledge and knowing. The number of the dimensions of epistemological beliefs were dependent on how and what researchers conceptualized them as. In this study, the epistemological beliefs scale consisted of five subscales: certainty of knowledge, simplicity of knowledge, source of knowledge (authority), quick learning, and innate ability. Individuals with naïve epistemological beliefs thought that knowledge was fixed, the aggregation of many facts, and conveyed from the authority, and that learning was a simple and linear process. Those with sophisticated epistemological beliefs considered the reliability and validity of information and arguments. It was hypothesized that the more sophisticated epistemological beliefs, the greater CT skills. We speculated that individuals with more sophisticated beliefs and less WM span might be willing to give careful consideration to the questions or information in order to make up for the less WM span. It was hypothesized that WM interacted with epistemological beliefs. We recruited participants from three universities in Tainan City, Taiwan. The three universities were representative of the undergraduates with different academic achievement respectively. Data were collected from 161 undergraduates (51 males and 110 females) but one participant was not analyzed because of not completing the epistemological beliefs scale. The average age was 20.87 (SD = 1.53). Participants were tested individually in a 60-minute session and fulfilled a demographic survey, the adapted Personal Epistemological Beliefs Scale, WM span scale, processing speed scale, Frontal Assessment Battery (Taiwan ed.), and Watson- Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA) (Chinese ed.) in order. WM Index and Processing Speed Index of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS) (Chinese ed.) were used. Frontal Assessment Battery was used to measure the executive function. The Chinese edition of WGCTA had five subtests: inference, recognition of assumptions, deduction, interpretation, and evaluation of arguments. The higher scores in the adapted Personal Epistemological Beliefs Scale, the more naïve. The high scores in other measures implied better cognitive performance. WGCTA and WAIS did not provide percentile ranks for every subtest. The original score was used to indicate participants’ performance of every subtask. CT skills were correlated with WM index, processing speed, and executive function (rs[158] = .40, .25, .28, p < .001), but not correlated with epistemological beliefs. The WM Index of WAIS was constructed by four measures, one involving in the storing of information (STM) and the others involving in the processing and storing. It was found that CT skills was correlated with STM (r = .37, p < .001) and also correlated with the other WM measures (rs = .36, .32, .28, p < .001). The correlation among the five CT subskills and other cognitive ability measures was computed. It was found that deduction was correlated with STM, WM index, processing speed, and executive function (rs = .31, .30, .23, .21, p < .01). Interpretation was correlated with STM, WM index, processing speed, and executive function (rs = .34, .39, .18, .20, p < .05). Deduction was correlated with the whole epistemological belief (r = -.22, p < .01) and also correlated with three components (certainty, simplicity, and authority) (rs= -.29, -.25, -.22, p < .01). Other CT subskills were not correlated with the whole epistemological belief but correlated with a few components of epistemological belief. To our surprise, the innate ability subscale was positively correlated with the whole CT skills performance (r = .18, p < .05) and also with the subtests of inference, recognition of assumptions, and interpretation (rs= .16, .23, .17, p < .05). Regression analysis showed that after processing speed controlled, WM and executive function predicted participants’ CT skill performance (b = .33, .58, p < .05), but the whole epistemological belief did not. Concerning every CT subskill, participants with greater WM performed better interpretation and deduction (b = 0.001, .003, p < .01). A regression analysis was conducted to examine the prediction of the four memory measures, processing speed, and executive function in CT skill performance. STM and executive function were predictive of CT skill performance (b = 73.83, .70, p < .01) but not all measures involving in the storing and processing of information were significant. While every CT subskill was used as dependent variable, the similar outcomes were only observed in the regression on deduction and interpretation. Another regression analysis was conducted to examine the prediction of the five components of the epistemological belief. It was found that simplicity belief predicted CT skills (b = -22.39, p < .01) as we hypothesized. It was surprised that innate ability belief had positive prediction (b = 17.24, p < .05). However, all of the participants performed sophisticated belief on the knowledge simplicity subscale (below 2.5 points), and thus what we found in the above description was that the strength of sophisticated belief in knowledge simplicity was predictive of CT skills. Not all participants showed sophisticated belief on the innate ability subscale (132 ones below 2.5 and 28 ones above 2.5) and there was no significant difference in CT skills between these two groups of the innate ability belief. We tested the interaction of WM subtests and sophisticated belief in knowledge simplicity. No significant interaction was found. The findings showed that the CT skill performance was predicted by STM as well as by WM defined by Baddeley and Hitch (1974). However not all measures of the processing and storing of information were significant. It might be due to the multicollinearity among the three measures. On the other hand, it was implied that STM might be more important than WM for conducting CT skills. Sophisticated beliefs in simplicity knowledge were significant but other factors of epistemological beliefs were not. This finding explained why the whole epistemological belief did not predict CT skills performance. The interaction between working memory and epistemological beliefs was not significant. Based on our findings, it was suggested that the programs for promoting CT skills performance had to take WM and the simplicity belief of knowledge into consideration. Further study were suggested.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2948,53.4,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effect of Reiki and Music on the Negative Mood Regulation Expectancies and Burnout of the Helpers,"Ting-Yu Liu, Yih-Lan Liu","burnout, distance reiki, negative mood regulation expectancies, the helpers","Burnout is a universal social phenomenon and has been paid attention to by researchers, office workers, and the general public. Its influence is far-reaching and extensive. A survey shows that up to 90% of office workers have experienced burnout in Taiwan, and the helpers are one of the high-risk groups. Research in burnout has developed from exploring the causes of burnout to individuals´ coping strategies. When individuals can cope with stress, burnout will be reduced. Although the research of burnout has been widely discussed abroad, there are only a few studies of intervention strategies. One of the critical symptoms of burnout is emotional exhaustion. Previous studies found that negative mood regulation expectancies can predict individuals´ experience of burnout due to work stress and maladaptation. The theory of resource conservation suggests that when individuals lost resources at work and out of balance, the stress will cause burnout. Negative mood regulation expectancies are one kind of resource that has a connection with burnout. However, studies concerning the relationship between burnout and negative mood regulation expectancies are few, and therefore this relationship cannot be confirmed.With the improvement of the social economy, individuals were willing to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Reiki is one kind of the CAM that belongs to the biofield therapies in energy healing therapies, which can affect the surrounding body energy field. Reiki charges, adjusts, and rebalances the body energy field to create the best state for the body´s natural healing system. Previous studies found that Reiki decreases depression and anxiety, reduces burnout, and improves the quality of cancer patients´ lives. Although the efficacy of Reiki has been widely discussed abroad, there are only a few studies in Taiwan, not even mentioning distance Reiki, which is another form of Reiki. To reduce the counter-transference of touching from Reiki, distance Reiki is a better choice. On the other hand, negative mood regulation expectancies are one of the factors that predict the incidence of burnout. This study aimed to investigate the effects of distance Reiki on the burnout and negative mood regulation expectancies of the helpers.This study recruited 30 helping workers at university in the northern cities between 2018 and 2019 and conducted distance Reiki and musical interventions by adopting a single-blind, randomized experimental design. Participants were divided into experimental groups and control groups. The experimental group accepted distance Reiki and musical interventions, and the control group accepted musical interventions. Participants accepted thirty minutes intervention each time, once a week, over eight weeks. Before and after the intervention, participants filled in the NMRS (Negative Mood Regulation Scale) and MBI scale (Maslach Burnout Inventory. Only twenty-four participants´ data (12 in each intervention group) were included in the analysis. The MBI scale was developed to assess burnout and includes three dimensions: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. The high scores indicate a more severe burnout. NMRS was a commonly used scale to measure individual beliefs regarding what they can do to make themselves feel better when they are in a bad mood. IT includes two different dimensions: emotional response adjustment and cognitive-behavioral adjustment.Before conducting interventions, the Researcher explained the research purpose, conditions, intervention process, intervention strategies, potential risks, privacy, and right of participants. Participants´ informed consent forms were obtained after confirming that they understood all of the content. All of the research data were processed to ensure the privacy of the participants. The intervention procedure was as follows: (1) measured one-minute average decibels with the noise APP to confirm the environment was suitable for the research before the intervention; (2) confirmed that participants did not have physical discomfort before filled the scale; (3) after filling out the scales, guide them to lie down on the floor with a soft mattress; (4) played music and guided relaxing steps, then research stayed away three meters and behind the participants to make sure participants cannot see research; (5) after finishing the intervention, waked up participants gently with sound; and filled out the scale again. After the participants had finished the interventions, researchers emailed and informed participants in which intervention group they were.The main findings of the study were as follows: (1) after receiving distance Reiki and musical intervention, the experimental group displayed significant differences between pre-test and post-test in helpers´ burnout and its sub-dimensions, but the control group did not show these significance; (2) after receiving distance Reiki and musical intervention, the experimental group showed significant differences between pre-test and post-test in helpers´ negative mood expectancies and its sub-dimensions, but the control group did not show these significance; (3) the experimental group was better than the control group in reducing burnout and its subdimensions scores weekly and achieved significant differences between pre-and post-tests, but this significance of pre- and post-tests did not appear in its´ sub-dimensions; (4) the experimental group´ was better than the control group in improving negative mood regulation expectancies and achieved significant differences between pre-and post-tests, but the improving effect did not appear in overall negative mood regulation expectancies; (5) the experimental group was better than the control group in improving negative mood regulation expectancies and its sub-dimensions weekly. The conclusions of this study are that distance Reiki could improve individuals´ confidence to adjust to negative emotions, and distance Reiki is also one of the effective strategies to reduce helpers´ burnout risk. This study is the first article about distance Reiki intervention in Taiwan and designs standardized processes to improve the research quality. Based on the findings of this study, we provide the application value of distance Reiki and propose suggestions for future research. The research limitations and suggestions of the study are as follows: (1) more than half of the participants have master´s and doctor´s degrees, and their education level is higher than the general public. Then, the results cannot be generalized to other helpers; (2) as the participants agreed to participate in the study, they accepted pretest and were immediately and randomly assigned to the experimental group or the control group. Therefore, some participants were receiving the intervention while the recruiting was ongoing. It was difficult to match the basic characteristics of the participants between the experimental group and the control group; (3) the experimental group accepted distance Reiki and musical interventions, and the improving effect of burnout and negative mood regulation expectancies cannot be inferred to the group when accepting distance Reiki only. It is recommended to include a distance group as a control group in the future; (4) if readers are interested in taking Reiki intervention or participate in Reiki workshop, they need to be familiar with this procedure addressed in the current study. Moreover, they need to be aware that the capability to channel Reiki has to be enlightened through Reiki attunement by Reiki Master; (5) Reiki workshop provides Reiki implementation steps, Reiki attunement, related precautions, and course manuals. However, these workshops are not free for participation; (6) the study showed that distance Reiki reduces burnout and improves negative mood regulation expectancies. Helpers can use distance Reiki at work, such as sending Reiki to depressed or anxious students or cases to improve their physical health and emotion; (7) it is suggested that research should be encouraged to cooperate with Reiki-related organizations, such as Taiwan Reiki Culture Association and Taiwan Reiki Promotion Association, to promote scientific research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2934,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Effects of Perceived Autonomy Support, Self-Efficacy, and Task Value on the Learning Engagement of Junior High School Students","Ying-Chuan Lai, Po-Han Wu","task value, self-efficacy, teachers’ autonomy support, learning engagement","Learning engagement is highly valued by Chang (2012). According to some scholars, only by engaging in learning activities, students can promote their learning and development; as such, learning engagement plays an essential role in the learning process. Learning engagement is a key factor for successful learning and highly related to students’ academic performance.Despite the high value placed on learning engagement, no empirical research has clarified the factors that influence students’ learning engagement, the effects of learning environment and teachers’ autonomy support on learning engagement, or the mechanism through which an individual’s self-efficacy and task value are influenced by teachers’ autonomy support. Evidently, further investigation is required.This study investigated whether the effects of teachers’ autonomy support on learning engagement were moderated by students’ self-efficacy and task value while learning mathematics. The study can supplement control value and selfdetermination theories and fill an empirical research gap by elucidating the effects of teachers’ autonomy support on students’ learning engagement.This study focused on the intrinsic and extrinsic factors involved in promoting junior high school students’ learning engagement in mathematics. The study investigated whether junior high school students’ perceived autonomy support would indirectly affect their learning engagement through self-efficacy and task value.The following hypotheses were proposed:Hypothesis 1. Students’ perceived autonomy support from teachers would predict self-efficacy, task value, and learning engagement.Hypothesis 2. Self-efficacy would predict learning engagement.Hypothesis 3. Task value would predict learning engagement.Hypothesis 4. The theoretical model used in this study would fit the observed data related to Taiwanese junior high school students.The participants were 1697 eighth-grade Taiwanese students from 30 classes in 10 junior high schools. In total, 869 participants were girls (51.21%) and 828 were boys (48.79%).The instruments used in the study included the teachers’ autonomy support scale, self-efficacy scale, task value scale, and learning engagement scale. Participants answered questions by indicating their agreement on a 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). The collected data were analyzed through structural equation modeling.Information on each scale used is presented as follows:Teachers’ autonomy support scale: Students’ perceptions of teachers’ autonomy support has been assessed using the learning climate questionnaire (LCQ; Shih, 2009). This questionnaire has sustained reliability and validity when used in the Taiwanese context (Shih, 2009). Furthermore, a confirmatory factor analysis of the data pertaining to the 1697 participants produced the following results: χ2(9, N = 1, 697) = 152.45, p < .05, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .097, goodness of fit index (GFI) = .97, adjusted GFI (AGFI) = .93, normed fit index (NFI) = .98, nonnormed fit index (NNFI) = .97, comparative fit index (CFI) = .98, incremental fit index (IFI) = .98, relative fit index (RFI) = .97. The Cronbach’s α value was .87.Self-efficacy scale: Students’ self-efficacy has been assessed using the motivated strategies for learning questionnaire (MSLQ; Wu & Cherng, 1992). The measure has sustained reliability and validity when used in the Taiwanese context (Wu & Cherng, 1992). The results suggested that this model had a reasonable fit with the proposed scale structure [χ2(5, N = 1, 697) = 92.12, p < .05, RMSEA = .10, GFI = .98, AGFI = .94, NFI = .99, NNFI = .98, CFI = .99, IFI = .99, RFI = .98; Cronbach’s α = .92].Task value scale: Students’ task value has been assessed using the MSLQ (Wu & Cherng, 1992). This measure has sustained reliability and validity when used in the Taiwanese context (Wu & Cherng, 1992). The results indicated that this model had a reasonable fit with the proposed scale structure [χ2(6, N = 1, 697) = 44.84, p < .05, RMSEA = .06, GFI = .99, AGFI = .97, NFI = 1.00, NNFI = .99, CFI = 1.00, IFI = 1.00, RFI = .99; Cronbach’s α = .92].Learning engagement scale: Students’ learning engagement has been assessed using the learning engagement scale (Lai & Wu, 2017), which contained effort, attention, and persistence subscales. This measure has sustained reliability and validity in the Taiwanese context (Lai & Wu, 2017). This model had a reasonable fit with the proposed scale structure [χ2(87, N = 1, 697) = 921.66, p < .05, RMSEA = .075, GFI = .93, AGFI = .91, NFI =.99, NNFI = .99, CFI = .99, IFI = .99, RFI = .99; the Cronbach’s α for the effort, attention, and persistence subscales were .93, .95, and .92, respectively].A correlation analysis revealed that teachers’ perceived autonomy support was positively related to self-efficacy, task value, and learning engagement. Additionally, self-efficacy and task value were positively related to learning engagement.The statistical results indicated that all of indices, except for the chi-squared test value [χ2(31, N = 1, 697) = 1186.74, p < 0.05], demonstrated a reasonable fit between the theoretical model and the observed data (GFI = .88, AGFI = .78, and RMSEA = .15). All relative fit indices [NFI = .94, NNFI = .91, CFI = .94, IFI = .94 and RFI = .91] exceeded the standard value of .90. Finally, the parsimony normed fit index (PNFI) was 0.65 and the parsimony goodness fit index (PGFI) was .50. These results indicate that this theoretical model had excellent overall fit with observed data, indicating that the model is suitable for characterizing Taiwanese junior high school students.Regarding the fit of the model’s internal structure, the statistical results indicated that all of the estimated parameter values of factor loadings achieved statistical significance, with standardized estimated values being between .80 and .95. The individual item reliability valueswere between .64 and .90, conforming to the measurement standard of .50. The composite reliability values of the four latent variables of teachers’ autonomy support, self-efficacy, task value, and learning engagement were .90, .91, .88, and .89, respectively; all these values were higher than the measurement standard of .60. The average variances extracted (AVE) from these variables (teachers’ autonomy support, self-efficacy, task value, and learning engagement) were .81, .84, .71 and .73, respectively. Again, all these values were higher than the measurement standard of .50. Therefore, this theoretical model exhibited good fit with the model’s internal structure.According to our results, students’ perceived autonomy support from teachers positively affected their self-efficacy (γ11 = .52, t = 19.44, p < .05), task value (γ21 = .55, t = 20.53, p < .05), and learning engagement (γ31 = .26, t = 8.85, p < .05). Students’ self-efficacy positively affected their learning engagement (β31 = .46, t = 5.49, p < .05). Finally, students’ task value positively affected their learning engagement (β32 = .13, t = 16.99, p < .05).The study results can be summarized as follows: (a) The theoretical model had good fit with the empirical results. (b) Teachers’ autonomy support had direct effects on self-efficacy, task value, and learning engagement and indirect effects on learning engagement through self-efficacy and task value. If teachers can effectively communicate with students, understand their learning status, provide them with the opportunity to make independent decisions, give timely feedback, and reduce teacher’s control teaching styles, such teachers have a high likelihood of enhancing students’ self-efficacy and task value. (c) Self-efficacy had direct effects on learning engagement. (d) Task value had direct effects on learning engagement. Thus, to enhance students’ learning engagement in teaching practice, teachers should cultivate students’ self-efficacy and task value and help them develop their confidence and interest in learning activities. On the basis of these results, this study has several implications for educational practice. Relevant suggestions for future research are provided.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2930,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationships among Parental Emotional Support, Emotional Intelligence, and Subjective Well-Being of High School Students: A Mediating Effect Analysis","Hong-Lien Chen, Ho-Tang Wu","parental emotional support, subjective well-being, emotional intelligence","Parental emotional support, emotional intelligence, and subjective well-being are critical factors that affect the physical and mental development of high school students. Parenting style can determine adaptability, and affectionate parenting is conducive to emotional development. Children are more likely to develop high levels of emotional intelligence if their family members can satisfy their psychological needs and provide sufficient emotional support. Emotional intelligence is not innate; rather, it is an intrapersonal skill that can be cultivated. Furthermore, the literature has revealed that parental emotional support influences the emotional intelligence of children, which affects their subjective well-being. Thus, emotional intelligence can mediate the relationship between parental emotional support and subjective well-being. The researchers searched for the keywords “parental emotional support,” “emotional intelligence,” and “subjective well-being” in Chinese-language literature databases, such as Airiti Library and Chinese language version of Google Scholar. The results indicated that no studies had analyzed the aforementioned mediating effect of emotional intelligence. The following hypothesis was proposed: The emotional intelligence of high school students would mediate the relationship between parental emotional support and subjective well-being. The purpose of this study was to verify the mediating effect of emotional intelligence and to address research gaps. To verify the aforementioned hypothesis, we developed three scales to conduct a questionnaire survey. We revised the Emotional Support Subscale (seven items) from the short-form Egna Minnen av Barndoms Uppfostran Scale developed by Arrindell et al. (1999), and the revised form was used to measure parental emotional support. The original scale was proposed in 1999, and its participants were secondary school students and adults in Sweden; this relatively old scale targeting individuals from a different culture may be unsuitable for Taiwanese students. Therefore, a pretest was performed. An Emotional Intelligence Inventory was designed according to the Emotional Intelligence Scale proposed by Chiang (2001). The original scale was proposed over a decade ago and consists of 60 items; thus, we developed a condensed version to prevent participants from becoming bored and tired, which could have affected the accuracy of survey results. The shortened version was subjected to a pretest. A Subjective Well-being Inventory was developed based on two scales. The first was the Emotional Well-beings” Subscale of the Teacher’s Subjective Well-being Scale proposed by Yu et al. (2011). This scale has two dimensions: the commonly accepted notion of happiness and perceived life satisfaction. The other scale used to develop the Subjective Wellbeing Inventory was the Chinese Happiness Inventory developed by Lu (1998). This scale targeted adults aged 18–65 years in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. The scale of Yu et al. was designed for teachers, whereas that of Lu was designed for the general public. Therefore, we selected items with high universal representativeness and that were suitable for high school students. The three inventories were rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale with scores of 1 (strongly disagree), 2 (partly agree), 3 (agree), 4 (mostly agree), and 5 (strongly agree). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) results indicated that the Inventories of Parental Emotional Support, Emotional Intelligence, and Subjective Well-being exhibited desirable composite reliability, average variance extracted, and discriminant validity. These inventories were employed to conduct a survey involving 918 Taiwanese vocational high school and senior high school students. The participants were mainly female (52.50%; 482 individuals), and first-, second-, and third-grade students accounted for 41.29% (397), 29.41% (270), and 27.34% (251) of the total sample, respectively. Survey responses were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), and a model was constructed in which emotional intelligence mediates the relationship between a father and mother’s emotional support and a student’s subjective well-being. At first, Amos (covariance-based SEM software) , manufactured by International Business Machines Corporation, New York, USA, was adopted for SEM, but the model fit indices indicated a poor fit. Moreover, the multivariate normality test result was significant, which suggested that the collected data had a non-normal distribution. Therefore, the researchers used Smart PLS 3.0, a variance-based SEM software program that is not limited by normal distribution. In addition, common method variance (CMV), a common problem in questionnaire surveys, had to be controlled. CMV is the bias caused by a research method in which the correlation between two variables is inflated or deflated. To avoid CMV, we designed a marker variable as the control variable. Theoretically, a marker variable should not be uncorrelated with the variables of interest; The latent variable “interpersonal understanding” was designated as the CMV variable.The mediating effect process was analyzed with reference to the method of Hair Jr et al. (2016) using three steps. Step 1: The researchers verified whether the path coefficient of the independent variable that predicts the dependent variable was significant. Step 2: The researchers confirmed that the path coefficients of the independent variable that predicted the mediator and those of the mediator that predicted the dependent variable were significant. Step 3: The researchers analyzed the mediation model only when the variables in Steps 1 and 2 were confirmed to be significantly correlated. In the present study, the variables in Steps 1 and 2 were significantly correlated; thus, the mediation model could be analyzed.Before a mediation model analysis was conducted, the model fit was verified. The results indicated that the factor loading, composited reliability, average variance extracted, and discriminant validity all satisfied relevant criteria and showed that the measurement model (called “outer model” in PLS-SEM) was appropriate. Second, values for collinearity, R2, f 2, and Q2 all conformed to the standard structural model (called “inner model ” in PLS-SEM); that is, the structural pattern was appropriate.All the paths reached significance, and the mediating effect was then measured using the variance accounted for (VAF), which was calculated by dividing the indirect effect by the total effect. According to Hair Jr et al. (2016), percentage VAF of > 80%, 20%, –80%, and < 20% represent full mediation, partial mediation, and no mediation, respectively. Accordingly, our research results demonstrated that emotional intelligence partially mediated the relationship between parental emotional support (both from a father and a mother) and subjective well-being. The researchers then verified whether this partial mediating effect was significant. The built-in bootstrapping function of Smart PLS was employed for this task, with the number of bootstrap samples set at 5,000. The results indicated that emotional intelligence significantly mediated the relationship between a father and mother’s emotional support and a student’s subjective well-being. The mediation model analysis revealed that the path coefficients of both a father and mother’s emotional support on the subjective well-being and emotional intelligence of (vocational) high school students indicated significant and positive correlations. Furthermore, the path coefficient between emotional intelligence and subjective well-being indicated a significant and positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the proposed hypothesis (i.e., the emotional intelligence of high school students would mediate the relationship between parental emotional support and subjective well-being) was supported.According to these findings, we propose that parents should provide emotional support to their children more often, which would help children develop emotional intelligence and improve their subjective well-being. High school students should actively attempt to develop their emotional intelligence. Suggestions for future research and research limitations are discussed herein.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2931,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Savoring Strategies Moderate the Relationship between Junior High School Novice and Senior Teachers’ Savoring Beliefs and Level of Flourishing in Life,Po-Lin Chen,"savoring beliefs, savoring strategies, flourishing life, senior teachers, novice teachers","Flourishing is a relatively new concept in positive psychology that considers hedonic and eudaimonic aspects of well-being. Although great emphasis has been placed on stress and burnout among school teachers, little attention has been given to these teachers’ well-being. Savoring can be defined as an individual’s strategy for directing their attention to positive experiences and regulating their positive feelings in response to positive events. Savoring is an effective regulation tactic characterized by the ability to focus on and exert control over the development, intensification, and sustainment of positive emotions. Bryant and Veroff (2007) proposed several cognitive and behavioral savoring strategies that are effective in enhancing and prolonging positive experiences, including sharing the experience with others (seeking out people with whom one can enjoy an event or report one’s appreciation of the moment), behavioral expression (laughing or emoting), counting blessings (cultivating gratitude), self-congratulation (cultivating pride), memory building (purposefully attempting to remember the positive event), and sensory-perceptual sharpening (focusing on the physical sensations of a pleasant experience). Chen and Yu (2018) reviewed this study and proposed that a flourishing life is one that involves mercifulness (blessing positive emotions ), playfulness (blessing engagement), peacefulness (blessing identifying meaning), respectfulness (blessing competent requirements), and cheerfulness (blessing an optimistic attitude). The main purpose of this study is to explore the relationships among beliefs about savoring, the capacity to savor, and a flourishing life in junior high school special and general education teachers. Nine hundred eighty-nine junior high school teachers were recruited to participate in a series of web-based and paperbased surveys. Novice (n = 207) and senior junior high school teachers (n = 413) participated in this study. The initial sample comprised 822 women (83.1%) and 167 men (16.9%). The educational levels of participants included university (n = 426, 43.1%) and graduate levels (n = 563, 56.9%). The major measurements for this study were the “Savoring Beliefs Inventory,” the “Ways of Savoring Checklist,” and the “Flourishing Life Scale.” The Savoring Beliefs Inventory is a 9-item self-report measure designed to assess the extent to which individuals savor positive experiences. Savoring is a multidimensional construct that contains three subscales: anticipation, reminiscing, and in-the-moment savoring. However, only total scores were calculated in this study. Furthermore, a shortened version (18 items) of the Ways of Savoring Checklist was used. We developed the shortened version by selecting three highly loading items from each of the six savoring subscales proposed by Bryant and Veroff (2007). The six savoring dimensions evaluated sharing with others, memory building, self-congratulation, behavioral expression, making downward comparisons, and sensory-perceptual sharpening. A shortened version (23 items) of the Flourishing Life Scale (FLS; adapted from Chen & Yu, 2018) was also used. We developed the shortened version by selecting three highly loading items from each of the five savoring subscales proposed by Chen and Yu (2018). The five flourishing life dimensions evaluated mercifulness (positive emotions), playfulness (engagement), peacefulness (identifying meaning), respectfulness (adequate guidelines), and cheerfulness (an optimistic attitude). The moderating effects of capacity to savor were tested using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis according to the steps of Baron and Kenny’s (1986) moderating model. To reduce the occurrence of multicollinearity problems, standard z-scores were used. Details on the data analyses are provided in the findings. The results demonstrated the following: (1) The average scores of senior teachers were significantly higher than those of novice teachers for “flourishing life,” “mercifulness (blessing positive emotions),” “playfulness (blessing engagement)”, “harmony (blessing identifying meaning),” “respectfulness (blessing competent requirements),” and “optimism (blessing an optimistic attitude).” The literature has indicated that adults in late adulthood have higher scores for “flourishing life,” “mercifulness (blessing positive emotions),” and “playfulness (blessing engagement)” than those in other stages of adulthood do (Chen & Yu, 2018). Because potential differences are present in flourishing life for various stages of adulthood, the results cannot be completely analogized to teachers. However, the findings of this study indicate that, for senior teachers, their seniority provides them with a better understanding of their living environment; as their seniority and age increase, their level of flourishing in life increases . Previously, research indicated that the well-being of senior female teachers in primary schools increased with their age, maturity, and accumulation of teaching experience, which enabled them to achieve a flourishing life (Lee, 2007). By comparison, novel teachers scored higher than senior teachers in “expectation,” “memory,” “savoring strategies,” “sharing with others,” and “behavioral expression.” Savoring beliefs included not only feelings of pleasure but also feelings of anticipation and recollection. This process promotes, supports , and enhances successful experiences; that is, it involves appreciation and enjoyment of positive experiences. When novice teachers begin teaching with positive feelings or experiences (such as savoring beliefs and strategies), their positive teaching experience can last longer. Even when negative events occur, such teachers can adopt effective coping methods, thus weakening the negativity of the experiences and the subsequent negative feelings, which enables them to understand and adapt to the variability of educational work. (2) The savoring strategies of senior teachers and other factors (behavioral expression, memory building, self-congratulation, sensoryperceptual sharpening, and making downward comparisons) played a moderating role in the relationship between savoring beliefs and flourishing life. Senior teachers express positive emotions, store interesting experiences or activities for future recollection, and remind themselves that achieving the status of senior teachers was difficult. They can compare their own feelings with those of others and, in doing so, have positive experiences, which play a moderating role in the relationship between savoring beliefs and flourishing life.Furthermore, when senior teachers strengthen their perceptual strategies, they can attempt to stop or slow the passing of positive events. The ability to block one type of sensory perception to strengthen other sensory perceptions plays a moderating role in the relationship between savoring beliefs and flourishing life. However, for the interactions of savoring strategies, teachers with high-level savoring strategies (including constructing memories, making downward comparisons, and sensory- perceptual sharpening) are inferior to those with low-level savoring strategies (including constructing memories, inferior accumulation of memories , and sensory-perceptual sharpening) when both have a low level of savoring beliefs. However, when senior teachers have low-level savoring beliefs, those with a high level of self-congratulation are more likely to use self-congratulation than those with low level of self-congratulation, whereas groups with either highlevel or low-level behavioral expression are less likely to use this strategy. These results indicate that senior teachers with lowlevel savoring beliefs use high-level and low-level savoring strategies differently according to the extent to which they have a flourishing life , with higher level savoring strategies leading to a more flourishing life. However, “sharing” does not play a moderating role in the relationship between savoring beliefs and flourishing life. This indicates that senior teachers are less likely to seek out partners to share their experiences with and to tell others of the significance of positive experiences to them. (3) Although savoring strategies are not the most important factor for novice teachers, novice teachers have higher levels of “sharing with others” and “behavioral expression” than senior teachers do. These two strategies do not have a moderating effect on the relationship between savoring beliefs and flourishing life. However, these results indicate that, in the early stages of teaching, teachers can more easily handle teaching problems if they have someone to share and explain the significance of experiences with and to whom they can express positive emotions outside of work. Regarding the limitations of this study, although novice and senior teachers can be further divided into different stages of teaching, only seniority was used in this study. In future studies, teachers should be asked to provide their length of service to enable a more detailed analysis. In addition, the reliability of the Savoring Beliefs Scale used in this study and the factor loads of some items are low, indicating that a large measurement error may be present in the results and this scale requires revision. Furthermore, future studies should include junior high school teachers from different teaching disciplines and indicate whether the teachers are required to also complete administrative work, both of which may influence teachers’ emotions. In future studies, longitudinal studies should be completed to track the changes in teachers’ savoring beliefs, savoring strategies, and flourishing in life.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2932,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Dear Students, in Fact, I Am…: LGBQ Teachers’ Decisions of Whether to Come Out at Work and Their Teaching Experiences","Hung Chiao, Shu-Yang Liao, Yi-Chia Chiu, Yun-Ting Lin, Shih-Ying Chen","coming out, homophobia, LGBQ teachers, sexual prejudice, Tongzhi","Objective: Several studies (Chung, 2019; Hsiu & Zhou, 2016; Shih, 2005; Yeh, 2009; Yuan, 2014) have reported that Taiwanese lesbian and gay teachers do not often consider “coming out,” that is, disclosing their sexual orientation, at school due to unpredictable risks, such as stigmatization or loss of their jobs or teaching qualifications due to complaints from parents. Chao et al. (2008) reported that LGBQ teachers may disguise themselves, indirectly or openly come out at work, or separate their professional and personal lives. Although previous studies have presented reasons and strategies for LGBQ teachers not coming out, few studies investigated the intersections of LGBQ identities and career practices, including in teaching practices and decisions regarding whether to come out at work. This study investigated LGBQ teachers’ decision-making process and their experiences of coming out or not coming out to their colleagues and students in the workplace. This study also examined the intersections of LGBQ identity development and career practices among LGBQ teachers. Method: We interviewed five LGBQ educators (3 biologically female and 2 biologically male teachers; one of whom identified as lesbian, one as questioning, one as bisexual, and two as Tongzhi, a gender-neutral term for a sexual minority in the Chinese language) working at different educational levels (one at an elementary school, three at middle schools of different levels, and one teaching in a 4-year university course) and learned why and how they intentionally chose to disclose or not to disclose their LGBQ identities in the workplace and how those experiences affected their teaching work. A narrative paradigm was used to investigate how the teachers’ LGBQ identities, personal beliefs, and professional and educational values intertwined and how their LGBQ identities influenced their professional situations and career development. Results: We collected the participants’ accounts of their LGBQ identities and identity development process, their teaching philosophies and experiences, the attitudes toward LGB issues they have encountered in their workplaces, and how they presented themselves to students and colleagues in their workplaces. One participant experienced discrimination from his supervisor when in teaching practicum, which almost caused him to lose his teaching qualification. Another participant reported her experience of being sexually harassed by a male faculty member, which later led to obstacles in the tenure process. Others reported hearing discriminatory language against LGBQ individuals, or they worried that their school principals would yield to conservative parents and not support them at work, which led them to protect themselves by presenting themselves as heterosexual allies at work. All the participants incorporated gender equity perspectives and materials in their teaching and services. Although only the participant teaching at the university was openly out to her students, two more participants reported that they had privately come out to their LGBQ students to support them, indicating that despite the risks of negative outcomes at work, some LGBQ teachers are willing to reveal their “real identity” for their students rather than for themselves. This study proposes a model to investigate the intersectionality of teacher (professional) identity and LGBQ (private) identity in school and social contexts. In this model, Taiwanese LGBQ teachers consider conservative educational environments and potential protests from parents to be obstacles to coming out at schools. However, they are more willing to come out to more effectively provide learning support to LGBQ students and to build a closer relationship with such students based on their shared stigmatized identity. The model also considerably accounts for temporal factors because identity development and social contexts are time-dependent. LGBQ teachers at different stages in the LGBQ identity development process tend to make different decisions because of the impact of society on individual and collective perspectives. For example, Taiwan Constitutional Interpretation no. 748, which is known as the first same-sex marriage case, was announced in May 2017 and was passed and put into effect in 2019. From 2017 to 2019, Taiwanese society experienced enormous pressure from both proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage. LGBQ individuals may choose to expend the energy required to be “out and proud” or to hide and suppress their identity depending on their psychological strength or changes in family and social support that come with societal progress and personal identity development. The sociopolitical environment has changed drastically since the implementation of the Act for Interpretation 748, and the resulting societal changes have considerably affected educational systems and individuals involved in them. Discussion: The results of the present study indicate that Taiwanese LGBQ teachers, as sexual minorities, experience difficulties in finding a safe space in the field of education, which is dominated by heterosexualism. Although none of the participants experienced real job loss, we might interpret their worries not as internalized homophobia but as existential anxiety regarding social survival, especially because social death has serious outcomes in collectivistic and relation-oriented Taiwanese society. Regardless of the risks and lack of personal advantages associated with coming out, Taiwanese LGBQ teachers are still willing to come out for their students’ benefit. The intention and motivation of the actions of the teachers in the present study differ considerably from those reported in North American studies (Nielsen & Alderson, 2014), in which LGBQ faculty reported coming out for their own needs of being genuine or true to their personal identities. We believe that the intention of Taiwanese LGBQ teachers in coming out is based on the culturally informed principles of altruism and compassion. The most important implication of the study is that LGBQ teachers’ minority identities and life experiences strongly affect their career development and teaching; that is, the ability of LGBQ teachers to put their educational philosophies and strategies into practice and contribute at work depends on the how safe they feel in their work environment. Therefore, ensuring that school systems are accepting of gender- and sexual minorities is crucial not only for maintaining the optimal educational environment for students to achieve their goals but also for establishing a culturally sensitive and open work environment for teachers to exhibit their best teaching performance. The results of this study can elucidate the intersections between LGBQ teachers’ professional identities, development, and practices and their LGBQ identities; identity development; and lifestyles and the implications of these intersections. Discussions of intersectional identities and the effect of such identities on teaching practices are not regularly incorporated into teacher training in Taiwan, and more research on intersectional identities must be incorporated into teacher education and professional development. Education is a career of life influencing life; therefore, promoting awareness of how identities are shaped by life experiences among future teachers is crucial. Furthermore, LGBQ identities and issues related to coming out in different career fields must be thoroughly investigated in the future to raise awareness of homophobia and sexual prejudice and to reduce the oppression of sexual and gender minorities.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2935,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Validation of the General Awe Scale,"Min-Ning Yu, Shih-Yao Hsiung, Ya-Han Hsu, Ya-Yun Weng","awe, self-transcendent emotion, scale construction and development, positive psychology","Awe is one of the eight positive emotions proposed by Vaillant (2008a, 2008b). McDougall (1910) first described the concept of awe, which includes admiration imbued with senses of power and wonder as well as the meaning of a peak experience. Ekman (1992) and Valdesolo and Graham (2014) suggested that awe is a special, complex, and unique emotion. Stellar et al. (2017) suggested that awe is a self-transcendent emotion that involves admiration, inspiration, and elevation. By contrast, Keltner and Haidt (2003) considered awe’s core dimensions to be senses of vastness and accommodation. Vastness refers to stimuli that strain one’s perception in terms of personal frames of reference such as physical size (i.e., volume, area, quantity), social scale (i.e., fame), and symbolic markers of vast size (i.e., a lavish office). The congeniality indicates that such a vastness triggers a cognitive discordance that might induce an imbalance between one’s perception and behavior. Therefore, one must accommodate the present situation and balance cognitive reference frames, experiencing one’s smallness, powerlessness, and confusion. Once such an accommodation takes effect, feelings pertaining to enlightenment and rebirth may arise. If not, fear and a feeling of being threatened may ensue. Therefore, feelings of awe may be identified when a powerful situation accompanied by an inclination to submit occurs, or when a difficult-to-explain situation accompanied by a feeling of amazement, surprise, or confusion occurs. Such feelings of awe can be categorized as positive affect or emotions that promote happiness (Shiota et al., 2007). Regarding causation, a given object or event is necessary to elicit a feeling of awe. This cause usually lies in a rich, attractive source, such as art, technology, or landscapes. Awe cannot be elicited without a cause (Keltner & Haidt, 2003; Shiota et al., 2007), but it can be induced by objects such as landscapes (Shiota et al., 2007), outer space (Bonner & Friedman, 2011), human achievement (Keltner & Haidt, 2003; Thomson & Siegel, 2017), artworks, music, powerful leaders (Keltner & Haidt, 2003), natural disaster, and epidemic disease (Piff et al., 2015). Furthermore, the mechanism underlying awe is different among cultures (Nakayama et al., 2020). Awe is considered a positive emotion in Western culture but is considered a complex mixture of positive and negative emotions in Eastern culture. In East Asia, people usually view the negative aspect of awe in a positive light, and vice versa. This represents an example of dialectical thinking (Peng & Nisbett, 1999).Theory and research have supported the notion that awe can strengthen not only the positive behavior, well-being, and psychological capital but also student learning outcomes and self-effectiveness (McCullough et al., 2002; Saroglou et al., 2008; Van Cappellen & Saroglou, 2012; Weinstein et al., 2009). Therefore, awe can be considered a self-transcendent emotion (Stellar et al., 2017) that helps enhance perceptions of well-being. However, to date, few studies have explored the mechanisms underlying the emotion of awe. To fill this literature gap, this study focused on the development of measurement properties for the General Awe Scale (GAS). On the basis of a literature review, we developed the first draft of the GAS, which comprises 50 items pertaining to the following 5 dimensions: (1) curiosity and exploration, (2) a feeling of wonderment regarding nature, (3) appreciation of artwork, (4) a feeling of smallness, and (5) social connection. The development of the GAS was divided into the following two stages. In the first stage, 384 college students were recruited for the pilot study, and the collected data were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and internal consistency analysis to develop the final 27-item scale. In the second stage, 720 college students were recruited and surveyed; the statistical analysis methods used were confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), alpha reliability, and criterion-related validity. In this study, data were collected using an online survey that was distributed on relevant social media platforms used at several Taiwanese universities. The research data including demographic variables as well as travel frequency, religious activity participation, meditation frequency, stress levels, and learning satisfaction were collected using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (Fang, 2012), Prosocial Scale, Taiwan Subjective Well-Being Scale (Short-Form; Yu et al., 2017), Gratitude Scale (Lin, 2012), and Spirituality Well-Being Scale (Chung et al., 2013). The results are summarized as follows:1. The CFA results supported the notion that the GAS was composed of five latent factors, namely (1) curiosity and exploration, (2) a feeling of wonderment regarding nature, (3) appreciation of artwork, (4) a feeling of smallness, and (5) social connection.2. The results revealed that the GAS satisfied the validity and reliability criteria.3. In this study, we adopted the notions of subjective well-being, prosocial behavior, spiritual-well-being, and gratitude as external criteria for validity confirmation. The results demonstrated that the GAS had significant positive relationships with these external criteria. The criterion-related validity of the GAS was thus verified.4. The majority of the survey respondents were ranked on the middle-to-high level of the GAS. Specifically, our data revealed that the students who had gone abroad in the past year had higher learning satisfaction and lower stress levels, reporting significantly higher GAS scores. In this study, we developed the structure of the GAS comprising 27 items that pertained to the aforementioned five dimensions. Similar to the findings of most Western studies, this study indicated that specific factors such as nature and artwork (Fingerhut & Prinz, 2018; Keltner & Haidt, 2003) can elicit the emotion of awe. Keltner and Haidt (2003) contended that awe consists of three types, namely awe regarding nature, god, and cognitive knowledge. These are consistent with the feeling of wonderment regarding nature and appreciation of artwork categories developed in this study.We discovered that awe can not only can enhance curiosity and desire for exploration but also make one feel small and powerless when connecting with society. These concepts are associated with the remaining three factors of the GAS, namely curiosity and exploration, a feeling of smallness, and social connection. Although some cultures believe that awe involves a complex fusion of positive and negative emotions. The results of this study suggested that awe was principally a positive emotion rather than a negative one; this viewpoint is more consistent with the conclusions of previous studies on the mechanism of the awe emotion.Moreover, awe was significantly correlated with the frequency of going abroad; hence, students who had been abroad recently registered higher GAS scores than those who had not, especially in the curiosity and exploration and social connection categories. These findings are consistent with those of a Chinese study (Tian et al., 2015) that suggested a significant positive association between travel experience and awe. A tourism-related study also demonstrated that personal involvement and experience was the most effective means of evoking awe (Bloemer & de Ruyter, 1999). For example, travelers can feel awe when becoming immersed in experiences of the world´s greatest buildings or historical temples (Keltner & Haidt, 2003), passing through grassland wilderness (Hall & Cole, 2012), or participating in music performances (Cotter et al., 2018).Compared with students who were under greater pressure, students with low stress levels recorded higher GAS scores. This result is also consistent with previous study findings indicating that when under pressure, people are less likely to behave and think positively (Darley & Batson, 1973). In addition, awe had a significant positive correlation with learning satisfaction, which suggests that students who felt they had good learning outcomes also had greater senses of awe. Gottlieb et al. (2018) also reported consistent results indicating that awe may be correlated with scientific learning, and Anderson et al. (2019) suggested that those with greater senses of awe can more easily evoke learning curiosity and improve learning outcomes.In summary, this study demonstrated that awe enhances prosocial behavior, gratitude, subjective well-being, and spiritual well-being in Taiwanese individuals. Future studies should continue to study the impact, determinants, and causal processes underlying the emotion of awe to not only expand its application and understanding in positive human behaviors but also promote the development of a harmonious and peaceful society.Future studies can focus on tourism, ecological conservation, or adventure education. In the case of adventure education, using virtual reality technology allows users to experience dangerous situations (e.g., bungee jumping, rock climbing, and outer space) as though they were right at the scene. Thus, viewing such vast and magnificent scenery that completely differs from one’s everyday experience can compensate for the decreased travel opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic and enhance individuals’ sense of awe and awe-induced experience, reinforcing positive behaviors and learning outcomes.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2933,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Use of Avoidance Strategies in Taiwanese Junior High School Students and Such Strategies’ Relationship to Classroom Goal Structures and Feelings of Shame,"Shu-Ling Peng, Biing-Lin Cherng","avoidance strategies, classroom goal structures, cross-sectional and longitudinal designs, shame","Studies have revealed that students often intentionally employ avoidance strategies, which may lead to a loss of selfconfidence, low academic achievement, or even dropout. Furthermore, the emergence of the use of avoidance strategies may be a predictor of students’ discontinuation of their education (Butler, 1998; Turner et al., 2002; Urdan, 2004). According to Turner et al. (2002), common avoidance strategies among students are help avoidance, resisting novel approaches to academic work (i.e., novelty avoidance), and purposefully withdrawing effort (i.e., self-handicapping). Students may employ these strategies because, according to the self-worth theory (Covington, 1992), they wish to divert others’ attention from their abilities when they are unsure of being able to complete a task; avoidance strategies are a means of protecting their self-worth.In this study, we integrated achievement goal theory (Ames, 1992) and academic emotion theory (Pekrun et al., 2002) to investigate the relationships among students’ perceived classroom goal structures, feelings of shame, and use of avoidance strategies; we further investigated the means through which students’ perceived classroom goal structure indirectly influences their avoidance strategies through feelings of shame. Related studies have reported that middle school students’ motivation and performance decline over time (Shim et al., 2013; Urdan & Midgley, 2003), indicating that, if a researcher collects data at a single time point to test the relationships among variables (i.e., a cross-sectional design), the researcher would be unable to ascertain whether the variables change over time, the direction of such changes, and whether the changes in the variables are interrelated. In addition, studies of middle school students have mostly focused on changes in students’ adaptive learning patterns rather than changes in their maladaptive learning patterns (e.g., feelings of shame and avoidance strategies) over time. In consideration of these factors, we conducted two measurements: one in the second semester of the seventh grade and one in the first semester of the eighth grade. We first investigated the relationship among perceived classroom goal structure, shame, and avoidance strategies in seventh grade and eighth grade students (cross-sectional design). We then evaluated the changes in the three variables and the directions of these changes and determined whether these changes were interrelated from the second semester of seventh grade to the first semester of eighth grade.The aims of this study were (1) to test whether the variables of perceived classroom goal structure, shame, and avoidance strategies change over time and the directions of the changes and (2) to investigate the relationships among perceived classroom goal structure, shame, and avoidance strategies by using both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. Two research questions guided the study: (1) Do perceived classroom goal structure, shame, and avoidance strategies change over time, and what are the directions of these changes? (2) Are perceived classroom goal structure, shame, and avoidance strategies interrelated in seventh and eighth grade, and are the relationships connected from the second semester of seventh grade to the first semester of eighth grade?For research question 1, we hypothesized that students’ self-reported scores in perceived mastery-goal structure would gradually increase and that those in perceived performance-goal structure, shame, and avoidance strategies would gradually decrease. For research question 2, we hypothesized that students’ self-reported scores in perceived mastery-goal structure would negatively (or nonsignificantly) predict shame, which would then negatively (or nonsignificantly) predict avoidance strategies. We further hypothesized that students’ self-reported scores in perceived performance-goal structure would positively predict shame, which would then positively predict avoidance strategies (research hypothesis 2-1). Moreover, we hypothesized that decreases in perceived mastery goal structure would negatively (or nonsignificantly) predict increases in shame, which would then negatively (or nonsignificantly) predict increases in avoidance strategies. Finally, we hypothesized that increases in perceived performance-goal structure would positively predict increases in shame, which would then positively predict increases in avoidance strategies (research hypothesis 2-2).Students from 21 seventh-grade classes of 12 Taiwanese junior high schools were recruited as participants. This study was longitudinal with two measurement waves to evaluate avoidance strategies, perceived classroom goal structure, and shame. The first measurement was conducted in April 2018 (the second semester of seventh grade), and the second was conducted in October 2018 (the first semester of eighth grade). All students who participated in the study remained in the same classes in seventh and eighth grade. This study was approved by the relevant university ethics committee, and initially, 442 students volunteered to participate (with written parental consent). However, the data from 14 participants were not included in the analyses because these participants were not present for all sessions. The final sample comprised 427 students (206 boys and 221 girls). The mean age of the students was 13.89 (SD = 0.75) years.A half-school-year longitudinal study was conducted to evaluate perceived classroom goal structures (mastery vs. performance), shame, and avoidance strategies in mathematics. Participants completed self-reported questionnaires, evaluating their perceived classroom goal structure, feelings of shame, and avoidance strategies. Two theoretical models, using crosssectional and longitudinal designs, were developed to test the relationships among these variables. The collected data were analyzed using structural equational modeling. In addition, prior mathematical achievement and sex were included in the analyses and were considered control variables.For research hypothesis 1, the results indicated that, from the second semester of seventh grade to the first semester of eighth grade, students’ perceptions of a mastery- goal structure did not significantly change, whereas their perceptions of a performance-goal structure, feelings of shame, and use of avoidance strategies significantly increased. For research hypothesis 2-1, the results of cross-sectional analyses indicated that students who perceived their class as more performance goal–oriented felt more shame and used more avoidance strategies. However, for students who perceived their class as more mastery goal–oriented, this perception did not significantly predict their feelings of shame and use of avoidance strategies. For research hypothesis 2-2, the results of longitudinal analyses demonstrated that an increase in perceptions of a performance goal–oriented class structure predicted increases in shame over the half school year, which in turn predicted increases in employment of avoidance strategies. By contrast, perceptions of a mastery goal–oriented class structure with no changes did not reliably predict changes in shame and employment of avoidance strategies.Two main conclusions may be drawn from the present study. First, our results partly support the hypothesis that students’ maladaptive learning patterns (i.e., perceptions of a performance-goal structure, feelings of shame, and use of avoidance strategies) gradually increase in mathematics from seventh grade to eighth grade. Second, our findings suggest that classroom environments that emphasize obtaining rewards, recognition of competence, and outperforming others based on norm-based standards are more likely to result in students experiencing feelings of shame and using avoidance strategies. Recommendations are proposed on the basis of these findings that may serve as a reference for further research, teaching practices, and junior high school counseling.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2936,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effect of Sandtray in the Discrimination Model of Supervision on Supervisee Anxiety and Supervisory Effectiveness: A Study of a 12-Session Sandtray Supervision,Mei-Hsiang Tsai,"discrimination model, sandtray supervision, supervisee anxiety, supervisory effectiveness","In Taiwan, the Psychologists Act was passed almost 20 years ago. According to the regulations, counseling psychology education must consist of core professional courses and 1-year full-time internship (Psychologist Act, 2020). This internship is a necessary component in which counselors-in-training integrate the knowledge acquired in their professional courses into counseling practice. As part of practical learning during the full-time internship, gaining supervision experience is essential.During the past decade, creative supervision of expressive arts such as puppet play, sandtray activities, and drawing has gradually developed and received increased attention. The creative activities in creative supervision involve interactive relationships among the supervisor, supervisee, and client. The symbolic and metaphoric communication in these relationships can be presented through creative works and can deepen the discussions between supervisor and supervisee. Creative works can assist the supervisee in expanding the vision of a client’s inner world and in expressing their personal emotions. Creative approaches also support the supervisor in enhancing their supervisory working alliance and supervisory effectiveness. Sandtray therapy, developed by Lowenfeld (1979), creates a safe and protective space in which individuals can exercise control, lower their defenses, overcome resistance, set boundaries and limits, address interpersonal and intrapersonal problems, and express non-verbalized emotional concerns. With its nonverbal characteristics, sandtray therapy is beneficial in terms of both counseling and clinical supervision.The discrimination model of clinical supervision contains two dimensions that cover the foci of supervision and roles of the supervisor, all of which unite in a three-by-three matrix to form nine supervisory strategies. The foci of supervision comprise intervention, conceptualization, and personalization skills, and the roles of the supervisor comprise teacher, counselor, and consultant (Bernard, 1979; Bernard & Goodyear, 2019).This study explored the impact of sandtray in a discrimination model of supervision on supervisee anxiety and supervisory effectiveness. Five pairs of full-time counseling interns and their clinical supervisors were recruited from three university student counseling centers as research participants. The five supervisors all had master’s degrees in counseling psychology and 5 to 10 years of practical experience. The five supervisees were enrolled in master’s counseling programs and were participating in full-time internships. Before conducting sandtray supervision, the supervisors received 2 days of professional training in sandtray therapy, discrimination supervision modeling, and applying sandtray in a discrimination model of supervision, with a total of 6 days of training. This research focused on qualitative data that were supplemented with quantitative data. The supervisors conducted weekly individual sandtray sessions with discrimination supervision with their paired supervisees for a total of 12 sessions. The supervision process was based on the six sandtray steps in the discrimination model of supervision used in this study. All supervisors and supervisees participated in individual interviews after the fourth, eighth, and twelfth supervision sessions for a total of three interviews. Additionally, the supervisees completed the Anticipatory Supervisee Anxiety Scale prior to their sandtray supervision, and the supervisors completed the Sandtray Supervision Self-Evaluation Form after conducting sandtray supervision; each scale and form were thus completed 12 times. The interview data were analyzed using the content analysis method to understand the supervisees’ anticipatory supervision anxiety and to assess the supervisory effectiveness of the supervisor from the framework of the discrimination model of supervision. Scale data were analyzed using a non-parametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Based on the qualitative results, the themes of supervisees’ supervision anxiety included the following: the sandtray layout assisted in overcoming challenges and enhanced peace of mind; the sandtray carried emotions and situated anxiety; the sandtray picture represented a concrete story and its context; and the sandtray reflected the inner and developed strength. The following themes of supervisory effectiveness were observed: worries were overcome and confidence increased; control was maintained and the balance of the focus of supervision was considered; the role of the supervisor can be positive at times but it can also be negative; the working alliance was stabilized and understanding enhanced; and views were shared and effectiveness improved. The findings from the Anticipatory Supervisee Anxiety Scale demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in supervisee anxiety (Z = -2.02, p = .043) following the 12-week sandtray program with discrimination supervision. The results from the Sandtray Supervision Self-Evaluation Form revealed no statistical difference in supervisory effectiveness (Z = -1.22, p > .05). Based on the results of the study, the researcher offered four recommendations for future researchers. First, sandtray with the discrimination model of supervision can be conducted with supervisees at different stages of professional development, such as practicum interns and novice supervisors who have received supervisory training to explore the effectiveness of this supervision model. Second, the effect of sandtray, combined with other supervision models (e.g., integrated development, system-oriented, or self-awareness supervision models), on supervisory effectiveness must be investigated. Third, multiple interventions (e.g., once every other week or once a month) can be conducted to enrich the application of this model. Measurement of the retained effects on supervisory anxiety and supervisory effectiveness can also performed. Fourth, an effectiveness assessment tool for sandtray supervision could be introduced. Finally, according to the process and results of this study, the researcher proposed six practical suggestions for future sandtray supervision. First, the creative supervision model can be integrated into supervision training courses to enhance supervisors’ supervisory ability and diversify supervision approaches to increase supervisory effectiveness. Second, a sandtray therapy course can be offered as part of the counseling program. Learning about sandtray therapy can strength counseling students’ ability to apply symbolic and metaphoric concepts during their internships to enhance their counseling effectiveness. Third, sandtray supervisors are recommended to acquire knowledge and practical experience in play or sandtray therapy to ensure they are familiar with the expressive medium and the use of symbolic and metaphoric response skills. These trained sandtray supervisors could then provide clear and specific supervision direction during the sandtray supervision process. Fourth, sandtray supervisors must also be supervised after conducting sandtray supervision. Sandtray in the discrimination model of supervision combines two professional fields. At the beginning of a sandtray supervision session, sandtray supervisors can choose a supervision intervention strategy from the nine specified supervision strategies but may dynamically switch supervision strategies according to the supervision context and supervisees’ responses. Because the evaluation of the transition of the supervision strategy is related to the supervisors’ professional ability, supervisors can deepen their understanding and mastery of sandtray in the discrimination model of supervision when they receive individual or group supervision after performing supervision. Fifth, supervisees must have experimental experience in sandtray creation before being subjected to sandtray supervision. Because of the highly emotive and expressive characteristics of the sandtray medium, supervisees may feel surprised or panicked through their disclosure of their thoughts or emotions in the early stages of supervision. If supervisees have no sandtray experience, supervisors can offer experimental sandtray sessions to assess how supervisees react to the sandtay medium. Thus, supervisees can increase their familiarity with sandtray materials, which can strengthen their sense of security in sandtray creation. Sixth, to provide sufficient time for sandtray creation and discussion, each sandtray supervision session must be allotted at least 1.5 h. Therefore, supervisors and supervisees can deepen their discussion and exploration of the supervision content.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2937,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Work Convenience or Stress? The Relationship between the Work-Related Use of Instant Messaging Apps beyond Work Hours and Job Burnout in Teachers and the Moderating Role of Job Values,"Chih-Kang Lien, Chien-Hsiang Huang, Yu-Ching Chang, Yi-Ting Ruan","job burnout, job values, job stress, instant messaging apps","Evidence from around the world suggests that the profession of teaching induces a high level of job stress and job burnout. If individuals regularly experience severe job stress and its accompanying physical and psychological effects, they can experience fatigue in both physically and mentally challenging work situations (Brewer & McMahan, 2003; Platsidou & Agaliotis, 2008; Taylor, 1999). The most obvious antecedent of job burnout is job stress, with job burnout regarded as an extension or consequence of a prolonged period of job stress (Hung & Chen, 2009; Schaufeli & Buunk, 2003; Shirom, 2003).This study focused on the topic of job burnout in relation to teachers, and this study employed the three dimensions of burnout identified by Maslach and Jackson (1981) as the main reference framework; according to the confirmatory factor analysis results of each dimension, the two dimensions of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were applied as variables. The first goal of this research was to explore the effect of job burnout in teachers, as reflected in their use of instant messaging apps beyond official work hours. The rapid development of information technology has gradually changed conventional cognitive approaches toward work, with the boundary between work and personal time being increasingly obscured or disappearing entirely (Derks et al., 2014). Because the work environment of teachers requires them to interact with students, parents, colleagues, and school supervisors, the content of their messages sent using instant messaging apps beyond work hours is both diverse and complex. If instant messaging app use is a long-term work requirement, such use may exert physical and mental pressure for teachers and become a source of stress and a cause of job burnout (Bakker & Sanz-Vergel, 2020; Liu et al., 2019). According to relevant national and international research, teachers’ job stress is divided into three dimensions, namely the 1. stress of teaching, guidance and discipline, 2. administration, and 3. interacting with parents. The second goal of this research was to explore whether teachers use instant messaging apps for work purposes beyond official work hours, and if such use induces job stress, which can lead to job burnout. An individual’s perception of the value of their work affects their job selection, work behaviors (Lyons et al., 2006), and work attitude (Chu, 2008; Hung & Liu, 2003). To align the dimensions of integrity and separability with general job values, this study used the concepts of self-actualization, organizational safety, and physical and mental health, as proposed by Shen and Huang (2018), as the dimensions of teachers’ job values. Related empirical research has analyzed job values as a moderating variable in the relationship between work stressors and stress consequences, revealing that the job value dimension has a partially moderating effect on work stressors and stress consequences (Siu et al., 2003; Siu et al., 2005). Therefore, the third goal of this research was to clarify the potentially moderating role of job values in the relationship between receiving workrelated messages through instant messaging apps beyond work hours and teachers’ job stress. The study employed questionnaire surveys, with elementary school, senior high school, high school, and vocational high school teachers recruited as study participants. Regarding the target population and the representativeness of the study results, a 95% confidence interval was applied in which the error did not exceed .05. Using stratified random sampling, we administered 911 questionnaires and received 731 completed questionnaires. After the removal of the questionnaires from teachers who did not use instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours, 717 valid questionnaires remained. IBM SPSS 23.0 and AMOS 24.0 were used for statistical analyses, including data processing, confirmatory factor analysis for each scale, and correlation analysis for each variable. To verify discriminant validity between constructs, we conducted four-factor confirmatory factor analysis. The results of the absolute fit measure index were as follows: χ2 = 2788.748 (reached a significant level), GFI (goodness-of-fit index) = .82, AGFI (adjusted goodness-of-fit index) = .80, RMSEA (root mean square error of approximation) = .057. The results of the relative fit index were as follows: NFI (normed fit index) = .85, NNFI (non-normed fit index) = .88, CFI (comparative fit index) = .89. The parsimonious fit measure index results were as follows: PGFI (Parsimonious goodnessfit index) = .75, PNFI (parsimony-adjusted NFI) = .79, PCFI (parsimonious comparative-fit index) = .83. All of the test results for goodness of fit met the standard of model evaluation; therefore, the structural model used in this research had favorable goodness of fit. Additionally, we applied Hayes’ process model (2013) to detect mediation effects, adjustment effects, moderated mediation effects, and the interactions among various factors. The research results indicated that teachers’ use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours and job stress had a significantly positive relationship (r = .429, p < .01); the correlation coefficient of these two dimensions was within .176 and .371, which is consistent with the research results of Lee (2017), Chi and Tsai (2018), and Van Laethem et al. (2018). In addition, we further determined that teachers’ use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours and the overall effects of teachers’ job burnout were significantly correlated (c, r = .221, p < .001), which is in line with the findings of Chi and Tsai (2018), Liu et al. (2019), Sarafino (2001), Taylor (1999), and Van Laethem et al. (2018). The results of the overall effect analysis revealed the indirect and significant effect of job burnout (effect = .19, SE = .02, 95% CI = [ .15, .24]), but the direct effect did not reach significance (effect = -.004, SE = .03, 95% CI = [-.07, .06]). This result demonstrated that teachers’ job stress exhibited a complete intermediary effect on the relationship between teachers’ use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours and job burnout. Therefore, teachers’ use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours for a long period shapes their perceived stress, with job stress assuming a mediating role between teachers’ use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours and job burnout. This result aligns with those of Chi and Tsai (2018), Liu et al. (2019), and Binnewies et al. (2009). We also employed Model 7 in the SPSS PROCESS macro to test the confidence interval of the indirect effect and conditional indirect effect in the moderated mediation (Hayes, 2013). The indirect effect of teachers’ use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours on teachers’ job burnout reached significance when teachers’ job values were low (boot ab = .211, boot SE = .031, 95% boot CI = [ .153, .275]) and when their job values were high (boot ab = .173, boot SE = .023, 95% boot CI = [ .13, .22]). However, the average stress of teachers with low-level job values was still higher than that of teachers with high-level job values. Therefore, the long-term use of instant messaging apps for official business beyond work hours caused an accumulation of job pressure regardless of the level of teachers’ job values. This result is consistent with those of Siu et al. (2003) and Siu et al. (2005). Finally, we provided some suggestions for schools, educational authorities, principals, and education directors. The results of this study can be used as a reference for other studies on the work-related use of instant messaging apps beyond work hours and teachers’ job stress, job burnout, and job values.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2938,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Suffering Yourself in Love: Mediating Predictive Effect of Partners´ Perceived Interpersonal Behavior on the Relationship between Romantic Perfectionism and Relationship Satisfaction,"Ying-Ying Chang, Sung-Chun Tsai, Sung-Hsien Sun","model of structural analysis of social behavior (SASB), perception of partner´s interpersonal behavior, relationship satisfaction, romantic perfectionism, romantic relationship","Numerous studies have observed that self-oriented and other-oriented romantic perfectionism are negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction. Self-oriented perfectionism and other-oriented romantic perfectionism refer to the tendencies (in a romantic relationship) to set excessively high standards for oneself and one’s partner, respectively. The psychological process underlying these two types of perfectionism and the effect of those processes on the individual warrant consideration. Romantic perfectionism tends to provide individuals with a unique internal working model (IWM) and cognitive process that may affect their perception of external situational information. Consideration of whether romantic perfectionism affects a couple’s perceptions of interpersonal behavior, thereby predicting relationship satisfaction, is also necessary. On the basis of past research, perfectionism can be divided into two types, namely a general perfectionist trait and a domain-specific perfectionism. Discussions on the general trait of perfectionism have emphasized that perfectionism is a universal personal trait that exists across contexts. Domain-specific perfectionism refers to a perfectionism that is focused on a particular domain, such as romantic relationships. Domain-specific perfectionism is a demonstration of personal traits in relational interaction and context. In summary, when measuring perfectionism, the distinct relationship and situation must be considered, presenting various connotations for the measurement. In the domain of a romantic relationship, the term “dyadic perfectionism” or “romantic perfectionism” is discussed. Each partner’s perceived interpersonal behavior may exert a c rucial role in determining the effect of romantic perfectionism on relationship quality. The IWM of perfectionism acquired from the parent–child attachment relationship during childhood provides the individual with a unique cognitive process with which to perceive the couple’s interpersonal behavior. This study uses the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) model to assess perceptions of partners´ interpersonal behavior in romantic relationships, including affirmations of autonomy, care for the affiliation, ignorance of personal attacks, and assuming control. The SASB model holds that interpersonal behavior can be divided into two dimensions: affiliation and interdependence. Affiliation refers to the two opposing behaviors of love and hate and emphasizes the need for individuals to maintain proximity in the dynamics of interpersonal behavior. Interdependence refers to the two opposing behaviors of control and autonomy, emphasizing the individual´s desire for autonomy and self-worth. The purpose of this study was to explore whether the perceptions of a partner´s interpersonal behavior have a mediating effect on the association between romantic perfectionism and relationship satisfaction. To do so, we developed the following hypotheses. Hypothesis 1-1 : Other-oriented perfectionism would have a negative association with relationship satisfaction.Hypothesis 1-2: Self-oriented perfectionism would have a negative association with relationship satisfaction.Hypothesis 2: Perception of a partner´s interpersonal behavior would have a mediating effect on the correlation between romantic perfectionism and relationship satisfaction.The research objects were heterosexual college students in Taiwan who reported being in a romantic relationship. A total of 440 valid questionnaires were collected from 62 men (14.1%) and 378 women (85.9%); the average age of the participants was 22.51 years and the average relationship duration was 22.8 months. In the questionnaire issued to the participants, the Romantic Relationship Perfectionism Scale (Chinese version), Perception of Partner´s Interpersonal Behavior Scale, and Relationship Assessment Scale were applied. The following four research conclusions were drawn. First, in the association of relationship satisfaction with romantic perfectionism, perception of partner’s interpersonal behaviors, such as affirmations of autonomy and care for the affiliation, had mediating effects. The results also revealed that in the cases of both self-oriented or other-oriented perfectionism, individuals who perceive less interpersonal behaviors such as affirmations of autonomy and care for the affiliation in their partner experience less satisfaction in the romantic relationship. Both self-oriented or partner-oriented romantic perfectionism makes perceiving positive interpersonal behaviors in a partner more difficult. However, romantic perfectionism may make individuals more sensitive to interpersonal behaviors such as whether they are loved and whether the partner provides them with autonomy and an emotional connection. Second, in romantic relationships, investigating the perception of interpersonal behavior is crucial. Such perceptions may be influenced by romantic perfectionism, which can cause individuals to overlook positive interpersonal behaviors. Specifically, other-oriented perfectionism can make individuals more sensitive to the partner’s personal attacks. The evaluation of how partners perceive each other’s interpersonal behavior may be crucial in couples therapy. Third, self-oriented and other-oriented perfectionism may differ in their effects on perceptions of interpersonal behavior. Both types of perfectionism can make individuals less likely to perceive their partner’s affirmations of autonomy and care for the affiliation and are associated with lower relationship satisfaction. Other-oriented perfectionism is also associated with lower relationship satisfaction, and perceptions of partners’ interpersonal behavior (e.g., ignoring personal attacks) have a mediating effect on the association between romantic perfectionism and relationship satisfaction. Both other-oriented and self-oriented perfectionism can promote unique perceptions of partners’ interpersonal behavior among individuals involved in romantic relationships. However, the psychological function of other-oriented perfectionism may differ from that of self-oriented perfectionism. Other-oriented romantic perfectionism is more likely to make an individual more sensitive to personal attacks from the partner, which is associated with lower relationship satisfaction. This suggests that the psychological function of selforiented romantic perfectionism prompts individuals to care more about whether they are loved. By contrast, the psychological function of other-oriented perfectionism in romantic relationships prompts individuals to care about not only whether they are loved but also whether they are being harmed. Finally, other-oriented romantic perfectionism may have a more noteworthy influence on romantic relationships. This study has several limitations that warrant discussion. Most previous studies on romantic perfectionism have reported that other-oriented perfectionism is negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction or quality, and the results of the present study support this. However, in the present study, we discovered a minor negative correlation between self-oriented perfectionism and relationship satisfaction. We also demonstrated that compared with self-oriented perfectionism, other-oriented perfectionism may have a stronger association with relationship satisfaction. Previous studies on the influence of perfectionism on romantic relationships have often reported inconsistent results. Some studies have demonstrated a negative correlation between self-oriented perfectionism and relationship quality or relationship satisfaction, whereas other studies have indicated no significant correlation, or even a positive correlation, between self-oriented perfectionism and relationship quality or satisfaction,. The most likely reason for these inconsistencies is that these studies did not investigate a domain-specific perfectionism and seldom used romantic relationships as the measurement context. When selforiented perfectionism is measured in domain-specific perfectionism, its influence on relationship satisfaction may be less than that of other-oriented perfectionism. This also indicates that other-oriented perfectionism may have a more notable influence on relationships generally. The results of this research may be useful in couples therapy or emotional education. Assessment of the influence of perfectionism on partners engaged in a romantic relationship suggests that individuals with excessively strict perfectionism requirements or expectations for their partners must undergo an adjustment that can help them develop a more intimate relationship. Romantic perfectionism has a unique IWM, with such perfectionism affecting how individuals perceive their partners’ interpersonal behavior. Excessive expectations and requirements of a partner may make an individual overlook the partner´s positive interpersonal behaviors and focus on their negative behaviors. Thus, such individuals cause their own suffering while in love. We hope that more studies exploring the influence of romantic perfectionism and partners´ perceived interpersonal behavior in romantic relationships will be conducted in the future.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2939,53.3,2022,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Use of Electronic Products by Taiwanese Children and Their Effect on Children’s Development: Applying Data from Kids in Taiwan Study,"Ching Yang, Chien-Ju Chang","child development, early childhood, Kids in Taiwan, media usage","Electronic products, such as televisions, smartphones, tablets, and computers, have become an integral part of our lives. Not only are these items increasingly popular but they have also changed our daily routines and communication habits. The Common Sense census (Rideout, 2017) in the United States revealed that more than 90% of children had at least one electronic product at home. In Taiwan, Wei and Chuang (2016) sampled 876 preschool children, revealing that more than 90% were exposed to electronic products and approximately 10% had started to use electronic products before the age of 2. The effect of electronic product use on children’s development is a concern for parents, teachers, and researchers in the field of early childhood education. However, studies on the relationship between electronic product use and children’s development have produced mixed results. This study investigated (1) the use of electronic products by 3-year-old children in Taiwan, (2) whether children from different backgrounds spent different amounts of time using electronic products, and (3) how children’s usage of electronic product influences their motor, language, cognitive-attention/executive function, and emotional development.The participants in this study were 2,164 children born in Taiwan between April 1, 2013 and March 31, 2014, comprising 1,113 boys (51.4%) and 1,051 girls (48.6%). The age range of the parents in the sample was predominantly 31–40 years (59.7% of fathers, 69.8% of mothers), followed by 41–50 years (31.1% of fathers, 15.9% of mothers). This study used the Physical Movement Development Questionnaire, Language Development Questionnaire, Cognitive Development Questionnaire (Attention/Executive Function), Social Emotional Development Questionnaire, and Electronic Product Use Questionnaire developed by the Kids in Taiwan: National, Longitudinal Study of Child Development and Care project (Chang, 2019) to collect the data. The SPSS and AMOS software programs were used to perform descriptive and inferential statistics and structural equation model analyses, respectively. Seven main results were obtained from this study:(1) Only 6.8% of the children had never used electronic products. Television was the most frequently used electronic product (78%), followed by smartphones (64.8%); the least used were video game consoles (2.8%) and notebook computers (4.1%).(2) Children spent more time watching television than using other electronic products daily. On average, more than half the children (57.3%) watched television within 1.5 hours per day, and 24.8% watched television for more than 2 hours per day. More than 70% used smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and video game consoles within 1 hour.(3) The average time boys and girls spent watching television was 102 minutes and 90 minutes, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant. No significant difference, however, was identified for the time spent using smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, or video game consoles between boys and girls.(4) In this study, the children’s places of residence were divided into “northern,” “central,” “southern,” and “eastern.” The results demonstrated that no significant difference existed in the time children spent watching television in terms of place of residence (F = 1.47, p > .05), but a significant difference was observed in the time children spent using smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and video games with regard to place of residence (F = 6.34, p < .001). Children living in central (M = 45.76) and southern Taiwan (M = 47.17) spent significantly more time using smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and video games than those living in northern Taiwan (M = 37.53).(5) A significant difference was identified in time spent watching television and using smartphones, tablets, notebook computers, and video games in relation to parents’ education levels. Children whose parents had not completed high school (M= 112.37) watched television and used smartphones, tablets, computers, and video games for significantly longer periods than those whose parents had graduated from university or college (M = 93.89) or held a master’s degree or above (M = 65.63).(6) Children with different household incomes spent different lengths of time watching television and using smartphones, tablets, computers, and video games. Children with a monthly household income under NT$40,000 spent significantly more time watching television than those whose monthly family income ranged from NT$70,000 to NT$120,000 or was NT$120,000 and above; children with a monthly family income between NT$40,000 and NT$70,000 watched television significantly more than those whose monthly household income was between NT$70,000 and NT$120,000 or NT$120,000 and above. In addition, children with a monthly household income under NT$40,000 used smartphones, tablets, computers, and video games the longest.(7) In terms of children’s development, this study found that the children who spent the most time watching television (r = -.107, p < .01) and using smartphones, tablets, computers, and video games (r = -.095, p < .01) had a significantly lower level of fine motor development. A similar result was identified for language development. The correlation coefficients for the relationship between children’s time spent watching television and their performance in receptive language, productive language, and emergent literacy were -.043 (p < .05), -.130 (p < .01), and -.138 (p < .01), respectively. As for the relationship between the time children spent using smartphones, tablets, computers, and video games and the three constructs of children’s language development, the correlation coefficients all reached significant levels (receptive language: r = -.043, p < .05; productive language: r = -.136, p < .01; emergent literacy: r = -.130, p < .01). The results also demonstrated a significantly negative correlation between the time children spent watching television and their attention/executive function (r = -.129, p < .01). The same finding was evident in the relationship between the time children spent using smartphones, tablets, computers, and video games and their attention/executive function performance (r = -.100, p < .01). With respect to children’s emotional development, similar results were observed. Significantly negative relationships were identified between the time children spent watching television and children’s emotional awareness (r = -.062, p < .01), emotional expression (r = -.063, p < .01), and emotional understanding (r = -.063, p < .01). The results of the structural equation model analyses demonstrated that children’s socioeconomic status (SES) could explain the time children spent using electronic products; the higher a child’s SES was, the less time they spent using these products. The time children spent using electronic products was also linked to their level of development; the longer a child spent using these products, the worse their developmental level was. SES did not have a direct influence on children’s development.In conclusion, this study extended previous research and revealed that the electronic products used most frequently by 3-year-old children in Taiwan were televisions and smartphones and the average time children spent watching television was higher than that recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. Significant differences were observed in the time children spent using electronic products when children’s gender, parental education level, family income, and place of residence were analyzed. Significant negative relationships were also revealed between the time children spent using electronic products and their motor, language, cognitive, and emotional development, which is consistent with previous studies. The results of this study suggest that the prolonged use of electronic products has a negative impact on the development of 3-year-old children in Taiwan. Parents, caregivers, and educators should pay more attention to the time children spend using these products.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2920,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Validation of a Diagnostic Assessment of Chinese Competence System,"Yi-Hsuan Lee, Yeh-Tai Chou, Yao-Ting Sung","reading comprehension, computerized adaptive testing, diagnosis, Chinese reading ability","Reading comprehension is essential for learning in all subjects and for lifelong learning; it is also a crucial ability allowing people to communicate and interact with one another. Therefore, large-scale international assessments such as the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study and Program for International Student Assessment incorporate reading as an indicator of learning outcomes. This study also recognizes the essential nature of reading comprehension.However, existing reading comprehension tests have several limitations. For example, the target populations of most tests comprise students in specific grades (e.g., elementary school students) or groups (e.g., students with special needs), and the assessments involve paper-and-pencil tests with fixed items that requires a lot of resources on test implementation and scoring. Currently, no Chinese reading comprehension assessment suitable for long-term implementation in general classrooms exists. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to develop an assessment system, namely the Diagnostic Assessment of Chinese Competence (DACC), for comprehensively evaluating students’ reading abilities in the form of a computerized adaptive test. The reliability and validity of this system were also verified.The DACC system holistically assesses students’ reading comprehension and assesses student performance in reading subskills such as comprehension (e.g., lexical, literal, and inferential), contextual integration, and analysis and evaluation. This assessment system was designed for students from the 2nd grade to the 12th grade.The DACC test items were drafted by school teachers, doctoral students in psychology, and professionals engaged in research on the Chinese language. All drafters were required to attend and pass training before contributing test items to the DACC system. Item topics were selected to be familiar to students, such as topics relating to daily or school life. The topics are not limited to the language arts, covering life experience, history, geography, and science. In the proposed system, assessment texts appear in various formats, including continuous texts, noncontinuous texts, mixed texts, multiple texts, and texts displayed in hypertext. Text styles are also varied and include texts written in narrative, expository, descriptive, and argumentative styles. This wide range of texts reflects real-world reading situations encountered by students in their lives. Most of the DACC items are testlets, with each of the questions in the testlet corresponding to one of the five dimensions including vocabulary, literal comprehension, contextual integration, inferential comprehension, and analysis and evaluation. Such a design measures student performance in each of the dimensions and results in a comprehensive analysis of their reading abilities upon completion of the DACC.All test items were subjected to pilot tests to collect actual responses from students for the purpose of observing whether the questions meet the proposed design. The responses were also used to estimate item parameters. All DACC items were vertically equated on the basis of the nonequivalent groups with anchor test design. In the pilot tests, the characteristics of the respondents were also considered. Stratified random sampling was adopted to recruit students from both urban and rural areas to ensure that the parameter estimation results for the items apply to all students in the population. The DACC items were dichotomously scored in the pilot tests. At least 300 responses were gathered for each test item, and both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) were applied to analyze the responses. In the IRT-based analysis, this study used the multidimensional random coefficients multinomial logit model (MRCMLM) with marginal maximum likelihood estimation to estimate item parameters and used expected a posteriori measures to estimate ability parameters. In the CTT-based analysis, the pass rates and item discrimination were calculated for each item.To screen the DACC items for favorable psychometric characteristics, this study adopted two indicators. In the IRT-based analysis, the information-weighted mean square fit statistic (infit MNSQ) was used as the indicator to rule out misfit items, and items with infit MNSQ values between 0.6 and 1.4 were retained. In the CTT-based analysis, item discrimination was used as the indicator. Test items with discrimination of .3 or higher were retained. Accordingly, only when test items that met the requirements for both of these two indicators were entered into the formal item bank of the DACC system, resulting in 1019 items in this bank after data analysis. The range of item difficulties are bigger than -2 to 2, which corresponds to the ability parameters that include most students. The screening also demonstrated that the DACC is suitable for assessing the reading comprehension skills of students from the 2nd to 12th grades.To strengthen the effectiveness of the DACC system, this study constructed an assessment system based on computerized adaptive testing. For estimation of abilities, maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) was used. For test item selection, Fisher’s information was applied to calculate the item information each time students finished answering a set of questions. The system then randomly assigned the next question from the five items with the highest information score. When the number of items answered met a previously set standard, the assessment was terminated.Furthermore, this study provided a set of reference norms for the students’ test results. A total of 38,099 students from 1,255 schools in Taiwan were included in the study. For these students, average scores were calculated for the students in each grade through the DACC system. Thus, students completing the assessment could compare their results against the norm and understand the level of their performance on the test. Such a reference can provide clear and objective standards to assist DACC users in assessing the grade level of their reading abilities. Accordingly, teachers can both determine whether their students’ reading abilities meet the required level and adjust their follow-up instruction based on the assessment results.In addition to the rigorous procedures for constructing the DACC assessment system, this study examined the reliability and validity of the system. For the test-retest reliability assessment, this study evaluated the scores of 1,449 students who completed the test twice; the evaluation results revealed that the average correlation of their two scores was .76, meaning that the DACC system has high reliability. In the IRT analysis, the conditional reliability of the DACC system was also high. Assessing the test results of 16,479 students revealed that the average reliability of the system was above .80, indicating that the DACC system has a stable and high reliability level for students of differing reading abilities. The validity of the assessment system was examined on the basis of criterion-related validity. Assessing the scores of 2,332 ninth-grade students who underwent both the DACC and the Comprehensive Assessment Program for Junior High School Students (a large-scale standardized test that all graduates of junior high school in Taiwan must complete) indicated that the correlation of the scores from the two tests was moderate ( .64). Moreover, construct validity assessment results demonstrated that all DACC items fit the MRCMLM.In summary, this study adopted a series of rigorous procedures to construct a DACC assessment system; the reliability and validity of the DACC were also verified. IRT was utilized to analyze item parameters to determine difficulty levels and student ability levels. Additionally, an item bank and ability norms were established for the system, thus enabling the use of a computerized adaptive test for assessment, which can effectively determine reading comprehension levels and provide longterm tracking of reading ability growth trends. Results of test-retest reliability, conditional reliability, criterion validity, and IRT validity tests indicate that the DACC system provides a stable and effective assessment of student reading ability. For future studies, the DACC system’s item bank will be expanded. A control mechanism for the item exposure rate can also be adopted to improve the system’s effectiveness. Moreover, as a comprehensive assessment tool across multiple learning stages, the DACC system can provide empirical evidence for use in solving problems related to reading comprehension and make substantial contributions to related fields of research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2923,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Extended Angoff Method in Setting Standards for Self- Report Measures With Supplementary Performance- Level Descriptors,Jin-Chang Hsieh,"extended Angoff method, self-report measure, supplementary performance-level descriptors, standard setting, Taiwan Assessment of Student Achievement: Longitudinal Study","One vision of the 12-Year Basic Education Curriculum in Taiwan is to promote the comprehensive learning and development of all students. To ensure the quality of this curriculum reform, the Ministry of Education funded a long-term project, the Taiwan Assessment of Student Achievement: Longitudinal Study (TASAL), to evaluate the impact of the curriculum on student performance. The TASAL is a large-scale standards-based assessment, and standard setting is one of its main task. A comprehensive literature review indicated that most empirical studies related to standard setting have focused on cognitive domains and few study undertake expert-oriented standard-setting processes in affective domains because of some practical limitations. The present study suggests a new approach, employing supplementary performance-level descriptors (S-PLDs) in an extended Angoff method in setting standards for self-report measures. The purpose of this study was to uncover evidence of the procedural, internal, and external validity of implementing an extended Angoff method procedure with S-PLDs in standard setting for English comprehension strategy use among seventh grade students in Taiwan.PLDs are designed to outline the knowledge, skills, and practices that indicate the level of student performance in a target domain. In the present study, the use of comprehension strategies for learning English as a foreign language was examined. S-PLDs provide comparable but unique functions within the standard-setting process. S-PLDs offer supplementary material to subject matter experts to facilitate the formation of profiles of student performance in target domains, especially when ambiguities in conventional PLDs may prevent expert consensus during the standard-setting process.In this study, stratified two-stage cluster sampling was adopted to select representative seventh graders in Taiwan during the 2018–2019 academic year. After sampling, 7,246 students had been selected ; only 2,732 students, 1,417 boys and 1,315 girls, received an English comprehension strategy use questionnaire and English proficiency test. Student performance on both measurement instruments was the basis for writing PLDs and S-PLDs. The scale measuring English comprehension strategy use was a 4-point discrete visual analogue scale self-report measure developed through standardized procedures and comprises four dimensions: memorization (6 items), cognition (6 items), inference (8 items), and comprehension monitoring (10 items) strategies. The results of four-dimensional confirmatory factor analysis indicated a favorable model–data fit, except for the chisquare value, which was affected by the large sample size . Moreover, the English proficiency test used was a cognitive measure assessing students’ listening and reading comprehension abilities through the use of multiple-choice and constructed-response items. A total of 182 items were developed through a standardized procedure and divided into 13 blocks to assemble 26 test booklets. Each booklet, containing 28 items, was randomly delivered to a participating student; each student completed only one booklet. After data cleansing and item calibration with a multidimensional random coefficient multinomial logit model and the Test Analysis M odules (Robitzsch et al., 2020), the information-weighted fit mean-square indices for all test items ranged from 0.79 to 1.37, meeting the criterion proposed by Linacre (2005).An expert-oriented standard-setting meeting was hosted on May 20, 2020, after advanced materials, such as agenda, instruction of standard-setting method, had been sent to all experts. Eight experts from across Taiwan were invited to join the meeting, and they all had experience involving standard-setting meetings for student performance on English proficiency tests. The average number of years of teaching experience for these experts was 18.75, and seven had experience in teaching low achievers. Overall, the experts had sufficient prerequisite knowledge and experience with standard-setting processes. On the day of the standard-setting meeting, a series of events, including orientation, training and practice, and three rounds of extended Angoff standard-setting methods with different types of feedback provided between rounds, were undertaken. Feedback questionnaires were developed , and discussions among the experts between the rounds were recorded and analyzed as evidence of procedural and internal validity.Most of the subject matter experts were satisfied with the events during the standard-setting process and agreed that they could set satisfactory cutoff scores for future usage. From the results of feedback questionnaires completed between rounds, the experts nearly unanimously agreed that the materials received in advance; the introductions to PLDs, S-PLDs, and the extended Angoff method; and previous experience in setting standards for English proficiency were beneficial in judging items during the process. Additionally, the experts agreed that the S-PLDs played a key role in facilitating the formation of outlines for student performance in comprehension strategy use across different levels. All of these results indicate procedural validity.For evidence of internal validity, classification error (the ratio of the standard error of the passing score to the measurement error), was computed to indicate the consistency of the item ratings between and within the experts during the three-round process. Between experts and across rounds, the classification error ranged from 0.08 to 0.36 for memorization strategies, 0.14 to 0.49 for cognition strategies , 0.19 to 0.61 for inference strategies, and 0.24 to 0.72 for comprehension monitoring strategies. These results indicate that the cognitive levels for the four dimensions affect the consistency of item rating. Strategies with more abstract item content tended to have higher classification error. Furthermore, the lowest classification error values occurred in the second round for memorization and inference strategies and in the third round for cognition and comprehension monitoring strategies. All low values for each dimension were beneath the cutoff of 0.33 proposed by Kaftandjieva (2010), except for the value of 0.37 for comprehension monitoring strategystrategies. Regarding the rating consistency within experts between rounds, the results showed no extreme classification error, and most of the values were beneath 0.33, with the exceptions of 0.35 for cognition strategies and 0.37, 0.42, and 0.61 for comprehension monitoring strategies. Therefore, most experts exhibited rating consistency between the rounds. Additionally, the results of a content analysis of the item rating discussions indicated that three reference sources might affect experts’ judgments regarding the items: (1) students’ actual performance, (2) PLDs and S-PLDs, and (3) experts’ personal expectations. For example, one expert might give a lower score because his students tend to exhibit poor performance on a particular item dependent on their teaching experience, whereas another expert might give a higher score because of their personal expectations.To examine external validity, student performance on English proficiency tests was adopted as an external criterion. With two cutoff scores used to divide students into basic, proficient, and advanced users in each dimension, a medium effect size was obtained for memorization strategies, and large effect sizes were obtained for cognition, inference, and comprehension monitoring strategies. Furthermore, to compare the final cutoff scores obtained through the study method with existing methods , the study adopted the concept from TIMSS and PIRLS for setting standards for affective domains (Martin et al., 2014, p. 308). The classification accuracy indices, which indicate the proportions of students classified identically, were 90.25%, 81.20%, 82.52%, and 87.56% for the four dimensions. To sum up, the present study obtained satisfactory evidence of the procedural, internal, and external validity of using an extended Angoff procedure for setting standards for self-report measures with S-PLDs; additional suggestions are presented herein.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2921,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationship among the Will to Meaning, Flow, and Psychological Well-Being of Cross-Strait College Students: An Analysis of Mediating Effects and Multiple Groups","Jin-Long Liang, Chin-Deng Yang, Xin-Ling Cui, Ho-Tang Wu","flow, psychological well-being, will to meaning","This study analyzed (1) the relationship among the will to meaning, flow, and psychological well-being in Cross-strait college students; (2) the mediating effects of flow on the relationship between the will to meaning and psychological well-being; and (3) the moderating effects of Cross-strait college students. The conclusions of this study can serve as a reference in the practice and study of improving the will to meaning, flow, and psychological well-being among Cross-strait college students.According to the literature, the will to meaning influences psychological well-being and flow, which also affects psychological well-being. Therefore, the following three hypotheses were proposed:H1: The will to meaning and psychological well-being would be positively correlated in Cross-strait college students.H2: The will to meaning and flow would be positively correlated in Cross-strait college students.H3: Flow and psychological well-being would be positively correlated in Cross-strait college students.The analysis of the literature also indicated that flow plays a mediating role in the relationship between the will to meaning and psychological well-being in Cross-strait college students because, according to the core tenet of logotherapy, people can freely choose the meaning of their life, and people are driven by the will to meaning. The meaning of life comprises the pursuit of meaning. Therefore, people fully devote themselves to their pursued goal, which may concern academics, a career, family, or the committed pursuit of anything that improves their spirits. Regardless of the nature of the goal, it psychologically produces a peak or optimal experience; this is the perception of flow, and the will to meaning can advance the perception of flow. When in a state of heightened flow, an individual is fully engaged in an activity or work and is likely to feel a sense of accomplishment. This is consistent with the perception of psychological well-being, which is based on the theory of eudaimonia. This indicates that flow can increase the perception of psychological well-being. Therefore, H4 was proposed as follows: Flow would have a mediating effect on the relationship between the will to meaning and psychological well-being in Cross-strait college students.Some related studies have indicated that differences in politics, economics, education, cultural awareness, ideas, and value orientation have produced disparate social and cultural environments on each side of the Taiwan Strait. Therefore, Cross-strait college students perceptions of the will to meaning, flow, and psychological well-being may also contrast. Therefore, H5 was proposed as follows: The relationships among the will to meaning, flow, and psychological well-being in Cross-strait college students would have moderating effects.The hypotheses were verified using the following measures:1. Research participants. Cross-strait college students were surveyed using paper-based questionnaires. In total, 1401 questionnaires were collected—701 and 700 questionnaires from Cross-strait respondents, respectively. A total of 972 (69.4%) responses were from female and 429 (30.6%) were from male students.2. Research tools. The tools used in this study were the Taiwan College Students’ Sense of Life Meaning Scale by Wu et al. (2015), the flow domain of the Positive Emotion Scale for College Students by Hou et al. (2012), and the Psychological Well-Being Scale for College Students in Taiwan by Wu et al. (2015). The three scales have theoretical bases and favorable reliability and validity. All three scales were pretested on Taiwanese university students only; thus, we resampled and pretested the scales with Cross-strait college students. Confirmatory factor analysis was also conducted on samples of Cross-strait college students (200 each; N = 400) for pretesting; the results indicated that the instruments had an acceptable overall model fit, preliminary fit criteria, and fit of internal structure model.3. Hypothesis models and data analysis. On the basis of the literature review, mediating and multigroup hypothesis models were proposed. The mediating model verified whether the will to meaning influenced psychological well-being through flow among Cross-strait college students. On the basis of the mediating effects model, the multigroup analysis compared the Crossstrait college students to verify whether the three paths, namely will to meaning–flow, flow–psychological well-being, and will to meaning–psychological well-being, had moderating effects. The hypothetical models of the mediating and multigroup models were initially analyzed using AMOS 24.0, but we determined that the multivariate value shows that the variables were not normally distributed (t = 42.819, p < .001). Therefore, in consideration of the extent of variations, we replaced AMOS 24.0 with Smart PLS 3.0 because it uses partial least squares, the smallest flat method of analysis.First, the responses to the questionnaires were first for common method variance through an unmeasured latent method construct. No significant common method variance was detected. Second, in the mediating and model analyses, according to the propositions of Baron and Kenny (1986), the prerequisites of the mediating effects were as follows: (1) the independent variable can explain the dependent variable (i.e., will to meaning affects psychological well-being); (2) the independent variable can explain the mediating variable (i.e., will to meaning affects flow); and (3) the mediating variable can explain the dependent variable (i.e., flow affects psychological well-being). The mediation model was analyzed only after these three conditions were satisfied. Having confirmed that all three conditions were met, we examined the mediating model.In terms of model fit for mediation, the factor loading, composite reliability, average variance extracted, and discriminant validity all met the criteria and demonstrated the appropriateness of the measurement (outer) model. Second, the collinearity, R2, f 2, and Q2 all conformed to the standard inner mode, meaning that the structural pattern was also appropriate. Positive correlations were determined between the will to meaning and psychological well-being, will to meaning and flow, and flow and psychological well-being among the Cross-strait college students; thus, H1, H2, and H3 were supported.Third, variance accounted for (VAF), which is the indirect effect divided by total effect, of the mediating effects was 47.30%. Hair et al. (2016) proposed that a VAF of > 80%, 20%–80%, and < 20% indicate full mediation, partial mediation, and no mediation, respectively. According to this standard, flow partially mediated the relationship between the will to meaning and psychological well-being and had statistical power. Therefore, H4 was supported.Fourth, the multigroup model analysis results indicated that the students’ locations had no moderating effect on the flow→psychological well-being and will to meaning–psychological well-being paths but did have a moderating effect on the will to meaning–flow path. The path coefficients were 0.683 for the Mainland China students and 0.611 for the Taiwanese students, indicating that the will to meaning and flow had a significantly stronger correlation among the Mainland China students than among the Taiwanese students. As such, H5, which predicted moderating effects on the relationships among the will to meaning, flow, and psychological well-being in Cross-strait college students, was partially supported.According to the analysis results, the following four suggestions are proposed: (1) university students’ will to meaning should be increased; (2) university students should improve their own flow; (3) the mediating factors between the will to meaning and psychological well-being should be reexamined; and (4) future studies should investigate moderating factors between cross-strait college students in greater depth.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2924,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Associations between Parental Psychological Control and Social Anxiety in Emerging Adulthood: The Mediating Role of Differentiation of Self,"Chia-Mei Lian, Chih-Wen Wu, Ching-Ling Cheng","parental psychological control, differentiation of self, emerging adulthood, social anxiety","The theory of parent-child interaction implies that through repeated and close parent-child interactions, children acquire social-behavioral orientations that extend into their interpersonal relationships (Patterson, 2002). Recently, the topic of parental psychological control has received much attention in Taiwan. Parental psychological control is defined as the presence of parenting behaviors that intrude on children’s emotional and psychological autonomy (Barber, 1996) and are manipulative and intrusive to children’s thoughts and feelings, such as withdrawing one’s love or inducing guilt; such parenting can be predictive of numerous types of psychological maladaptation in children (Barber & Harmon, 2002). Research has indicated that psychologically controlling parental behavior may be linked to internalizing problems, such as higher levels of anxiety (Nanda et al., 2012; Seibel & Johnson, 2001) and lower levels of social consciousness (Baumrind, 1991), in children. Additionally, parental behavior of psychological control may enmesh children into the parents’ psychological worlds, may encourage dependency in children, and may inhibit individuation by infantilizing children (Barber & Harmon, 2002). Emerging adulthood is a developmental stage when young people are experimenting with various approaches to living and gradually moving toward making decisions with long-lasting implications (Arnett, 2000). Self-differentiation is a crucial developmental task in emerging adulthood. According to Erikson’s (1968) psychosocial developmental theory, emerging adults must simultaneously cope with the challenges of constructing stable self-identities and developing intimate relationships with others. Parental psychological control that inhibits individual discovery and expression may be negatively linked to poor ego development and even social maladaptation (Barber & Harmon, 2002). Thus, investigators should investigate how parental psychological control interferes with the emerging adult’s progress in establishing a stable identity and maintaining good interpersonal relations with others.Therefore, this study aimed to examine the associations between parental psychological control and social anxiety and examine the mediating role of the differentiation of self during the stage of emerging adulthood. To further clarify the mediating mechanism of the differentiation of self, the mediating pathway of each dimension (i.e., emotional reactivity, I-position, emotional cutoff, fusion with family, and fusion with others) was examined separately in this study. Additionally, to account for gender effects, a stratified analysis by gender was conducted for whether parental psychological control differently affects social anxiety through the degree of self-differentiation in male versus female participants.The participants of this study comprised 955 emerging adults (364 men and 591 women) aged 18—25 years (mean age: 21.41 years). The measurement instruments used in this study were as follows: the Chinese version of the Parental Psychological Control Questionnaire (Cheng, 2014), the Social Anxiety Scale for Adolescents (Cheng & Chen, 2015), and the Differentiation of Self Inventory (Lam & Chan-So, 2015). These scales were internally consistent with Cronbach’s alpha coefficients >.70. The participants’ age distribution and the degree of their reliance on resources from their family indicated that they may be susceptible to indirect control by their parents. Therefore the variables of age, school attendance, financial dependence, and whether they lived with their parents were treated as control variables in this study. The study’s used structural equation modeling with the bootstrapping approach to examine the mediation effects of the five dimensions of the differentiation of self.The results demonstrated that parental psychological control positively predicted social anxiety in emerging adults. Differences were noted in the mediating effects of the five dimensions of the differentiation of self and the moderating role of gender. First, we revealed that the “emotional reactivity” and “fusion with others” aspects of self-differentiation had significant indirect effects and that these results did not significantly differ between male and female participants. Second, we found that the “I-position” aspect of self-differentiation had a significant indirect effect among female but not male participants. Lastly, we found that the “emotional cutoff” and “fusion with family” aspects of self-differentiation had no indirect effects in either male or female participants.The findings of the present study indicate that parental psychological control, with its characteristics of manipulation and enmeshment, harms the development of emotional abilities in emerging adults by making it difficult for these individuals to distinguish between the emotional and intellectual processes. Individuals who perceive more psychological control from their parents tend to have lower degrees of differentiation of self and feel anxiety in interpersonal relationships because they tend to reproduce the unresolved attachment emotions of their original family (Bowen, 1978). In addition, according to the internal working model theory, individuals may internalize experiences of being rejected by their parents. If parents frequently induce guilt in or withdraw love from their children, children may perceive themselves to be loved only conditionally. When children transfer this experience to social relationships, they may worry about others´ evaluations of them and attempt to ensure they meet the expectations of others. Such children are thus more likely to feel intense anxiety in social interactions. Furthermore, our findings indicate that women may be more likely than men to feel anxiety and guilt in the process of individualization in Chinese society (Tsai & Wu, 1998). Parental psychological control may thus restrict women from asserting their own principles and positions in interpersonal interactions, especially in high-pressure situations, and this may generate feelings of social anxiety that hinder their interpersonal relationships.Based on these findings, we demonstrated that examining the mediating role played by self-differentiation, and further exploring its individual dimension can contribute to our understanding of the links between parental psychological control and social anxiety in emerging adults. Additionally, further clarification of gender-specific effects in these associations are warranted. Most research in Western societies has viewed the construct of ""fusion with family"" as embedded in ""fusion with others."" Our findings, however, revealed the necessity of distinguishing between the dimensions of ""fusion with family"" and ""fusion with others"" when self-differentiation is investigated in Chinese society. The cultural emphasis of filial piety and collectivist values privileges the role of “family” in Chinese society and thus indicates that the aspect of ""fusion with family"" could be very different from the aspect of ""fusion with others."" Future research to explore the indigenous nature of the ""fusion with family"" dimension of self-differentiation prevalent in Chinese communities is recommended.A major limitation of this study was that all data were self-reported. Future research could collect data from diverse sources, such as collecting parental reports of psychological control in addition to child reports. Narrative research is also an alternative approach to examine how the effects of parental psychological control in emerging adults might generate and develop into unique narrative experiences in interpersonal relationships.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2925,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Power of Feedback Manipulations: Effects on Taiwanese Junior High School Students’ Expectancy- Value Beliefs and Academic Performance,Shu-Ling Peng,"academic performance, expectancy-value belief, feedback manipulation","The feedback given by teachers to students is one of the most important and frequent instructional practices in the classroom, which would affect the individual’s learning motivation, emotions, strategies, behavior and performance. The concept of feedback (i.e., evaluation) is conceived as information about a students’ performance on a leaning task or a test (Pekrun et al., 2014), which conveying different types of messages, such as performance improvement vs. relative performance (Butler, 1987; Steele-Johnson et al., 2008), success vs. failure feedback (Senko & Harackiewicz, 2005), temporal evaluation vs. normative evaluation (Butler, 2006), and self-referential feedback vs. normative feedback (Pekrun et al., 2014). So far, a number of studies have addressed which types of feedback students received after task engagement influences on their achievement goals and achievement-relevant outcomes (e.g., Butler, 1987, 2006; Pekrun et al. 2014; Senko & Harackiewicz, 2005). However, a few studies have examined the impact of multiple feedback on students’ learning motivations and outcomes except for the synthesize-referenced feedback (combining effects of normative and self-referential feedback) proposed by Ju and Lin (2011); in addition, the impact of feedback on both students’ expectancy and value belief has been neglected. Accordingly, based on the view of multiple goal on achievement goal theory (Pintrich, 2000), the expectancy-value theory (Eccles et al., 1983), and work by Ju and Lin, we proposed a framework linking different kinds of feedback to learning motivations and performance. More specifically, we addresses self-referential feedback based on student’s improvement of performance over time, normative feedback based on comparing a students’ performance with the performance of other students, and multiple-referential feedback based on the combined characteristics of the above two feedbacks. It posited that these kinds of feedback influence students’ expectancy-values beliefs and academic performance. These hypotheses were examined in a teaching experimental study with junior high school students. The aims of this study was to test the impacts of different kind of feedback instructions on Taiwanese junior high school seven-grade students’ expectancy-value beliefs and performance in the subject of civil ethics. Correspondingly, two research questions guided the study: (1) do different kinds of feedbacks given by teachers to students influence on their expectancy and value belief? (2) and academic performance? Moreover, which one have the most promotion effect on these beliefs and performance? For research question 1, we hypothesized that students who are given experimental manipulations will report holding higher level of learning motivation (both in terms of expectancy and value beliefs) compared to students who will not receive any feedback (i.e., control group). Among them, it is further posited that the group of multiple-referential feedback has the most effect on these belief; in addition, the expectancy and value belief held by control group will decline over time. For research question 2, we hypothesized that students who receive experimental manipulations will have better performance in the second and the third regular examinations respectively compared to control group after controlling for their performance of the first regular examination. Similarly, it is further posited that the group of multiple-referential feedback has the best effect on these performance. For expectancy-value beliefs, 4 (group) × 3 (measurement wave) two-way mixed experimental design is conducted. The first independent variable is group including four levels: self-referential feedback, normative feedback, multiple-referential feedback, and control group (no feedback) as the between-subject factor; the second independent variable is measurement waves including three measurements as the within-subject factor. Dependent variables are students’ expectancy-value beliefs including self-efficacy, interest, utility, and attainment. For performance, nonequivalent pretest-posttest-delay posttest design is conducted. The independent variables include group (including three manipulation groups and control group) and measurement wave (including three measurements); and dependent variables are students’ performances of the second and the third regular examinations. A convenience sample was involved. A total of 170 seven-grades Taiwanese junior high school students (60 females and 60 males at ages 13-14) from eight classes with 1 school in Tainan City voluntarily participated (upon written parental consent) in this study after the study was approved by the University Ethics Committee. The period of the teaching experiment executed was the first semester of the 107 academic year (from September 2018 to January 2019) including six sessions: firstly, all participants completed the first measurement instruments (including perceived teacher feedback and expectancy-value belief questionnaires) one week before the first regular examination; secondly, each experimental group received four manipulations via quizzes during the first to the second examinations; thirdly, all participants completed the second measurement instruments one week before the second regular examination; fourthly, each experimental group received one manipulations via the second regular examination; fifthly, each experimental group received four manipulations via quizzes during the second to the third examinations; finally, all participants completed the third measurement instruments one week before the third regular examination. The data of students’ expectancy-value beliefs and academic performance were collected respectively before and after the implementation of the three regular examinations. We used SPSS Statistics Version 17.0 for Windows in all the analyses. Firstly, we conducted a 4 × 3 two-way mixed ANOVA analysis for the first research question; and one-way ANCOVA for the second research question. On the whole, the results showed that the various types of feedback exerted different impacts on students’ expectancy-value belief and academic performance. For the first research question, results revealed that there were significant two-way interaction effects between groups and measurement waves on self-efficacy and attainment-and-utility. More specifically, the normative and multiple-referential feedback groups had a greater effect on students’ self-efficacy, and the scores of the two experimental groups in the third measurement were significantly higher than those in the first measurement and the control group; however, as hypothesized, students’ self-efficacy of control group in the third measurement was lower than that in the first measurement, implying that students’ self-efficacy of control group gradually declined over time. Moreover, the multiple-referential feedback had a positive influence on attainment-and-utility value. That is, students’ attainment-and-utility value were enhanced by multiple-referential feedback in the second measurement and its positive effect remained in the third measurement as the number of manipulations increased. However, as our expectation, students’ attainment-and-utility value among the other three groups gradually decreased over time. For the second research question, this study found that after excluding the students’ performance of the first regular examination, their performance of the second regular examination of self-referential feedback group was significantly higher than those of multiple-referential feedback group and the control group, but there was no difference from the normative feedback group. Nevertheless, with the increase of feedback manipulation time, students’ performance of the third regular examination among all the three experimental groups was significantly higher than that of control group, but differences were not found among the three experimental groups. What kind of feedback promotes students’ expectancy-value beliefs and academic performance? Results disclosed that different types of feedbacks exerts distinct impacts on students’ learning motivations and academic performance. Specifically, normative and multiple-referential feedbacks had the most effects on promoting students’ self-efficacy; multiple-referential feedback exerted the best promotion on students’ attainment-and-utility value; and all the three experimental groups had positive impacts on students’ academic performance. Results have theoretical and applied implications for understanding and improving feedback practices and students’ motivations and performance.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2926,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Applying Collaborative Action Research through MSE Infused Curriculum on Mathematics Remedial Teaching in Middle School Classroom,Yu-Ling Liu,"mathematics learning strategies, mathematics learning emotions, mediating effects, remedial teaching, Vico´s ideals","The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) results have revealed that students’ mathematics performance in Taiwan indicated a lack of student interest and a lack of student confidence and that students in Taiwan did not view skills in mathematics as valuable. Although high performance was noted in a substantial minority of the lowest performing students, the government launched many programs out of concern for disadvantaged and underperforming students, and these programs have been implemented for many years. After several years of efforts to conduct supplemental instruction for low-achieving students in mathematics (without satisfactory results), a new approach has emerged and is the fundamental theme of the present study, namely that teachers’ own beliefs about teaching are an important factor that influences the effectiveness of student learning. Empirical research has indicated that those teachers who contribute to effective student learning share similar teaching beliefs. Their teaching beliefs influence the relationship between learning techniques and culture and help students build on prior learning. Additionally, such teachers devise and present curricula that are relevant to students and that are aligned with their learning needs and cultures. The aim of this study is twofold. First, although teaching beliefs have been studied in detail in many contexts, this is the first study of aesthetic knowledge in remedial mathematics teaching.This study provides a crucial practical basis for remedial mathematics teaching in middle school classrooms. Second, the findings of this study should motivate future research in this area by providing a basis for action research. The paper is structured as follows. First, we briefly define Vico’s ideals and methods for transferring those ideals into the regular classroom. Second, our conceptual framework highlights how mathematics learning strategies and mathematics learning emotions influence motivational processes within student learning. Third, we present our conclusions resulting from this framework. Questions and implications for future research arising from the analyses then follow. Finally, we discuss how teachers can apply Vico’s ideals and MSE to actual classroom teaching. A central issue in this study is how teachers apply Vico’s ideals and MSE to actual classroom teaching. Providing teachers an opportunity to learn how to teach mathematics while engaging in authentic learning activities which combine both key mathematical and pedagogical concepts is one way to determine how teachers apply those concepts to their own teaching. According to recent studies, The New Science is the major work of Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico (1990), who posited that science without aesthetic knowledge results in a world devoid of imagination and creativity. Vico reasoned that without ontological knowledge of reality, the exact science of mathematics has limited insight into the creation of the objects in the world. Based this theory, we applied Vico’s ideals (1990) as key mathematics teaching concepts to guide the core values underlying the teaching of mathematics. Vico’s ideals contain three layers of aesthetic imagery: (1) the development of being to know the self and understand others, (2) the development of superior technical capabilities, and (3) the development of aesthetic performance skills. Vico’s ideals provide a path to transform teaching from the ideal to the realities of the regular classroom through the three S’s: the spiritual, the scientific, and storytelling; these are all conceptual teaching strategies that can support teachers and ensure effective learning for students. From 2013 to 2016, our research team constructed an MSE teaching module for supporting low-achieving students who were learning mathematics with the aid of a mathematics learning strategy (MS). Additionally, the module was designed to improve negative mathematics learning emotions and promote positive mathematics learning emotions (MEs). The question of how researchers and teachers can develop interventions in the mathematics classroom to address the learning needs of students . To achieve these purposes, we conducted collaborative action research focused on qualitative research methods and supplemented by quantitative research methods. To summarize, we focused on two classes and Vico’s ideals were applied to the optimization of one class, and MSE was applied to the optimization of the other class. Empirical research material was collected by combining different methods such as questionnaires, recorded interviews, video recordings of lessons in mathematics, and classroom observations. We used the Learning Strategy Scale and the Academic Emotion Scale for before and after testing. Qualitative data collection and analysis. The optimization process through Vico’s ideals was accomplished through the three S’s, comprising the spiritual, the scientific, and storytelling. First, a spiritual teaching task provided the opportunity for greater self-awareness through reflection and critical questioning in collaboration with research group members and the observing teacher. In addition, teaching-bydoing and learning-by-doing activities clarified that changes in teachers’ beliefs precede changes in their teaching practices. Second, in the scientific teaching task, the teacher changed the usual textbooks and paper-based evaluations to employ (1) group cooperation with tabletop games (Pagamo) and line and peer teaching to increase communicative opportunities for mathematics learning, (2) evaluation combined online platforms and multiple evaluation methodologies to cater to students with different learning needs. Third, the storytelling task used (1) digital technology to select the plot of a story, create a context, and provide examples of solving problems with mathematics and (2) anime cartoons from YouTube and story solitaire and test questions to increase student opportunities for using their mathematics knowledge. In the optimization process for the model of math self-concept, math learning strategies and math academic emotion (MSE), MSE´s infused teaching and teaching images guided teachers in the teaching of mathematics emotions by careful consideration of his or her own emotions before and after class. Students are highly impressionable and are seeking out role models whose actions they will adopt and mirror. Teachers should therefore attempt to lead by example and inspire students to perform at their best. In the MSE optimization class, students drew or wrote emotions notes to increase their awareness of their mathematics learning emotions and then shared these with others. The results revealed that, first, this program provided teachers with a variety of learning experiences and with an opportunity to reconsider the underlying assumptions of their approaches to teaching and may serve as a foundation to strengthen and facilitate communication between teachers and students. Awareness and reflection of issues that affected learning and professional development also increased. Second, the MSE program not only enhanced students’ mathematics learning strategies and awareness of mathematics emotions but also improved the personal growth of teachers. Third, collaborative action research helped teachers interpret the process of teacher inquiry and teaching optimization from Vico’s ideals and MSE teaching models and to implement and experience an optimized curriculum. Through Vico’s ideals and the 3 S’s, practical strategies were provided in different teaching contexts, offering teachers and students different learning experiences and allowing them to engage their imaginations and express their creativity.

Research on how an individual perceives knowledge began with Perry’s (1970) research on the longitudinal development of the ethical and intellectual development of Harvard University students in the United States, and the study of “epistemic cognition” in the field of educational psychology developed this concept further. Epistemic cognition is the exploration of how individuals think about, use, and understand the knowledge they possess. The term “approaches to learning” refers to the intention of learners when they encounter new content in learning situations and the learning strategies they adopt. Marton and Säljö’s (1976) exploration of the correlation between how Swedish college students read scientific papers and their learning outcomes opened up a new avenue for academic research on this theme. Learners who adopt a “deep approach” to learning do so because they want to understand their inner motivation for learning and thus exhibit a high level of engagement in the learning process. These learners use different learning strategies to link their previous learning experiences to their studies, thereby developing a system of structured knowledge. By contrast, learners who adopt a “surface approach” to learning are often compelled by extrinsic motivation. They are therefore less active learners, opting for the regurgitation over internalization of knowledge; thus, they are unable to develop a structured knowledge system. A teacher´s teaching concept influences the design of their teaching activities and their choice of teaching strategies, thereby affecting their teaching effectiveness. Teachers who adopt the concept of constructivist teaching consider the main purpose of teaching to be the establishment of an appropriate learning environment that supports students in the active development of knowledge. In such a classroom, the task of students is to play a role similar to that of a scientist and to construct knowledge using exploratory methods of their own. By contrast, teachers who adhere to traditional teaching concepts consider the purpose of teaching to be the transfer of knowledge to students. The task of students in this type of classroom is to absorb the knowledge passed on by their teacher. According to Kang (2008), teachers and students who believe that knowledge is certain and should be passed on by authority figures tend to advocate for teaching concepts of traditional pedagogy. Chan (2003) discovered that those with innate abilities tend to adopt a surface learning approach whereas those who learn assiduously are inclined to adopt a deep learning approach. Baeten et al. (2016) reported that the scores of those who use deep learning approaches are significantly and positively correlated with the scores obtained using student-centered teaching concepts. On the basis of the preceding literature review, this study proposed the following three hypotheses: H1: The epistemic cognition of elementary preservice teachers would exert a significant influence on their teaching concepts. H2: The epistemic cognition of elementary preservice teachers would exert a significant influence on their approaches to learning. H3: The epistemic cognition of elementary preservice teachers would exert a mediating effect on teaching concepts through approaches to learning. This study analyzed 201 valid responses to a pretest and 581 valid responses to a the questionnaire test proper. Four research instruments that all had 5-point Likert scales were used in this study: The Epistemic Cognition Scale, Deep Learning Approach Scale, Surface Learning Approach Scale, and Constructivist Teaching Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed on all four scales to test the construct validity, and the reliability of each scale was tested using Cronbach α coefficients. The α coefficients obtained for the four subscales of the Epistemic Cognition Scale were between .64 and .76, those for the four subscales of the Deep Learning Approach Scale were between .60 and .73, those for the four subscales of the Surface Learning Approach Scale were between .66 and .92, and those for the two subscales of the Constructivist Teaching Scale were both .86. The reliability and validity tests of the four scales thus had good reliability and validity. In this study, mediation was tested for using structural equation modeling in MPLUS 8.4 statistical software. The results supported H1 and H2 but not H3. The results reveal that the epistemic cognition of elementary preservice teachers directly affects their conception of constructivist teaching. Thus, when the epistemic cognition of preservice teachers leans toward a diverse view of knowledge and when the teachers believe that individuals can construct knowledge on their own, they tend to adopt a constructivist teaching approach, which is student centered. The epistemic cognition of elementary preservice teachers directly affects their approach to learning. Therefore, these teachers tend to adopt deep learning approaches that connect new knowledge to past experiences. However, when the epistemic cognition of preservice teachers tends toward the view that knowledge comes with binary right–wrong answers and is transmitted by authority, teachers tend to adopt surface learning approaches, which involve regurgitation. The results of this study also indicate that the epistemic cognition of elementary preservice teachers affects their approach to learning and constructivist teaching concepts, and if elementary preservice teachers know how to adopt a deep learning approach, they are better able to form a constructivist conception of teaching. Elementary preservice teachers become elementary school teachers, and the epistemic cognition of elementary school teachers not only affects their own approach to learning and teaching concepts but also the epistemic cognition of their students. Therefore, teacher-training institutions should pay more attention to the development of elementary preservice teachers’ epistemic cognition, approaches to learning, and concepts of teaching. According to the literature, elementary preservice teachers’ epistemic cognition tends toward multiple constructions and the belief that knowledge can be constructed by learners themselves. They tend to adopt deep learning and constructivist approaches, which are beneficial to knowledge construction. Therefore, their approach to learning mediates between epistemic cognition and the concepts of teaching. However, the results of this study reveal that the mediating effect of elementary preservice teachers’ epistemic cognition on constructivist teaching concepts through approaches to learning was not supported by the empirical data. The literature lacks findings on the mediating effects of epistemic cognition, approaches to learning, and concepts of teaching. Therefore, future studies should continue to explore the mediating effects of these three variables.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2928,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Growth Model of Oral Reading Fluency Among Second and Third Graders,Yuwen Chang,"oral reading fluency, piecewise growth model, growth rate, standard passages","Fluent reading is an indication of proficient decoding and comprehension. Studies have demonstrated that oral reading fluency (ORF) correlates positively with reading comprehension. The ORF assessment comprises a set of individually administered 1-minute reading probes. These tests are designed to monitor learning progress toward predetermined instructional goals and identify children who may require additional instructional support. Although many studies have explored Mandarin ORF performance levels at each grade, the reading probes used are generally adopted from textbooks. However, results have indicated that the curriculum-based ORF is 50 characters per minute more than that measured by the standard probe assessment. This suggests that reading fluency levels are affected by the equivalence of the reading probes. This study is the first to use standard probes to investigate the developmental and expected growth of Mandarin ORF in the second and third grades of elementary schools. The number of correct words read per minute (the level) and the growth rate of student reading fluency are two key indicators of reading progress. However, few studies have investigated the growth rate of Mandarin ORF. Early studies tended to assert that within-year ORF growth is linear rather than quadratic, but recent research has indicated that growth rates differ within a school year. This study examined the growth model of reading fluency and estimated its growth rate. Students with a large vocabulary tend to have a higher ORF level. According to the Matthew effect, students with higher ORF levels have a greater growth rate. Previous Mandarin ORF research does not support this inference. Furthermore, the correlation between initial ORF levels and growth rates has not been reported. However, this issue is important; if students with different ORF levels have different growth rates, then appropriate learning growth goals should be set based on their initial abilities when planning interventions. This study tracked the development of ORF skills over the course of one academic year to investigate the following research questions: (1) What are the growth models of ORF for second- and third-grade students in elementary schools? (2) What is the growth rate of ORF over the semesters for second- and third-grade students? (3) Is the growth rate for reading fluency related to the ORF level at the beginning of the semester? The participants comprised 57 second-grade and 51 third-grade students and 53 girls and 55 boys. The students underwent an ORF test (Chang, 2018). For each grade, 19 reading probes, with a text length of 350–400 characters, were used. The alternate-form reliability was between .80 and .89. The generalizability coefficients for the second- and third-grade conditions were approximately .84 and .85, respectively, when one reading probe was used to estimate ORF performance. When three reading probes were used, the generalizability coefficients were .94 and .95, respectively. The correlation coefficients between ORF score and reading comprehension test score were .60 and .67, respectively.The ORF tests were administered at 3-week intervals during each semester in the 2012 academic year. Each student took ORF tests at 13 time points, with three reading probes administered at the beginning of the school year (pretest), at the end of the first semester (midterm test), and at the end of the second semester (posttest). The average score across the three reading probes was calculated to obtain reliable growth rates. At each of the other time points, a single ORF score was collected. Eight examiners were trained in the administration and scoring of the ORF tests in a 4-hour workshop, during which the assessment and scoring procedures were introduced and the examiners practiced the procedures in pairs to ensure they could conduct the procedure reliably. Overall interrater reliability was .99 for this study. A hierarchical linear model was used to assess the goodness of fit between the data and five models: the null model (M0), random intercept model (M1), random coefficient model (M2), piecewise growth model (M3), and quadratic growth model (M4). The intraclass correlation (ICC) of the M0 model for the second grade was .73, meaning that 73% of the difference in reading fluency scores originated in differences between students (level 2) and 27% of the variance originated from differences within individuals (level 1). The ICC for the third grade was .81. The results suggested high heterogeneity between students and the necessity of a hierarchical model. Among five models, a piecewise growth model had the lowest deviance value and thus the best fit with the data. Thus, the children had different growth rates in the two semesters within the same academic year. On average, the number of characters the second and third graders could read correctly per minute was 109 and 137 at the beginning of the academic year, respectively. At the end of the third grade, the mean ORF was 165 characters. In the fall, the second-grade ORF growth averaged 13 characters per semester, whereas the average was approximately 18 characters per semester in the spring. The third graders’ mean growth rates were 20 and 6 characters in the first and second semesters, respectively. The second-grade growth rates in the two semesters were similar, but ORF gains were more modest during the second half of the academic year for the third grade. The correlation between ORF and the growth rate for the second-grade students was not significant. However, in the first semester of the third grade, the correlation between ORF and growth rate was significant and had a correlation coefficient of .32 . In the second semester, the correlation between ORF and growth rate was -.43. In different grades and semesters, the relationships between initial ORF and growth rate varied. This finding reminds teachers that they should consider the students’ grades and initial ORF when setting teaching goals. The results of this study established the expected ORF level and growth rate for second- and third-grade students, enabling teachers to identify high-risk students that are falling behind in reading to determine the effects of intervention by examining their change in growth rate and adjust their instruction accordingly. Knowing student’s ORF scores may help teachers plan reading instruction that is more responsive to the individual. By collecting multiple assessment scores, educators and researchers no longer must assume linear developmental trends because nonlinear functions can be fit to the time-series data. The nonlinear growth pattern suggests that instructional goals derived from a linear change model may require revision and that student growth expectations may require modification at different points in the academic year. The results only partially support the Matthew effect. At the beginning of the semester, the growth rate of the second-year students with strong ORF was not significantly greater than that of those with weaker ORF. However, in the first semester of the third grade, the level of ORF and the growth rate was significantly and positively correlated. Participants with strong reading fluency grew faster in their reading ability during the fall semester than those with weaker ORF. Therefore, the results may enable educators to recognize the need for more intensive instructional support during periods when rapid growth is expected, which is the second semester of the second grade through the first semester of third grade.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2922,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Feasibility of Virtual Reality in Measuring Psychological Assessment: Student and Psychologist Views,"Yu-Ling Lan, Yuhsuan Chang, Wan-Lan Chen, Ying-Fen Wang","objective structured clinical examination, psychological assessment, virtual reality","Psychological assessment has been regarded an essential competency domain in professional psychology. Influenced by the competency-based movement, researchers and educators start to redesign new measurement tools for assessing psychological assessment competencies (PACs) of psychologists from entry to practice. Compared with physicians and nurses, license examinations of professional psychologists still heavily rely on the paper-pencil tests to measure professional competencies of psychologists. In the past five decades, an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has become one of the most commonly used measurement tools to assess professional knowledge, clinical skills and professional attitudes of healthcare professionals at the same time. Several meta-analysis studies have confirmed that an OSCE is not only a reliable and valid measurement tool for assessing clinical competencies of healthcare professionals, but also a good teaching aid to facilitate a wide range of clinical skill training courses. In Taiwan, OSCEs have been widely used to assess professional competencies of physicians and nursing practitioners, however, its application in professional psychologists is still very limited. Lan et al. (2011) proposed four possible factors affecting the OSCE application in professional psychology. First of all, competencies in professional psychology (e.g., rapport building skills, expressions of empathy) are more abstract and difficult to measure than those in medicine and nursing. Second, it requires longer time and more effort to develop and administer a psychology OSCE than a medical OSCE or a nursing OSCE. Third, faculty members and practicing psychologists need to receive further training (e.g., taking an OSCE rater training workshop) to ensure that they reach inter-rater agreement before scoring student or participant performance on a psychology OSCE. Last but not least, the major obstacle to adopting OSCEs in professional psychology is high cost of running an OSCE on a regular basis. Compared with the resource input of a medical OSCE, the resource input of a psychology OSCE is relatively insufficient. If the cost of running a psychology OSCE could be effectively reduced, it would help to promote the OSCE application in professional psychology. To overcome the aforementioned problem, the virtual reality (VR) technology was applied in this study to develop a VR version of the Intake OSCE (VR-intake OSCE) to serve this need. The purpose of the present study was to examine the feasibility of the VR technology in assess competencies in psychological assessment through the viewpoints of students and psychologists. The present study comprises three phases: the testing phase 1, the testing phase 2 and the formal study phase. In the testing phase 1, six psychologists from master education to practice were hired as mock test takers to examine the versatility of the intake OSCE in assessing PACs of psychologists from counseling and clinical psychology. The intake OSCE was developed by Lan et al. (2015) to examine psychologists’ PACs when conducting an intake interview. This test consists of a standardized patient test (SP test), a follow-up short answer test (S test) and a multiple-choice test. In the testing phase 1, only the SP test and the S test were selected to examine the versatility of the intake OSCE in assessing PACs of psychologists from counseling and clinical psychology. No significant score differences were found between clinical psychologists and counseling psychologists. This result confirmed that the intake OSCE could be used to assess psychologists in both fields. In the testing phase 2, the same mock test takers (from the testing phase 1) were hired to evaluate the initial version of the VR-intake OSCE, which consists of a virtual standardized patient test (VSP test) and a follow-up S test. To administer a VSP test on the VR equipment, a new VSP system (called VR psychological assessment room) was developed in the present study to serve this need. By adopting the automatic speech recognition technology, the design of the VSP system allows participants to conduct an intake interview with the VSP through a free questioning format, and collect assessment related information (e.g., personal medical history, stressors, and social support) in order to generate a differential diagnosis of the VSP and also provide an initial treatment plan. All mock test takers first took the VR-intake OSCE, and then filled out the post-test questionnaire. This post-test questionnaire was designed to evaluate the quality of the initial version of the VR-intake OSCE and its test administration procedure. Responses provided by mock test takers were summarized as the followings. First of all, mock test takers considered the VR-intake OSCE did not only measure their PACs, but also their abilities to use the VR equipment and the VSP system. For psychologists with little or no VR experience, their test scores might be affected by unfamiliar use of the VR equipment and the VSP system. Second, a mock test taker reported that she felt dizzy and discomfort similar to motion sickness after taking the VSP test, and then affected her performance on the follow-up S test. Third, most of the mock test takers agreed that the VR-intake OSCE could be used to replace some assessment functions of the intake OSCE when its VSP system has been fully developed. Based on responses provided by mock test takers, the test administration procedure of the VR-intake OSCE in the formal study phase was revised as the followings. First, an additional practice VSP test would be provided to allow participants to familiarize the VR equipment and the VSP system before taking the VR-intake OSCE. Second, an intermission session between the VSP test and the follow-up S test would be extended from 5 minutes to 10 minutes to help participants to relieve possible dizziness and discomfort before taking the S test. In the formal study phase, a sample of 37 participants was recruited on a voluntary basis. All participants were divided into three groups (i.e., clinical student group, counseling student group, and counseling psychologist group) to examine the feasibility of the VR technology in assessing PACs of psychologists and the design of the VSP system. All participants first took the VR-intake OSCE, and then filled out a post-test questionnaire, which was designed to examine the feasibility of the VR technology in assessing PACs and the design of the VSP system. Results of the formal study revealed that the VR-intake OSCE was more feasible in assessing cognitive aspects of PACs (e.g., differential diagnosis and integrated inference) than behavioral aspects of PACs (e.g., communication skills and professional attitudes). In terms of the design of the VSP system, participants gave the “user interface” design and the “help function” design the highest evaluations. They also suggested that the designs of “voice recognition” and “interactivity” needed further improvement. From the viewpoints of students and psychologists, the application of VR technology in assessing PACs of psychologists from entry to practice is feasible. The cost-effective effect of using the VR-intake OSCE to replace the intake OSCE can be further investigated after its VSP system has reached a mature state. In the near future, researchers and educators who are willing to devote themselves to the VR application in psychology OSCEs can develop different types of VSP systems in order to assess a wide range of professional competencies (e.g., intervention, consultation, and supervision/teaching). They can also apply the VR technology to different types of clinical training courses to enhance the training effects and enrich in-class activities.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2929,53.2,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Exploring the Leadership Competencies Development of Novice Group Counselors: Cluster Analysis on Process Tracking, Item Comparison, and Learning Styles","Yu-Kuang Kevin Hsu, Chih-Pin Hsing","unstructured counseling group, counselor training, group counselor, group counseling supervision, group leadership competency","As group counseling has been validated as a therapeutic working model, it was considered one of the fundamental abilities of counseling related professionals by the Council for Accreditation of Counselling and Related Educational Programs in 2015 and is also considered a compulsory professional credit to be obtained within the domestic training courses in becoming a counselors in Taiwan. Therefore it is important to focus on the development of counseling profession and teaching supervision during the practical training of master level counselors to guarantee group counseling skills as one of the most important professional abilities for counselors. To better understand the development of leadership competencies of novice group counselors, it is important to consider both the actual practice of group counseling as well as the continuous investigation into the learning process and competencies of novice group counselors. This study utilizes the ‘Group Leadership Competencies Scale’ constructed by Wu and Hsu (2012, 2015) to focus on the exploration of unstructured counseling group leadership competencies. The connotation of eight group leadership competencies include: the competency to change and take action, the competency to facilitate cohesion in the group, the competency to intensify the group, the competency to guide and propel process, the competency to enhance individual, the competency to build the norm of interaction, the competency to breakthrough process obstacles and the competency to intensify learning and acquisition; the changes in competency during the four stages of group process can be observed to provide reference for understanding the leadership competencies of novice group counselors. The four objectives of this study can be summarized as follow: (1) the overview and analysis of novice group counselors’ leadership competencies as a whole: an exploration into the training process and the state of the progress of overall competencies. (2) the analysis of process change of novice group counselors’ various leadership competencies: exploration of the state of progress of various abilities during process. (3) The cluster analysis of novice group counselors’ leadership competencies learning style: investigation of various learning styles and overall performance existing in novice group counselor community through the change in practical leadership abilities. (4) the analysis of process change of various leadership competencies of novice group counselors with different learning styles: exploration of the progress during process of novice group counselors in different groups of learning styles. To answer the objectives of this study, the researchers collected data of 61 unstructured counseling group which ran for 10 sessions over the past five years with a total of 117 master level novice unstructured group leader counselors; the participating novice group counselors have all undergone 18 hours of unstructured group training course and consented to the setting of this study (to be videotaped during group process, writing up group records after each session and receive practical group supervision every week as the group proceeded). Group counselors were invited to fill out the ‘group counseling leadership competencies scale’ after the first session (beginning), fourth session (transformation), eighth session (working) and the tenth session (ending) and the data was used to assess the change in group process leadership competencies; 72 counselors out of 117 completed all required data and were chosen to be the object of this study. The study found that: (1) Novice group counselors show significant improvement in eight competencies and expressed higher than the scale’s norm in sub-item and total score at the ending stage. (2) There are three types of process trend: ‘continuous gradual progress’, ‘mid to end stage gradual progress’ and ‘lower at early stages but gradually increases at mid to end stages’ of the eight group leadership competencies. Only the competency to intensify the group was observed in the ‘continuous gradual progress’ trend category and this type of leadership competencies will grow with the group as it proceeds and show significant improvement during the four stages of group process reaching statistically significant difference. The ‘mid to end stage gradual progress’ trend category showed five different competencies: the competency to facilitate cohesion, the competency to guide and propel process, the competency to enhance individual, the competency to build the norm of interaction and the competency to breakthrough process obstacles; these competencies were higher at the transformation stage than the beginning stage but did not reach statistical difference between the two stages; the significant difference was rather seen after the group entered working stage. The ‘lower at early stages but gradually increases at mid to end stages’ trend category reflects on the competency to change and take action and the competency to end and strengthen change; although both competencies belong to the third stage of group process (but the difference analysis did not reach statistical significance between the beginning and transformation stage). (3) When cluster analysis was carried out on the learning styles of process leadership competencies, the participants could be divided into three self-evaluation groups (SEG): ‘high self-evaluation group’, ‘central-tendency selfevaluation group’ and ‘low self-evaluation group’. Regarding learning effectiveness, the central-tendency self-evaluation group reach significant difference in all eight competencies but the high and low self-evaluation groups did not reach significant difference in the competency to change and take action; the low self-evaluation group did not reach significant difference in both the competency to breakthrough process obstacles and the competency to end and strengthen change. (4) The high selfevaluation group expressed subjective high effectiveness in group leadership competencies in the beginning but dropped during the transformation stage and raised significantly during working stage and showed a smaller amplitude of rise during the ending stage The low self-evaluation group showed low subjective effectiveness in group leadership competencies at the beginning and dropped further during transformation stage; great improvement in the competencies were observed during working stage and continued to improve during the ending stage. The central-tendency self-evaluation group showed median subjective effectiveness in group leadership competencies but showed linear rise in subjective group leadership competencies during the transformation, working and ending stages and showed significant rise after the transformation stage. In addition, by comparing the learning process of individual competencies, in regards to the construction of group, all three SEGs showed either continuous slow growth all the way or leveling at the beginning and rise at middle to later stages. In regards to the advance and intensification of process, the central-tendency and low self-evaluation groups showed continuous slow growth all the way or leveling at the beginning and rise at middle to later stages whereas the high self-evaluation group showed decline at the beginning then rise again after the middle to later stages. On the aspect of individual change intervention, all three SEGs showed leveling or slow decline at the beginning but as the group reaches middle to later stages, the high self-evaluation group’s competency to enhance individual and the low self-evaluation group’s competency to change and take action even showed a reflexed decline.According to the results of this study, the overall leadership competencies and training process of novice group counselors may include aspects such as the outline of leadership competencies development, facilitated teaching and substantial benefits. On the aspects of the process of change and improvement in various leadership competencies, all of the eight competencies showed significant improvement at the ending stage (only the competency to enhance individual did not reach significant difference at the ending and working stages). This finding is a confirmation that the learning of various competencies can be positively predicted in a complete unstructured group process and the leadership of unstructured group can be considered as an effective way of training for group leadership competencies, only that different competencies may express different changing trends at different stages of group process. The examining of leadership competency learning styles and process change of each leadership competency allows for the exploration of the connotation and precautions for groups at the beginning and middle to later stages for novice group counselors of different self-evaluation levels. Finally, the researchers provided relevant suggestions for the learning of novice group counselors, the training of group leaders by counseling agencies, how governmental organizations could help, and the future research possibilities.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2909,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Professional Identity of Teacher-Counselors with a Psychology License in Elementary and Junior High Schools,"Chih-Pin Hsing, Che-Hsiu Hsu, Hsiu-Lan Shelley Tien, Yu-Kuang Kevin Hsu","psychology license, career transition, professional development, professional identification, guidance counselor","Counseling in elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan was limited due to a shortage of professionals in the field, but as school counseling work gradually gained recognition, legislation was enacted to incorporate professionals from different fields into school counseling through the construction of a framework of school counseling work with three levels: development, intervention, and treatment under the Tertiary Prevention System. In the current system, many teacher-counselors possess a counseling license as well as a teaching license. As such, they are both teachers responsible for secondary intervention counseling work and counselors responsible for tertiary treatment counseling work. If these dual professionals experience difficulty in identification, it may halt their professional development (Cinotti, 2015). Therefore, understanding the connotation of professional identification for these teachers is essential (Myers et al., 2002; Weinrach et al., 2011). Previous findings indicated that internal factors, external factors, and professional identification development processes jointly affect one’s professional identification on three levels. How these dual-profession teacher-counselors with counseling a license consider the connotation of professional identification through these three levels is an indispensable aspect of their professional development. Embedded in Taiwan’s unique division system for counseling work, this study examines the professional development and formation of identification of dual-profession counseling professionals. This study was aimed at understanding the context, identification, and dilemmas of dual-profession counselors in schools. Eight dual-profession counselors participated in in-depth interviews on their education background, how they perceive their position in the school counseling system, and their views and experiences regarding tertiary prevention counseling work in schools before they became a teacher-counselor, after entering a counseling-related postgraduate course, after obtaining the counseling license, and after assuming the role of a teacher-counselor. Their career transition path and professional identification were explored through content analysis of data from interviews. The interviews covered topics such as the path to developing the dual profession, factors contributing to their identification as “teacher-counselor,” factors contributing to their identification as “counselor,” the professional identifications of the two career paths, their current professional identification, and how the interviewees cope with dilemmas. Four major paths of career development were identified: 1) after obtaining a master’s degree, obtaining the counseling license and then entering schools as a teacher-counselor; 2) obtaining the teaching license after graduating from university and then completing a master’s program to obtain the counseling license; 3) becoming a counselor first and working as teacher-counselor and later obtaining a teaching license while working; and 4) after obtaining a master’s degree after working as teacher-counselor, becoming a counselor, and then returning to become a teacher-counselor later. Most of the interviewees worked longer as a teacher-counselor than as a counselor. The interviewees pursued the teacher-counselor career because the salary is stable, with high social expectations from relatives and friends. They identified with being a counselor because of the professionalism in professional work and the professional aura is beneficial for the cooperation of ecosystems. Work mode versus systemic role was discussed; some interviewees identified differences in roles as the complexity of professional work, degree of boundary maintenance, and angle of understanding the client; whereas others perceived the difference in the two roles as professional ability and the ability to adhere to the school’s ecosystem. For dual-profession counselors, the emphasis on the two roles may vary depending on the context. Therefore, the professional identification of the dual-profession counselors alternated, with four types as follows: “when in Rome, do as Romans do: identify with teacher-counselor and suppress the counselor identity”; “inconsistent: taking up the role of teacher-counselor but identify with counselor more”; “adaptation: adjust the proportion and representation of the two identities depending on the time and place”, and “inclusive: integrate the two identifications and form a new identification, where one coordinates and negotiates between the two professional roles and forms a multidisciplinary professional identification.” Their identification crisis generally arose when they experienced inner struggle and based on considerations with referred clients and the expectations of others in the system, which also includes the cooperation of the two roles at a professional level and a subtle, unseen competitive relationship between the two roles. The professionals employed the following four modes to respond to their professional identification dilemmas: “professional connection: participate in professional training courses”; “retreat in order to advance: redefining the meaning of systemic cooperation”, “seeking similarities from differences: starting dialogue with people with the same background”; and “mental segmentation: taking up the role of counselor outside the school.” This has also become an important issue when dual-profession counselors attempt to integrate their roles and navigate their place in the system. The results indicate that when teacher-counselor professionals choose between a career as a counselor and one as a teacher-counselor, they favor the second one due to realistic considerations, although some would prefer a career as a counselor due to its high level of professionalism. The difference in professional identification suggests that the training and supervision of teacher-counselors and counselors should be segmented. The “professional identification dilemma” and response to it reflects the dilemma of the professional themselves and the expectations of others regarding the dual profession. The results also indicate that elementary and junior high school teacher-counselors are more likely to develop the professional identification dilemma than senior high school guidance counselors. The professional career development path reflects how professionals with various job tenures respond to the professional identification dilemma—hence, the development of different states of professional identification. A dual-profession professional would tend to “go with the flow” of the school environment or accept the inconsistency between their job title and the content of the work they perform, but as one gradually works through the breaking-in period, one may adopt a professional identification that is best suited to the school environment or find a balance between the two professions while performing the job. Regarding the redefinition and reexamination of the professional identification of these teacher-counselor professionals, both they and their supervisors should pay close attention to the issue of identification, so that they can find their position in the system rather than splitting the options into two or limiting them to one role. Teacher-counselor professionals should be assisted in assimilating similar values within the professions and adjusting for the differences between the two. The contribution of this study is its depiction of the connotation of the professional identity of teacher-counselor professionals. It provides a reference for teacher-counselor professionals choosing career paths and draws attention to the welfare of teacher-counselor professionals. The paper concludes with suggestions for practice, additional research, and professional training.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2911,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Sexual assault has substantial longterm impacts on mental health, including depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress, substance abuse, sleep disturbance, and suicide (Black et al., 2011; Campbell et al., 2009; Smith & Freyd, 2013; Wang et al., 2014). Despite its psychological outcomes, relatively few survivors seek help from formal support networks (e.g., hospitals, sexual violence prevention centers, university counseling centers, and police), although many seek support from friends and family (Krebs et al., 2007, 2016; Sinozich & Langton, 2014; Wang et al., 2012). Furthermore, in response to coverage of the mistreatment of sexual assault survivors, researchers throughout the world have begun to examine how universities respond to sexual assault and its consequences (McCaskill, 2014). Institutional failures to respond to sexual assault cases (e.g., insensitive investigative practices) can result in secondary victimization, which may have serious impacts on a student’s mental health and career development (Campbell et al., 2009). In particular, institutional betrayal theory posits that wrongdoings perpetrated by university agencies (e.g., denying the survivor’s experiences or punishing them in some way) can cause feelings of institutional betrayal, exacerbating the sexual trauma experienced by survivors (Smith & Freyd, 2013, 2014). Approximately 20 years have passed since the implementation of the Gender Equity Education Act, which stipulates how schools at different levels should respond to sexual violence cases on campus. However, no study in Taiwan has systematically examined the psychological impacts of and university reactions to sexual assault among college students. The present study thus investigated (1) psychological impacts and (2) help-seeking behaviors with regard to sexual assault among college students, and, more crucially, (3) the prevalence and consequences of instances of institutional betrayal. In all, 617 Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students (45% female students, 81% were heterosexual, mean age = 23.14 years) completed an online survey including measures of sexual assault experiences (Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization; Koss et al., 2006), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, Cronbach’s α = .89; Kroenke et al., 2001), anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment, Cronbach’s α = .91; Spitzer et al., 2006), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index-Short Form, Cronbach’s α = .95; Wang, 2010), their willingness to report future assault to the campus reporting system (i.e., “Would you report future sexual victimization to your university or teachers?”), and demographics (e.g., age, gender, and sexual orientation). They also responded to an open-ended question regarding factors that might encourage/discourage the reporting of sexual victimization to their university. The responses were categorized by two independent coders with high interrater reliability (mean Cohen’s κ = .84, range = .73– .93). Additional questions were administered if respondents reported being victimized, including their help-seeking behaviors after the assault (i.e., “Whom did you seek help from after the assault?”) as well as experiences of institutional betrayal by their university (Institutional Betrayal and Support Questionnaire Version 1, Cronbach’s α = .94; Rosenthal et al., 2016). In the survey, 34 (6%) respondents reported one or more experiences of sexual assault while attending college, and most of the cases were on campus and conducted by male perpetrators, with both genders equally likely to be victimized (χ2(1, N = 617) = 0.94, p = .33). Compared with heterosexuals (5%), nonheterosexual students (9%) were more likely to report sexual assault victimization (χ2(1, N = 617) = 4.20, p = .04). Regarding negative psychological outcomes, sexual assault survivors reported more anxiety and depression symptoms (both p < .001) than did nonsurvivors; survivors also experienced posttraumatic symptoms. Among the 30 survivors who answered questions regarding help-seeking behaviors, 21 (70%) had sought help from classmates (n = 13), friends (n = 7), family members (n = 5), or a partner (n = 1). By contrast, only seven (23%) had sought help from formal support networks, such as their university or teachers (n = 4), university counseling centers (n = 2), or the local domestic violence and sexual assault prevention center (n = 1). Six (20%) survivors had not told anyone about the event. Furthermore, female students and survivors were less willing to report future sexual victimization to their university or teachers (both p < .02). Through analysis of the open-ended responses, we identified five factors that influence colleges student willingness to report a case to their school, namely the characteristics of the case (12%), perpetrator’s identity (14%), survivor’s feelings (9%), characteristics of the university (50%), and social relationships and face (15%). For institutional betrayal, the most common inadequate reactions from the university included “making it difficult to report the experience” (60%), “not taking proactive steps to prevent this type of experience” (53%), and “denying his/her experience in some way” (50%). Unlike in previous research, we observed little evidence of the psychological consequences of institutional betrayal. Institutional betrayal was unrelated to depression (r = .36, p = .052), anxiety (r = .33, p = .08), PTSD (r = .30, p = .10), and willingness to report future assault (r = .06, p = .76). More studies are required to examine the relationship between institutional betrayal and psychological symptoms. Sexual assault is a serious problem for Taiwanese college students. Male students were equally likely to be victimized, which is at odds with previous findings (e.g., Conley et al., 2017; Hines et al., 2012). Most research in Taiwan has focused on female sexual survivors; more attention should be paid to male survivors. The situation of nonheterosexual students must also be considered, as they face higher risk of sexual assault. The psychological impacts of sexual assaults are significant, but survivors rarely formally report their case to the university. Creating a university reporting system with accessibility, confidentially, trust, and fairness as well as improving student attitudes toward the university are urgent concerns. Much research is required on this topic. Different types of institutional betrayal experiences were reported by the sexual survivors in this study. Even for those who did not seek help from the university, a hostile campus climate can cause a feeling of betrayal. However, the relationships between institutional betrayal and psychological symptoms or help-seeking behaviors are unclear, which may be due to the small sample size of survivors (n = 30). Colleges and universities should nevertheless be aware of these negative experiences and the feelings of sexual survivors. Future research should examine connections among the variables in larger representative samples. The study had limitations. First, the survey used convenience sampling; thus, our findings cannot be understood to indicate the “prevalence” of sexual assault among Taiwanese college students. Second, we did not examine the effects of the perpetrator–victim relationship on sexual trauma. If the perpetrator was a teacher, the unequal power relations may result in more severe institutional betrayal and frustration. Future research should examine the impacts of sexual assault in different interpersonal contexts. Third, this study did not conduct university-level analyses. The roles of campus climate and culture in a given university and how they influence survivor behaviors and attitudes should be considered. Finally, some respondents directly mentioned the word “face” in their open-ended responses. The fear of losing face may be a key cultural factor when Taiwanese survivors decide whether to formally report a case. Future research should examine the impacts of sexual assault in different contexts as well as consider the influences of culture.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2912,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Transformation of Relationship Between the Bereaved and Deceased and Promotion of Grief Adjustment: Activity Involving Conversations with the Deceased,Yao-Ming Lo,"grief adjustment, object relations theory, continuing bonds, deceased","Most grief theories have been proposed by Western scholars, and Taiwanese studies about coping with grief are primarily based on Western theories. However, death and grief in Taiwanese society are primarily influenced by Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. In recent years, Taiwanese psychologists have proposed that Confucian societies such as Taiwan value harmony and balanced relationships with the deceased, spirits, and deities. Therefore, the bereaved have an ethical responsibility to perform a series of funeral rituals and to pray for deities to provide guidance to the deceased’s soul, such that the deceased can become a “deity” who protects the bereaved; otherwise, the deceased becomes a spirit, and the bereaved family cannot be at ease. In addition, funerals can catalyze the expression of grief and allow relatives to interact and provide support. After the deceased becomes a deified ancestor, the bereaved family worships the deceased regularly to cope with unresolved emotions and obtain blessings. Psychologists have proposed that, in Confucian societies, the goals of grief healing include ensuring that the bereaved achieves harmony and balance; the harmony of the relationship among the deceased, spirits, and deities is used to assess the grieving process and aid the bereaved in finding inner harmony. Per object relations theory, mourning repairs the damages loss causes to internal objects. Objects can be good or bad, and the study of object relations considers the interaction between the self and internal or external objects. Introjecting good objects is the foundation of positive object relations; individuals can think of these good internal objects and be reminded that good things exist even when the individuals suffer. The self eventually integrates the good and bad parts of the self and the object, achieving a complete object relationship. However, some individuals may be unable to develop a complete object relationship. Therefore, this study extends the interpretation of object relations theory as follows: When a bereaved individual introjects a deceased individual as a bad internal object associated with mostly bad object images, ideas, fantasies, feelings, and memories, the bereaved individual may continue to grieve because of continuing bonds. Nevertheless, if the bereaved individual can reminisce or introject good objects related to the deceased individual and integrate good and bad objects, then a complete object relationship can be developed. Therefore, this study considers grief derived from bereavement to be a response to a disharmonious relationship with the deceased and assumes the necessity of funeral rituals or other means of achieving a harmonious relationship. Although studies have indicated that the funeral rituals practiced in Confucian societies can help bereaved individuals to release their grief and maintain a harmonious relationship with the deceased, some bereaved individuals may experience grief for years because of many external factors (such as the rules of funeral rituals and social norms) and thus maintain a disharmonious relationship with the deceased. Studies have found that bereaved individuals have a tacit understanding of grief expression and follow emotional rules for expressing grief. Because bereaved individuals must account for the feelings of others and a multitude of external factors, they are unlikely to talk about deceased individual or express grief to family members and other people. Therefore, after the funeral period, most bereaved individuals convert their grief into self-repression and individual relief.Both Eastern and Western sources state that the expression of grief and maintenance of bonds with deceased individuals are strategies for coping with grief; therefore, the present study incorporated these concepts into an activity in which a bereaved individual engages in a conversation with the deceased. Studies have indicated that experiential death education is superior to didactic death education. Therefore, the present study adopted experiential death education. We divided the activity into three parts associated with a specific objective: knowing the deceased, reminiscing, and conversing with the deceased. By achieving these objectives, a bereaved individual might share a bereavement experience as well as stories and good memories of the deceased by creating a safe environment to experience and express grief. In our activity, a bereaved individual is blindfolded and instructed to breathe and relax with mindfulness and to imagine walking toward the door at the center of the universe. Upon reaching and opening the door, the deceased individual appears in front of the bereaved individual and takes a form determined by the bereaved individual’s imagination (which incorporates introjections of internal objects). The bereaved individual can then express their thoughts to the deceased and receive or feel the thoughts of the deceased. After participating in this activity, the bereaved individual is instructed to write down the thoughts received from the deceased individual.The present study examined the transformation of the relationship between the bereaved and deceased individual and the grief adjustments made by the bereaved while participating in this activity. A qualitative methodology was applied in the present study. A study sample comprising five participants (four women and one man) aged between 45 and 55 years was recruited. Data were collected using in-depth interviews and analyzed using hermeneutic analysis. The results were as follows. (1) Before participating in this activity, the participants had experienced grief for years and had disharmonious relationships with the deceased; however, by participating in the activity, they adjusted their grief, and their relationships with the deceased became harmonious. (2) The transformation of the relationships between bereaved individuals and the deceased can be attributed to the safe learning environment created during the activity, which allowed the bereaved to express their grief, recall their memories of the deceased, and converse with deceased; these processes resulted in opportunities for the bereaved to create and evoke good internal objects associated with the deceased. In addition, mindfulness and breathing helped them to release their thoughts and emotions and maintain a sense of awareness.The findings of the present study are as follows. (1) Unresolved grief is often closely related to a disharmonious relationship with the deceased. For individuals who had been mourning for years, the culture of mourning rituals, through which they maintained a relationship with the deceased, was not a safe social environment for expressing grief. (2) The activity provides an environment for individuals to express their grief, establish a positive connection and converse with the deceased, transform their relationship with the deceased into a harmonious or complete object relationship, and achieve grief adjustment. Taiwanese psychologists have proposed that bereaved individuals can participate in grief healing and find peace through mourning rituals; however, over time, such rituals may gradually become insufficient or be ignored. Conversing with the deceased not only helps bereaved individuals to repair their relationships with the deceased but also establishes an interpersonal network through which bereaved individuals can work through their grief. These findings support the implementation of grief adjustment–related support measures for bereaved individuals and warrant the further investigation and development of grief adjustment activities.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2913,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Psychological Differences Between Opponents and Proponents of Same-Sex Marriage: The Linguistic Analysis Approach,"Wei-Fang Lin, Chin-Lan Huang, I-Ching Lee","Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), same-sex marriage, motivation, cognitive process","Despite being the first Asian country to legalize same-sex marriage, same-sex marriage continues to be controversial in Taiwanese society. Extensive research has attempted to explain attitudes toward same-sex marriage on the basis of religion, gender, and stereotypes. Few studies, however, have focused on the psychological differences between opponents and proponents of same-sex marriage. We adopted the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) method to examine the psychological differences between these two camps. The LIWC method was developed by Pennebaker and his research team and has since become a widely used computer-aided text-analysis method. The essential assumption of the LIWC method is that word usage in certain categories serves as a language marker that reflects an individual’s focuses, thoughts, feelings, and psychological state. Given that same-sex marriage is still a controversial topic in Taiwan’s society, individuals may feel pressured to truly express their attitudes and thoughts. An advantage of the LIWC method is that it ignores context; only word count is used for indices, which could help reveal individuals’ inner psychological processes.The present research used language markers to understand individuals’ self–other boundaries, motivations, and cognitive processes. We argue that opponents of same-sex marriage have a clear self–other boundary; they view heterosexual individuals as an ingroup, and non-heterosexual individuals, an outgroup. Accordingly, we hypothesized that relative to proponents, opponents tend to use fewer first-person singular and plural pronouns (indicating less self-involvement and shared identity, respectively) and more third-person plural pronouns (indicating a clear distinction between heterosexuality and nonheterosexuality) when discussing topics involving same-sex marriage. Second, we analyzed the motivations of opponents and proponents. Previous studies of political ideology have revealed that those holding liberal views emphasize affiliation whereas those with conservative views emphasize power. Those with conservative views tend to perceive the government as an authoritarian and disciplinary parent; they want to preserve the current power structure of the society that favors individuals who identify as heterosexual. Because it is primarily those holding liberal social views that promote the legislation of samesex marriage, we hypothesized and found that proponents would tend to use more affiliation-oriented words and that opponents would tend to use more power-oriented words when discussing same-sex marriage. Lastly, we attempted to differentiate the cognitive processing of proponents and opponents. Previous research has indicated that the majority and minority practice disparate methods of persuasion. The majority influence others through normative social influence, which induces people to conform because they want to be accepted and are fearful of violating group norms. By contrast, the minority influence others through informational social influence, which changes people’s beliefs and behaviors by convincing them that the minority have accurate information. The information provided is expected to be carefully analyzed, to serve this purpose, well-reasoned and logically consistent arguments are crucial. Therefore, we hypothesized that proponents, as the minority, tend to demonstrate more cognitive complexity in their arguments regarding same-sex marriage.We conducted two studies to test our hypotheses. In Study 1, we analyzed opinions expressed in newspapers and online media. We collected 60 articles with an equal number of opinions written by opponents and proponents to compare the difference between these two camps. All text files were processed using the Chinese word segmentation system developed by the Chinese Knowledge and Information Processing (CKIP) group and subsequently analyzed using the LIWC2015 application and C-LIWC2015 dictionary. The average word count of the text files used in Study 1 was 1124.32 (SD = 666.32), and the LIWC detection rate was 77.32% (SD = 4.40). We performed independent-samples t-tests to examine our hypotheses and discovered that, relative to opponents, proponents tended to use more first-person plural pronouns and affiliation-oriented words but fewer power-oriented words; their written opinions also exhibited higher cognitive complexity.In Study 2, we examined whether word usage characteristics identified for the opponents and proponents in Study 1 could predict an individual’s attitude (pro or against) toward same-sex marriage. The data were drawn from the transcripts of two public hearings held by Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan in 2016. All transcripts were processed in the same way as in Study 1. The average word count of the transcripts used in Study 2 was 1368.07 (SD = 388.90), and the LIWC detection rate of the transcripts was 81.09% (SD = 4.17). Independent-samples t-tests in Study 2 yielded similar results to that in Study 1. Relative to opponents, proponents tended to use more first-person plural pronouns and affiliation-oriented words but fewer power-oriented words. However, no significant difference in cognitive complexity was observed between proponents and opponents. We suspect that the speakers at the public hearing were experts and therefore capable of giving well-prepared speeches. Furthermore, the results of a logistic regression indicated that individuals who used more affiliation-oriented words were more likely to support same-sex marriage. By contrast, individuals who used more power-oriented words were more likely to oppose same-sex marriage. The findings from Studies 1 and 2 highlight the psychological differences between proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage. Specifically, the proponents tended to express a shared identity and were more interested in establishing social connections than the opponents; they also demonstrated higher cognitive complexity in their written opinions. The opponents, tended to use power and status words than the proponents. According to our results, we offer suggestions for improving the communication between the two camps, so social equality in the near future may be achieved. First, understanding the psychological difference between the two camps is the first step for better communication. The underlying concern of the opponents is that the legislation of same-sex marriage may be detrimental to the existing social structure and traditional family functions. Thus, for the proponents to have their messages heard by the opponents, it may be better to address the opponents’ negative feelings rather than well-formulated reasons. Second, our findings suggest that even though the Gender Equality Education Act was implemented in 2004 in Taiwan, gender and sexual minorities - still face substantial prejudice in our society, which may be detrimental to their mental and physical health. Gender equality education programs dispelling preconceptions regarding homosexuality and improving students’ understanding of various sexual identities may be most valuable to tackle such prejudice. Third, our findings demonstrate that a linguistic method such as LIWC can be applied to study controversial social topics. Unlike self-report measurements, which would be prone to social desirability, the frequency of word usage serving as a language marker is hard to manipulate and may reflect individuals’ inner processes. Future studies can apply LIWC to examine the psychological differences between proponents and opponents of other controversial social issues such as abortion or the death penalty.In summary, we applied a linguistic method to clarify the psychological differences between proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage in terms of their self–other boundaries, motivations, and cognitive complexity. Future studies can expand the practical applications of our findings to further gender and marriage equality objectives.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2914,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
How Empathy Develops? A Theatre-Based Training Approach,"Gin-Hong Lee, Ming-Teh Lin","empathy teaching, improvisational theatre, playback theatre, psychology students, qualitative research","Theoretically the concept of empathy includes four components: the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and moral empathy. In empathy training it is challenging to develop the emotional and behavioral empathy. Empathy is about human interactions. If there is a lack of real interpersonal interaction experience in the learning process, students will face many barriers and gaps in practice in the future. Empathy is the ability to understand and empathize with people. It is the basic capacity of psychology students, and it is necessary to learn in actual interpersonal interaction. Theatre-based training provide such an opportunity for students to “encounter with others” in class, that is, a chance to have real contact with their peers. There are some theatre-based training approach related to empathy learning such as “improvisational theatre” and “playback theatre”. These two kinds of theatre approach have developed various lively games and exercises that help train empathy in the process of training actors. Many studies explored empathy in medical education through theatre-based technique mostly focused on effectiveness rather than process. Therefore, there is less research data on how students experience the teaching process and how empathy occurs.In the past ten years, the authors have used theatre-based training to teach empathy in universities and hospitals. This crossdisciplinary innovative teaching method is fresh and interesting, and can also produce impressive learning experience. After establishing a cross-domain pedagogy, the question that the authors are curious to explore is how students learn about empathy in theatre-based training? The subjects included sixty-four undergraduate students from three courses in Department of Clinical Psychology in Fu Jen Catholic University. The allotted time of empathy teaching sessions in the three courses were: four 2-hour sessions for “The Skills and Practice for Helping People”, four 3-hour sessions for “Expressive Arts Therapy”, and six 3-hour sessions for “Drama and Interpersonal Exploration”. The faculties of “The Skills and Practice for Helping People” and “Expressive Arts Therapy” included the two authors and three theatre teachers. The three theatre teachers who specialized in improvisational theatre and playback theatre led the sessions respectively, and the two authors assisted and observed in these sessions. The sessions of “Drama and Interpersonal Exploration” were led by another theatre teacher and the second author, and these sessions were observed by the first author. The theatre teachers used the modified training exercises from playback theatre and improvisational theatre in these sessions. The authors collected data from students’ feedback questionnaire, reflection writings, and comments in Facebook group of the course. Qualitative research methods were used to analyze these data.The results indicated four themes illustrating the possible pathways that empathy leaning may happen. (1) Through watching and listening: when the stories were enacted or other actions of peers displayed, students learn as observers to watch and listen to the peer’s story, their own story, the interaction between them and peers in the training exercises .The watching and listening process facilitated emotions and thoughts related to empathy. (2)Through body action: when students enacted as actors or interacted with each other through physical actions, they perceived with their body and had feelings inside. As if the exterior body theatre initiated the imaginative inner theatre. (3) Through mutual feedback: when students gave and took feedback mutually after watching, listening or body action, they also learned from each other. Taking feedback helped modify the understanding, enhance the sense of achievement and motives of empathy. Giving feedback helped clarify one’s own feeling, be appreciative of others’ empathetic behavior. (4) Through experience combing: when students narrated or wrote about the course experience, they reflected on the experience and constructed the meaning. Students stayed focus, integrated their feeling and thoughts, and made meaning of the course experience and past experience. The four pathways are related to the four components of empathy: cognition, emotion, action, and morality. “Watching and listening” triggers students’ emotional resonance and cognitive understanding of the targets they are observing. The learning component includes both “emotional empathy” and “cognitive empathy”. “Body action” means that students directly practice “empathetic action” with their body movements. It is also easier to trigger physical sensations and resonance reactions by using the body to engage in interactive positions. Therefore, there are more of “emotional empathy” learning when students participate with their body action. “Mutual feedback “ allows students to learn as empathizers on the one hand and as being empathized on the other. Both positive mutual feelings are helpful to enhance students’ affirmation and motivation to practice empathy, which leads to the learning of “moral empathy”. “Experience combing” helps students integrate all the previous learning feelings and thoughts, and have a deeper meaning toward empathy in the four components of empathy.We suggest educators aiming to teach empathy to design the curriculum in reference to these four pathways, especially the focus of “body action” could help students “get up and move” and learn from their actions instead of only learning from lecture. “Body action” is not necessarily a dramatic performance, but can be a simple exercise, such as retelling the story and gazing at each other’ eyes for few minutes. The key point is that after “watching and listening” and “body action”, teachers need to facilitate students to go through “mutual feedback” and “experience combing” in a way that students feel comfortable with. The focus of “mutual feedback” is to encourage students to give feedback in an appreciative way after the exercise. Teachers can use feedback questions such as “what is the part they have tried to do”, “what they have done well”, and “what they feel touched”, so that the feedback improves their confidence and motivation. The focus of “experience combing” is to encourage students to use group discussions or class writing methods to collect their feelings and thoughts, and to generate deeper meanings related to their own lives. When these meanings are intertwined with students’ lives, the course experience can create an impression and accumulate the energy for behavior change.These four pathways point out that the characteristic of applying theatre-based training in empathy education is to trigger profound thoughts and emotional reactions through the observation of real story performance and interpersonal interaction, and through one’s own physical action experience, to clarify the empathy experience with peer feedback, and to reflect on the experience to obtain new learning meanings.The insight and new understanding generated in the classroom will motivate students to change the way they interact with others outside the classroom, including their family or friends. This kind of application and change that continues outside the classroom is appealing to educators. If educators have the opportunity to continue the teaching of the last mile, they can successfully complete the fourth stage of Kolb’s experiential learning cycle—active experimentation. It is recommended that future courses explore the topic of application and practice. After all, transforming students from classroom learners to practitioners in life is the ultimate goal of education.Further research is needed to focus on how the cultivation of empathetic classroom atmosphere and the focus of instruction influence empathy learning, and how to apply empathy learning experience in daily life.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2915,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Moderating Role of Religion Between Implicit and Explicit Attitudes on Opinions Same-Sex Marriage: A Study from Taiwan Implicit Association Test Database,"Cheng-Yi Tang, Jen-Ho Chang","same-sex marriage, implicit attitude, explicit attitude, religion, traditional family value","By December 2020, 29 countries (or jurisdictions within them) had legalized same-sex marriage. In Taiwan, the issue of same-sex marriage was not taken seriously in the past, but it became one of the most controversial issues in recent years. In 2017, the chief justice of Taiwan ruled that prohibiting same-sex marriage was unconstitutional, and this ruling required the Legislative Yuan to establish laws allowing same-sex marriage by 2019. However, the result of a referendum in 2018 opposed the recognition of same-sex marriage. This result reveals the tension between proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage. The current study investigated the effect of religion and support for traditional family values on the relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes toward homosexuality and opinion on same-sex marriage. Some of the most influential organizations opposing same-sex marriage in Taiwan have religious backgrounds, especially Catholicism and other Christian denominations. Although such organizations do not present their religion as the main reason for opposing same-sex marriage; they claim to want to protect traditional family values (fulfilling familial obligations by having and raising children) and monogamy (in contrast with promiscuity and sexual openness). More importantly, religious individuals have strong implicit and explicit attitudes and may behave accordingly. The current study examined whether religious beliefs moderate the relationship of implicit and explicit attitudes with opinions on same-sex marriage. Specifically, the relationship between individual attitudes (both implicit and explicit) and opinion on same-sex marriage legislation in Taiwan may be enhanced by religious beliefs that do not support same-sex relationships (such as Christianity and Islam). In addition, this moderation may be mediated by the endorsement of traditional family values. Therefore, this study evaluated a moderated mediation model of the effects of religious beliefs and endorsement of family values on the relationships between implicit and explicit attitudes and opinions on same-sex marriage.For Study 1, 2599 Taiwanese participants (69% female; mean age = 24.09 years, SD = 5.12) were recruited from an implicit association test (IAT) database. After providing their background information, including their gender, age, and religion, the participants were measured their implicit and explicit attitudes (two items, r = .27) toward homosexuality and whether they support same-sex marriage (only one item). The results revealed that religious beliefs moderated the relationships of both implicit (b = 0.16, p = .01) and explicit attitudes (b = 0.07, p < .001) toward homosexuality with opinion on same-sex marriage. Among individuals following religions (e.g., Christianity or Islam) opposing same-sex relationships, implicit attitude toward homosexuality was more strongly associated with opinion on same-sex marriage (b = 0.21, p < .001), whereas, among those without religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships, implicit attitude toward homosexuality was weaklier associated with opinion on same-sex marriage (b = 0.05, p = .01). Moreover, religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships increased the strength of the relationship between explicit attitude toward homosexuality and opinions on same-sex marriage (b = 0.14, p <.001), whereas, for people with religious beliefs not opposing same-sex relationships, explicit attitude toward homosexuality had a lower association with opinion on same-sex marriage (b = 0.05, p = .01). In summary, the findings of Study 1 support our hypothesis that religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships increase the correlation between both implicit and explicit attitudes toward homosexuality and opinions on same-sex marriage.Study 2 further investigated the results of Study 1 by using comprehensive and validated measurements for both the IAT and survey scales. In addition, the IAT was modified: The original questions about abstract concepts (good vs. bad) were replaced with ones on sexual openness (promiscuity vs. monogamy). For Study 2, 192 participants (62% female; mean age = 23.36 years, SD = 3.31) were recruited. After providing their background information, including their gender, age, and religion, the participants were asked about their implicit and explicit attitudes toward homosexuality (five items, Cronbach’s α = .84), traditional family values (having and raising children, parenting with family members; 22 items, Cronbach’s α = .87), and their opinions on same-sex marriage (11 items, Cronbach’s α = .93). The results of Study 2 revealed that religious beliefs moderated the relationship between opinions on same-sex marriage and implicit attitudes toward homosexuality and opinions on same-sex marriage (b = −1.24, p = .02) but not explicit attitudes (b = 0.02, p = .56). Simple slope analysis revealed that, for those with religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships, promiscuity bias increased the correlation between implicit attitudes and opinion on same-sex marriage (b = 2.57, p < .01), whereas for those without religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships, promiscuity bias was not related to the relationship between their attitudes toward homosexuality and opinion on same-sex marriage (b = 0.29, p = .06). Furthermore, a moderated mediation analysis was conducted in which belief in traditional family values was the mediator of the effect of religion on the relationship between implicit and explicit attitudes and same-sex marriage stance. The results of 5000-iteration bootstrapping indicated moderated mediation (b = −0.24, 95% CI, −0.53, −0.08). Follow-up analysis revealed that for those with religious beliefs opposing same-sex relationships and support for traditional family values, implicit attitudes continued to predict their opinions on same-sex marriage (b = −0.24, 95% CI, −0.53, −0.08). However, for those with religious beliefs not opposing same-sex relationships, this indirect path via traditional family values did not represent a mediation effect (b = 0.04, 95% CI, −0.01, 0.12). In summary, the findings of Study 2 support our hypothesis of the moderation effect of religion on the relationship between implicit attitudes toward homosexuality and opinions on same-sex marriage in the presence of promiscuity bias. Specifically, religious beliefs opposing same-sex marriage increased the strength of the relationship between implicit attitude and opinion on same-sex marriage. Furthermore, moderated mediation analysis demonstrated that traditional family values mediated the relationship between implicit attitude and same-sex marriage that was moderated by religious beliefs. These findings provide insights that may build a bridge between proponents and opponents of same-sex marriage and help them to communicate, thereby reducing tension in Taiwanese society.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2916,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Model of Resilience to Learning Frustration: The Relationships Among Psychological Capital, Social Capital, Frustration Tolerance, Positive Emotions, and Adaptive Motivational Engagement",Ying-Fen Chang,"psychological capital, positive emotions, social capital, frustration tolerance, adaptive motivational engagement","Educational psychology attaches great importance to the influence of the external environment on the individual, but this view appears to ignore that the individual does not passively accept everything in the external environment and has internal power to respond to the external environment. Resilience theory (Garmezy, 1991; Werner, 1982), however, suggests that an individual’s adaptability does not fluctuate with the external environment and emphasizes the inherent resilience of the individual. Because of this theory’s advantages, this study focused on resilience. Resilient qualities, resilience programs, and the resilience process are three major topics within resilience research (Bolton et al., 2017; Richardson, 2002). Studies have comprehensively analyzed resilient qualities (Chan et al., 2009; Gillespie et al., 2007) and resilience programs (Chen et al., 2014; Knight et al., 2019; Torsney & Symonds, 2019). Many scholars (Flach, 1988, 1997; Richardson, 2002) believe that resilience is a process and requires further investigation. However, insufficient data are available on the resilience process.Previous literature (Flach, 1988, 1997; Richardson, 2002; Wang et al., 2017) have provided few specific details about important protective factors for resilience and how they are related in the resilience process; this makes it challenging to determine which protective factors help initiate the resilience process and what type of resilience individuals achieve. In other words, studies have found it difficult to concretize the resilience process. Furthermore, studies (Shih & Wu, 2017; Chao et al., 2018) have stated that students’ learning path is full of frustration; thus, resilience is essential to them. However, few studies have focused on learning frustration in relation to the resilience process. Therefore, this study sought to fill the research gap and become a basis for teaching guidance. Accordingly, this study analyzed the process through which junior high school students develop resilience to learning frustration.According to the resilience process model (Richardson, 2002), Flach’s ideas (1988, 1997), constructive failure theory (Clifford, 1988), and Mencius’s views (Fu, 2004), resilience may be related to pre-existing protective factors, additional protective factors, wisdom and ability, and adaptation results, and the relationships among them may be that existing protective factors predict adaptation results through additional protective factors and improved wisdom and ability. According to conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), Luthans et al. (2004), and other studies (Baluku et al., 2016; Jung & Yoon, 2015), psychological capital and social capital may serve as pre-existing and additional protective factors, respectively, in the process of junior high school students developing resilience to learning frustration. Frustration tolerance can be regarded as improved wisdom and ability in the process of junior high school students developing resilience to learning frustration (Clifford, 1988; Huang & Lin, 2013). According to coping strategy theory (Folkman & Lazarus, 1998), positive emotions and adaptive motivational engagement can serve as adaptation results in the resiliency process of learning frustration for junior high school students. This study analyzed the process of junior high school students developing resilience to learning frustration by exploring the relationships among psychological capital, social capital, frustration tolerance, positive emotions, and adaptive motivational engagement.Although studies have provided interpretations of psychological capital, frustration tolerance, positive emotions, and adaptive motivational engagement, the connotation of social capital remains unclear. On the bases of the social support model (House, 1981), emotional regulation theory (Chiang, 2015; Gross, 2002), the viewpoints of scholars on seeking help (Newman, 1991, 1994), and self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2002), a second-order confirmatory factor analysis of social capital was conducted to analyze social capital among junior high school students, and a social capital scale for junior high school students containing subscales on emotional regulation and problem-solving resources was created. Based on related literature, a model of the process of resilience to learning frustration was constructed to analyze the relationships among psychological capital, social capital, frustration tolerance, positive emotions, and adaptive motivational engagement among junior high school students. According to self-worth theory (Covington, 1992), the viewpoints of scholars on seeking help (Newman, 1991, 1994), and past research (Lin et al., 2013; Luthans & Youssef, 2004; Newman, 1990; Ryan & Pintrich, 1997), psychological capital may positively predict social capital. According to conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), the control–value theory of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 2000), expectancy–value theory (Wigfield & Eccles, 2000), and related research (Carmona-Halty et al., 2019; Chang, 2019; Chen, 2017; Cheng et al., 2018; Lai & Wu, 2018; Naveira, 2015; Tsaur et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2017), psychological capital may positively predict frustration tolerance, positive emotions, and adaptive motivational engagement.According to the social support model (House, 1981), emotional regulation theory (Chiang, 2015; Gross, 2002), the viewpoints of scholars on seeking help (Newman, 1991, 1994), self-determination theory (Ryan & Deci, 2002), and previous research (Jang et al., 2009; Joe et al., 2017; Lin, 2016; Liu et al., 2016), social capital may positively predict frustration tolerance, positive emotions, and adaptive motivational engagement. Frustration tolerance may positively predict positive emotions and adaptive motivational engagement (Clifford, 1988). According to the model proposed by Lazarus (1991), the cognitive–motivation model of achievement emotions (Pekrun, 1992), broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 2004), and previous research (Chien & Cherng, 2013; Huang, 2010; Pekrun et al., 2002), positive emotions may predict adaptive motivational engagement.The current study recruited 1867 junior high school students and employed structural equation modeling. The following results were obtained: (a) The second-order confirmatory factor analysis model of social capital and resilience to learning frustration fitted the observed data well. (b) Psychological capital positively predicted social capital and frustration tolerance. (c) Social capital positively predicted frustration tolerance and positive emotions. (d) Frustration tolerance positively predicted positive emotions and adaptive motivational engagement, (e) Positive emotions positively predicted adaptive motivational engagement.In summary, the results of this study indicate that junior high school students’ resilience to learning frustration starts with psychological capital (a pre-existing protective factor), which enables students to obtain social capital (an additional protective factor) by motivating them seek help, and these two factors help students to ultimately recover their positive emotions and achieve adaptive motivational engagement (adaptation results) by improving their frustration tolerance (wisdom and ability). These results concretize the process through which junior high school students develop resilience to learning frustration and fill the research gap.Although psychological capital, social capital, frustration tolerance, positive emotions, and adaptive motivational engagement are all critical factors in positive psychology, few studies have investigated them simultaneously, especially as they relate to process of developing resilience. This study, based on resilience and many related theories, explored the relationships among these variables in response to the contemporary prominence of positive psychology and exemplifies the integration of resilience research with other issues. The study results can be used as a reference for teaching and guidance. The findings imply that parents and teachers can encourage students to increase their tolerance of learning frustration to allow them to handle greater challenges in the future. Counselors can also use the study results to develop resilience programs focusing on learning frustration.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2917,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Supervisory Mindsets and Strategies Applied in Postmodern Narrative and Collaborative Approaches for Group Supervision,"Hsin-Yi Li, Hsiu-Lan Shelley Tien, Shi-Jiuan Wu, Meng-Ning Wang","grounded theory, group supervision process, postmodern narrative-collaborative approach (PNCA), supervisory mindsets, supervisory strategies","Clinical supervision is an indispensable learning process in counseling education. Research on supervisory mindsets and strategies in clinical supervision is also essential because it can advance knowledge and skills in this field (Tsai, 2012). In the last 40 years, the humanities and social sciences (including psychology and counseling) have been influenced by postmodern social constructionism (PSC; Anderson, 2009, 2012, 2013; Bob, 1999; Carlson & Erickson, 2001; Hair & Fine, 2012; Neal, 1996; Whiting, 2007; Wu, 2010). This influence led to the development of postmodern narrative and collaborative approach (PNCA) therapy. PNCA supervision–related studies have explored the perceived experiences of supervisees (Attridge, 2007; Hair & Fine, 2012) and assessed the effect of PNCA supervision on supervisees (Attridge, 2007; Hair & Fine, 2012; Nadan, 2020; Shachar et al., 2012; Huang, 2015). Their findings have suggested the positive effect of PNCA supervision on the learning and developmental experiences of supervisees. A literature review revealed that few studies have explored what and how postmodern supervisory mindsets and strategies are adopted during the supervision process. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to explore the supervisory mindsets and supervisory strategies adopted by a supervisor during the PNCA group–supervision process (GSP).Nine certified counseling psychologists with masters’ degrees participated in a monthly group supervision that was supervised by a senior clinical PNCA supervisor (the third author) for 8 months. During these 8 months, the nine participants did not receive any other supervision groups. Eight verbatim drafts of the GSP were collected and analyzed by grounded theory. The results indicated that the supervisor exhibited eight types of postmodern supervisory mindsets namely demonstrating appreciation, not taking things for granted, normalization, being public, practicing de-expertization, being not-knowing, practicing validation, and privileging the local knowledge. The present study revealed that the supervisor exhibited the characteristics of PSC. The aforementioned eight types of supervisory mindsets corresponded to the findings of previous studies (Behan, 2003; Carlson & Erickson, 2001; Hair & Fine, 2012; Jenkins, 1996; Kahn & Monk, 2017; Shachar et al.,2012; Sutherland et al., 2013; Ungar, 2006; Weingarten, 2016), which have reported that the characteristics of PNCA supervision include appreciating and applying the experience and knowledge of supervisees, appreciating supervisory dialogue, and maintaining an equalitarian supervisor–supervisee relationship (Carlson & Erickson, 2001; Sutherland et al., 2013; Kahn & Monk, 2017). Behan (2003) emphasized the crucial role of a supervisor in maintaining a curious attitude and being public because such behavior not only can reduce the burden undertaken by the supervisor as an expert but also promote supervisees’autonomy and expertise. Ungar (2006) also highlighted the role of the supervisor in the modeling of deconstruction and not taking things for granted. The present study also revealed that the supervisor adopted 13 types of supervisory strategies, including seven types of supervisory strategies were common adopted in every supervision approach, and six were unique to PNCA supervision. The six types of supervisory strategies unique to PNCA supervision were the exploration of unique outcomes, narrative deconstruction/externalization/naming, witnessing, teaching/sharing/modeling of PNCA philosophy and strategies, using of meaning-oriented questions and using of metaphors.This study found that the supervisor had adopted four types of witnessing-related behaviors to recognize and empower supervisees, namely the application of a supervisee’s opinion at multiple time points, application of other individuals’ perspectives in supervisee’s narration during supervision, and application of supervisor and other supervisees’ feedback. For example, the supervisor asked supervisees to recall and reflect on what they had done during the past year. The supervisor also asked supervisees to consider what’s the contributions of themselves as a counselor from the perspective of the client and what the client might say regarding this topic. The supervisory strategy of witnessing enhanced the development of the supervisee’s previously absent (but implicit) narrative, unique outcomes, and subjective inner-expertise knowledge.The supervisor who participated in this PNCA GSP also taught, shared, and adhered to the philosophies and strategies of PNCA supervision. These supervisory strategies are widely used in clinical supervision (Hair & Fine, 2012; Hsu, 2011; Shih, 2015; Stoltenberg, 2005) and aid supervisees in achieving appropriate counseling function and learning how to appropriately apply case conceptualization, processing, and personalization skills. In the present study, the supervisor also played the role of a teacher, consultant, and mentor. This observation is consistent with those of previous studies, which have proposed that supervisors need to provide instruction, guidance, direction, and feedback; these comprise specific directions and guidance for specific issues, the use of modeling and discussions to promote the skills of the supervisee, and the promotion of supervisees’ reflections through supervision (Shachar et al., 2012; Ungar, 2006; Watkins, 2017). Our study further revealed that PNCA supervision not only achieved the required functions and tasks of clinical supervision but also met the learning requirements of supervisees and promoted the well-being of clients.The present study verified that PNCA supervision is characterized by attentive listening, empathic responses and recognition, and the use of questions to encourage supervisees to reflect on themselves. This finding corresponded to those of other PSC supervision studies, which emphasized that PSC supervision incorporates attentive listening, empathic responses, and walk side by side in the supervision process (Andersen, 1987; Anderson, 2009, 2012, 2013; Carlson & Erickson, 2001; Neal, 1996; Jenkins, 1996; Weingarten, 2016; Whiting, 2007; Wu, 2017).The other seven types of supervisory strategies adopted by the supervisor are common in other supervision models; the strategies adopted were responsive–active listening, the use of positive and nonjudgmental questions, understanding the supervisee’s supervision needs, immediately checking, understanding the client’s context, reframing, and providing instructions. These seven strategies corresponded to those used in counseling and group counseling, suggesting that they are basic and entrylevel strategies and skills in counseling education. Wu (2017), Anderson (2009, 2012, 2013), and Weingarten (2016) have all highlighted the key role of the supervisor in implementing attentive listening, empathic feedback, and walk side by side and promoting a supervisee’s reflection and reconstruction during the supervision process. Guindon (2010/2012) also suggested that immediately checking and reframing are basic skills for providing help in counseling. This finding suggested that the seven strategies can be applied in supervision theories and models, and they can be treated as basic and entry-level helping skills in the context of counseling and supervision.Research on effective and common supervisory strategies applied in supervision theories and models is essential for counseling education because it promotes the application of knowledge and skills that enhance the development and learning experiences of supervisees.PSC-based PNCA supervision emphasizes attentive listening, empathic responses, and positive connotations in relation to supervisees. The goal of PNCA supervision is to generate benefits for both clients and supervisees. With respect to clients’benefits, the goals of PNCA supervision are dissolving the dilemma of the supervisee and promoting the acquisition of knowledge and skills associated with PNCA conceptualization, processing, and personalization. With respect to supervisees’benefits, the goals of PNCA supervision are reanchoring the counseling values, beliefs and theories of the supervisee; promoting the emergence and development of the supervisee’s absent (but implicit) narrative, unique outcomes, and subjective innerexpertise knowledge; and enhancing the supervisee’s self-efficacy and counseling effectiveness (Wu, 2019). The findings of the present study can be used as a reference to aid the application of PNCA supervision in clinical supervision and counseling education. However, the present study had some limitations and its results must be cautiously interpreted and applied. First, the present study was a qualitative-only study. Second, the supervisees who participated in the study were all licensed psychologists with at least 2 years of practical experience, and all of them participated voluntarily. Third, researchers’ mindsets might have influenced the research results during the analysis phase. Future studies can examine the experiences of supervisee with respect to PNCA supervision, the effect of PNCA supervision on supervisees, and whether the patterns or characteristics of PNCA supervision vary depending on the participants involved. For example, whether the patterns or characteristics of PNCA supervision vary when it is applied to master’s level part-time practicum students versus master’s level full-time internship students? With such knowledge, we can better understand the characteristics of PNCA supervision and enrich postmodern supervision.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2918,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Counselors’ Difficulties and Strategies When Intervening in Relational Bullying Incidents,"Su-Fen Tu, Wen-Chang Teng, Yi-Feng Chen","bullying intervention, relational aggression, relational bullying, counseling strategies, counseling difficulties","Relational bullying is a prevalent phenomenon that is commonly observed among peers in schools, particularly middle schools. The victims of relational bullying are affected by severe social and psychological adjustment problems; moreover, these interpersonal adjustment problems continue to affect them in subsequent phases of their lives. Studies have revealed an association between reductions in school bullying incidents and the presence of teachers who are sensitive to relational problems and capable of providing competent class management as well as positive behavioral and emotional support and praise to students. Preventive programs that emphasize the development of students’ empathy, prosocial behaviors, emotional management, and interpersonal social skills were demonstrated to be effective in reducing relational aggression. Studies have examined the interventions and counseling provided after the occurrence of bullying events and discovered that school counselors mostly worked with victims through individual and group counseling; however, these studies have also suggested the establishment of teacher–parent collaborations to stop bullying. Purpose: This study explored counselors’ difficulties and strategies when they intervene in relational bullying incidents in schools. Method: In total, 27 school counselors (comprising 22 females and 5 male counselors) were interviewed in a group setting. The participants had an average age of 34.5 years and an average of 8.31 and 5.59 years of teaching and counseling experience, respectively. They all had experiences of intervening in relational bullying incidents, with 11.1%, 18.9%, 51.8%, and 14.8% of them having intervened in one, two, three, and four incidents, respectively. The participants were divided into five groups, and a group interview lasting 2 to 3 h was conducted for each group. The guidelines for the group interviews comprised four items, namely (i) relational intervention experience (i.e., sharing of experiences in intervening in students’ relational bullying incidents), (ii) identification experience (i.e., how incidents were identified or confirmed as relational bullying incidents), (iii) strategies (i.e., sharing of intervening strategies applied to involved students [instigators and victims], bystanders, and other individuals in response to the occurrence of incidents), and (iv) difficulties (i.e., sharing of difficulties encountered when intervening in incidents and the methods used to overcome these difficulties). Data analysis was conducted in the form of template analysis, and the draft of the first group was used to establish the initial category template, after which the categories were amended or revised per the data generated during the analysis. The kappa coefficient for the raters was determined to be .84 after two rounds of adjustments. A group of 10 school counselors were invited to evaluate the draft’s credibility, completeness, closeness, and applicability; on a 7-point scale, the raters gave scores ranging from 6.33 to 6.67. Results: The difficulties encountered by counselors who intervened in relational aggression incidents were as follows: (i) Difficulties in identifying relational bullying: The counselors reported that they felt constrained and confused when they had to identify the roles of the individuals involved in relational bullying incidents. An involved student might claim that he or she felt ostracized by his or her classmates even though no one had acted aggressively against them, or they might have been the instigator. In other cases, students might have repeatedly acted aggressively against each other but still claim that they were bullied. (ii) Difficulties in conducting individual counseling: The counselors experienced difficulties in aiding victims, particularly those who lacked social skills and were resistant to change and those who resisted counseling because they felt that they were being blamed. Furthermore, a few counselors were also concerned that their countertransference might hurt the involved students because of the frustrations that they experienced when interacting with stubborn victims. Another challenge was counseling bullies; these instigators had interpersonal advantages and general adopted the avoidant strategy of denial. Some accused instigators also claimed that they felt hurt and became defensive during counseling sessions. (iii) Difficulties in establishing systematic collaboration: First, the counselors reported that they conducted group counseling with the involved classes but encountered difficulties because they had no previous experiences of interacting with these classes. Second, collaboration with homeroom teachers was another challenge because many of these teachers lacked the skills to identify relational bullying in their classes and provide guidance in response to relational bullying incidents; in some cases, the situation was made worse by the use of inappropriate interventional strategies. Moreover, working with parents could be a complex matter; occasionally, these parents were overprotective or too emotional involved in their children’s relational problems. Some parents also insisted on verifying the actual roles of the individuals involved in an incident; thus, they neglected the psychological well-being of the involved students. The strategic component of the results indicated that an integrated interventional strategy that incorporated both individual and systematic interventions was optimal for addressing relational aggression events involving relational bullying incidents. The counselors reported that they were able to alleviate the students’ trauma when they set aside the concept of identifying the instigator or investigating the incident and accepted the volatile nature of interpersonal relationships among adolescents. When providing counseling to clients who were victims, a counselor empathized and respected a client’s subjective perception of the incidents and devoted their efforts toward assisting client’s interpersonal skills’ development and relational restoration with peers. The counselors revealed that empathic listening and rapport relationships were especially important when working with aggressors; also, if a teacher, possibly with the help of a counselor, could make good use of aggressors’ interpersonal power, the whole class would have benefited from this effort. In addition, a counselor could apply mediation to resolve conflicts if agreement could be reached between both parties. When intervening in bullying incidents, counselors reported that the most frequently used strategy was a team-based one that involved homeroom teachers, heads of discipline, and special education teachers. Counselors could establish collaborative relationships with homeroom teachers when they could provide emotional support to these teachers who were coping with problematic relational bullying incidents in their classes. Most counselors conducted group counseling to release tension in a class, implementing antibullying psychoeducation programs, and promoting empathic understanding for victims with special needs (such as autistic or hyperactive students). When working with difficult parents in relational bullying incidents, the counselors revealed that empathizing with parents was the general practice because these parents often received biased information from their children. The counselors worked with parents by maintaining continual home–school communication, providing the parents with consultation services using multiple resources, or implementing these two measures simultaneously. Although enforced counseling was recommended for inclusion in school rules as a legislative means of ensuring involved students’ have access to counseling when their parents or guardians are resistant to providing consent, the present study indicated that counselors must overcome multiple types of difficulties and gain the support of parents or guardians to achieve optimal counseling effectiveness. Conclusion/Suggestion: First, both individualized and systematic interventional strategies must be applied for relational bullying incidents. Second, although role identification is essential for preparing mandatory reports, school counselors should focus on the humane roles and functions of a counselor rather than those of an investigator when intervening in bullying incidents. Therefore, we recommend that school counselors concentrate on the relationship traumas of the involved students and aid them in developing their interpersonal skills and restoring their relationships. Furthermore, school counselors must improve their systematic collaboration and consultation abilities to work with teachers and parents when intervening in such incidents. Finally, we recommend the establishment of a community resource center to provide consultation services to school counselors and staff when they encounter relational bullying incidents because they often consider identification and intervention as problems.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2919,53.1,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Problem Solving and Example-Based Learning on Cognitive Load and Performance,Yi-Hung Huang,"discovery learning, comparing solution method, cognitive load theory","The 12-year Basic Education Curriculum guidelines emphasize the importance of discovery activities in the curriculum.Therefore, methods of implementing discovery-based learning in the classroom and achieving effective teaching goals have become a major topic for current teachers. Alfieri et al. (2011) conducted a meta-analysis of 164 studies and reported that allowing students to only perform pure discovery activities may be detrimental to learning; however, assisted discovery learning, including feedback, worked examples, and self-explanation prompts, can benefit learning. Studies on assisted discovery learning, have provided empirical results regarding the integration of problem solving and example learning. These studies have indicated that learners who cooperate in solving problems before receiving direct teaching or seeing examples perform better than those who first receive direct teaching or examples and then solve problems. However, the findings of these studies only demonstrate that solving problems cooperatively and then studying examples is a more favorable approach than studying the examples individually and then practicing solving the problems. With inconsistent experimental conditions (i.e., cooperative vs. individual), distinguishing the effects of the variables of the timing of problem solving and the type of example learning on teaching effectiveness is impossible. Sweller and Paas (2017) also indicated that most of these studies did not control variables appropriately and that they changed multiple variables simultaneously. Therefore, the experimental designs of these studies were fundamentally flawed and could not isolate the effects of specific variables. Although some studies on the integration of problem solving and example learning have analyzed the learning process from the perspective of cognitive load theory, this is only a theoretical discussion. Studies have not conducted actual measurements of the cognitive load perceived by the learner during the learning process (Kapur & Bielaczyc, 2012; Loibl & Rummel, 2014). In addition, for studies in which the experimental participants were elementary school students, only one item was used to evaluate cognitive load, such as “How much effort did you use in the process of learning just now?”; in general, this cognitive load could not be accurately measured (Huang & Shie, 2016 ; Wong et al., 2012). Furthermore, if the intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads perceived by the learner during learning cannot be known, cognitive load theory cannot be used to effectively analyze the learner’s cognition and information processing during learning (Leppink et al., 2013). Therefore, this study excluded the effect of cooperative learning and allowed learners to learn materials individually to avoid confounding variables. The “basic quantity and comparative quantity” unit of mathematics was used for the experiments in this study. The researcher conducted an experiment to study the effects of two factors on learning outcomes and perceived cognitive load: Problem-solving timing (problem solving first or reading an example first) and the type of example (comparative example or problem-solving practice). The multidirectional scale developed by Leppink and van den Heuvel (2015) was used to measure intrinsic and extraneous cognitive loads perceived during learning, and an objective reference value was used for the learning outcome to observe germane cognitive load. Therefore, on the basis of cognitive load theory and the relevant literature, the research questions verified in this study were as follows: 1. Does the timing of problem solving and the type of worked-out example affect the intrinsic, extraneous, and overall cognitive load when students learn to draw line segments, operate line segments, and solve reference and comparison quantity problems?2. Does the timing of problem solving and the type of worked-out example affect the test scores when students learn to draw line segments, operate line segments, and solve the reference and the comparison quantity problems? The researcher first used two factors (timing of problem solving and type of worked-out example) to design an experiment involving three exercises: drawing line segments, operating line segments, and solving a reference and comparison quantity problem. Second, 105 sixth-grade children were randomly assigned to four groups for the experiment: reading examples first then comparing examples (group 1), solving problems first then comparing examples (group 2), reading examples first then practicing problem solving (group 3), and solving problems first then practicing problem solving (group 4). After each exercise was completed, the cognitive load scale was used to measure the students’ perceived intrinsic load and extraneous load. Finally, a learning test was used to evaluate the students’ learning performance in drawing line segments, operating line segments, and solving the reference and the comparison quantity problems. The answers to the first three questions of the cognitive load scale indicated the perceived intrinsic load, and the answers to the last three questions indicated the perceived extraneous load. Factor analysis with the timing of problem solving and type of worked-out example as independent variables and the test scores and cognitive load indicators as the dependent variables was performed. The two-factor multivariate analysis revealed no significant interaction effect between the timing of problem solving and the type of example on the students’ perceived cognitive load or the three test scores. The analysis also indicated that the perceived intrinsic load of the students who solved problems first was significantly higher than that of the students who read examples first when solving the reference and the comparison quantity problems. The overall perceived cognitive load of the students who solved problems first was also significantly higher than that of those who read examples first when operating line segments and solving the reference and comparison quantity problem. No significant difference was observed between the comparative example condition and the practicing problem solving condition in the students’ perceived intrinsic, extraneous, or overall cognitive load No significant difference in test scores was observed between the different problem-solving timing conditions in the three tests; however, the test scores of the students who had seen a comparative example were significantly higher than those of the students who practiced problem solving when drawing line segments. Four sets of materials were designed to study the effects of problem-solving timing and worked-out examples on learning effectiveness and perceived cognitive load. The researcher used the multidimensional cognitive load scale to successfully measure the students’ perceived intrinsic load and extraneous load. When the experimental conditions were controlled for and the cooperative learning variable was excluded, the experimental results were determined to be consistent with those of previous research regarding worked examples (Kalyuga et al., 2003; Renkl & Atkinson, 2003). The learning performance of group 2 was not higher than that of group 1. Different learning examples may be suitable for learning different types of knowledge. Therefore, on the basis of the findings of this study, the researcher proposes the following strategies for educators. First, because of the nature of problem-solving activities, learners may perceive a higher cognitive load; therefore, learning materials suitable for the level of learners should be carefully designed when implementing a strategy that involves solving problems. Second, the comparison of examples is suitable for learning conceptual knowledge, and practicing of problem solving is suitable for learning procedural knowledge. Finally, when designing teaching materials for comparative examples, educators should add incorrect examples to the materials. The correct and incorrect examples should be compared, and the learner must be asked to explain why the incorrect examples are wrong; doing so can repair the learners’ knowledge and enable them develop the correct concept.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2897,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Do Students Admitted to Universities Through Different Channels Have Differences in Self-Regulated Learning and Academic Performance? Comparison of Students From the Multi-Star Project, Individual Application Channel, and Exam-Based Channel","Nellie S. Cheng, Jin-Long Wang","multi-channel entrance system, self-regulatory learning, academic performance","For decades, the Taiwanese university admission system consisted of only one channel—the Joint College Entrance Examination—for admitting students into universities. This single-channel system received widespread criticism; for example, it was criticized for imposing enormous stress on students and for preventing students from exploring their interests and alternative career paths. Consequently, the multichannel entrance system was launched in 2002 to replace the single-channel paradigm and provide multiple options for students to be admitted into universities. Among the available admittance channels, most high school students are admitted into universities through three main channels: the multistar project, individual application channel, and exam-based channel. This study focused on these channels. These three channels were developed to meet distinct policy goals, and each challenge has unique procedures and criteria. The multistar project was designed to reduce the urban–rural gap and promote the communization of senior high schools. Therefore, students with good academic performance, regardless of the standing of their high school, have favorable chances of entering the university of their choosing. The individual application channel involves a similar application process to that in the United States and European countries. This channel requires students to prepare a personal portfolio supporting an application to a specific program. In-person interviews are usually mandatory during the process to facilitate proper consideration by the program faculty; compared with the other two channels, this channel is considered more effective at matching students’ interests and competences with a department’s selection criteria. Finally, the exam-based channel largely duplicates the old system of the Joint College Entrance Examination in which students list their desired programs and the exam score is the only criterion used to determine whether a student is qualified. All students are required to take the General Scholastic Ability Test in late January or early February; however, for students who choose the exam-based channel, an additional and considerably more difficult exam (Advanced Subjects Test, AST) is required in early July. Students who choose the multistar project channel are informed of their results in late March. The interview process for the individual application channel takes place in April, and students are informed of their results in May. For students who use the exam-based channel, the admission results are announced in early August. This study used self-regulated learning characteristics to interpret differences in academic performance. Among the three entrance channels, the multistar project channel emphasizes the high school GPA (grade point average), requiring applicants to maintain a high level of academic performance. The exam-based channel requires students to prepare for an additional and more difficult exam, requiring students to maintain their study skills and efforts longer. During this preparation time, students who choose the two other channels already know their admission results and are relieved of this burden. The researchers hypothesized that students who choose these two channels (multistar and exam-based) would have better self-regulated learning characteristics and academic performance in college. However, because the individual application channel is the most effective at matching students and programs, the researchers also hypothesized that students who choose the individual application channel would have stronger academic motives for their chosen majors in college.The study sample comprised 4542 college students, of whom 513 were admitted through the multistar project channel, 1929 were admitted through the individual application channel, and 2100 were admitted through the exam-based channel. Student data were collected through the student affairs system of a single university in Taiwan. The researchers adopted the nine variables of the framework of self-regulated learning proposed by Sitzman and Ely (2011). The researchers first explored the internal structure of the variables and used them to derive four self-regulatory factors, namely goal momentum, self-regulatory mechanism, academic motivation, and engagement time, which were then used to test the hypotheses. Goal momentum, including self-efficacy, goal setting, and metacognitive strategies, represents the process of planning, executing, and monitoring progress toward goals. Self-regulatory mechanism, including time management, learning environment structure, attention, and attribution, reflects an individual’s self-regulating actions during the learning process. Because academic motivation and engagement time could not be categorized into a common factor, they were added to the regression analysis individually. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to derive a predictive model of how these self-regulatory factors predict academic performance (GPA in college). Finally, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to test the hypotheses: first, that students from the multi-star project and exam-based channels would outperform students from the individual application channel in terms of self-regulatory characteristic variables (except academic motivation) and academic performance, and second, that students from the individual application channel would have more academic motivation than would students from the two other channels.The results demonstrated that among the four self-regulatory learning factors (goal momentum, self-regulatory mechanism, academic motivation, and engagement time), goal momentum and engagement time significantly predicted academic performance; this pattern appeared to be consistent across the three groups of students. Goal momentum and engagement time differed among the three groups. Specifically, as hypothesized, students admitted through the multistar project and exam-based channels outperformed those admitted through the individual application channel. Students admitted through the multistar project channel had higher academic performance than did those admitted through the exam-based channel, and in turn, students admitted through the exam-based channel had higher academic performance than did those admitted through the individual application channel. However, academic motivation (including the evaluation of their values and interest for their majors) did not differ among the three groups. The individual application channel aims to enhance self-exploration among students, and in theory, it best matches students and programs; nevertheless, the results of this study do not support this proposition. In addition, the study revealed that students admitted through the individual application channel had a slightly higher rate of changes in majors (p < .01 in chi-square analysis) than did those admitted through the two other channels. Thus, contrary to the policy goal of matching students and programs, the students admitted through the individual application channel did not have stronger academic motivation, and a higher percentage of these students changed their majors. The individual application channel is the most commonly employed channel to admit students into universities in the United States and European countries; the Ministry of Education in Taiwan intended for this to be the dominant or even only channel for future admissions. The results of this study did not support the superiority of the individual application channel in the Taiwanese higher education context as measured by GPA; instead, the results for this channel were less favorable regarding students’ self-regulatory characteristics and academic performance.The establishment of the multichannel entrance system was revolutionary and upheld a noble goal of both allowing students to better tailor their self-development and career paths and giving universities more power to choose suitable students for their departments. However, the revision of public policies to meet the needs of society takes time and multiple adjustments. A new version of the multichannel entrance system will be implemented in 2022; a notable improvement is being negotiated based on negative feedback regarding the current version. For example, students who choose the multistar project and individual application channels have nearly 3 to 4 months of “nonstudying time” because their application procedure ends earlier. The new version has shortened this non-studying time by revising the timetable. For any policy to improve, it must include a dynamic feedback and revision process. A policy aimed at correcting one problem may create a new set of problems. Although some channels are designed to match students with applied programs, the traditional approach of students choosing programs based not on their interests but on the reputation of the university might still be common. This unexpected behavior during application to programs might have affected the channels through which students enter a program. Additional qualitative studies aimed at identifying the means through which students select an entrance channel are required to further determine effective means of designing policy to better persuade students to choose a major based on their own interests and competence.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2898,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Integrating Technology in Mathematics Instruction on Grade School Academic Achievement in Taiwan: A Meta-Analysis,"Yuen-Kuang Clif Liao, Yung-Hsin Chen","meta-analysis, integrating technology, Taiwan students, mathematics, academic","Jonassen (2000) suggested that learning with information technology (IT) involves three stages: learning from computers, learning about computers, and learning with computers. The development of learning with IT in Taiwan, beginning with computer-assisted instruction, loosely follows these three stages (Chang, 2002). Integrating IT into instruction is the first stage of learning with computers. Previous meta-analyses (Cheung & Slavin, 2013; Demir & Basol, 2014; Hartley, 1977; Li & Ma, 2011; Slavin et al., 2008, 2009; Slavin & Lake, 2008; Rakes et al., 2010; Sokolowski1 et al., 2015; Young, 2017) regarding the effectiveness of integrating IT into mathematics instruction (ITMI) have reported positive effects compared with nonITMI classes; effect sizes (ESs) were 0.07–0.9. These meta-analyses also concluded that variables such as publication year, publication type, learning stage, research design, intervention duration, technology type, assessment tool, instructional approach, and mathematics topic might influence the overall ES. A total of 19 meta-analyses investigating the effects of integrating IT into student learning in Taiwan have been performed; however, none of these studies were specifically focused on mathematics.In this study, we performed a meta-analysis to synthesize existing research regarding the effects of integrating IT with mathematics instruction on the academic achievement of elementary and secondary school students in Taiwan. We searched the National Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations in Taiwan, Airiti Library, Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature System, Scopus, EBSCOhost, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases for relevant studies by using keywords “math,” “technology,” “computer,” and “achievement” and gathered 282 studies (with 20,190 participants). We then transformed the quantitative data into ESs. After the calculation of the ES for each study, six studies with unusually large ESs were excluded in further analyses (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). Thus, the total number of studies was 276.We used the meta-analytic approach suggested by Borenstein et al. (2009), Hedge and Olkin (1985), and Lipsey and Wilson (2001). The ES was defined as the mean difference between the treatment and control groups divided by the pooled standard deviations. The criteria for inclusion of studies were as follows: (1) Studies must compare the effects of ITMI and traditional instruction (TI) on student academic achievement in mathematics; (2) participants must be elementary or secondary school students; (3) the research design must include treatment and control groups, and the treatment group must receive treatment that involved integrating IT into instruction; (4) studies must provide adequate quantitative data for both treatment and control groups so that the ES could be estimated; (5) the number of participants for both ITMI and TI groups must be over 15; studies were excluded if the overall participants were less than 30; (6) the study participants must be Taiwanese students; (7) studies must be published between 1993 and 2019.On the basis of previous meta-analyses, the moderating effects of 13 variables were investigated. These variables were classified into three categories: (1) research characteristics, including learning stage, topic in mathematics, type of publication, and year of publication; (2) research methods, including study design, instructor bias, reliability of assessment tools, number of treatment class sessions, and sample size; and (3) research design, including the instructional approach for the treatment group, learning device for the student, method of integration, and timing of integration. Hedges’ g was applied for ES calculation. If studies provided only an F-ratio value or a t value, equivalent formulae were used. In addition, the homogeneity test presented by Borenstein et al. (2009) was used to aggregate and analyze the ESs for all 276 studies. The significance of the mean ES was evaluated by its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). A significantly positive (+) mean ES indicated that the results favored the ITMI group, whereas a significantly negative (−) ES indicated that the results favored the TI group. The results of this metaanalysis revealed that the overall mean ESs were 0.32 (95% CI = 0.30-0.35, z = 24.31, p < .0001) and 0.35 (95% CI = 0.310.39, z = 17.54, p < .0001) for the fixed-effects model and random-effects model, respectively. An effect is said to be small when ES < 0.2, medium when ES ≈ 0.5, and large when ES > 0.8 (Cohen, 1992). The results indicated that integrating technology into mathematics instruction had a significant small to medium positive effect compared with TI on the academic achievement of Taiwanese students. Moreover, the homogeneity test was significant (QT = 582.37, p < .0001), indicating that the findings did not share a common ES. A series of moderator analyses were then performed. The analysis results revealed that 10 of the 13 moderating variables selected in this study had statistically significant effects on the overall mean ES. The findings were as follows: (1) The mean ES was higher for elementary school students than high school students. (2) Elementary school students had a higher mean ES for the topics “Number and Quantity” and “Geometry” than did junior high students, but junior high students had a greater mean ES for “Algebra” than did elementary school students. (3) Journal articles had higher mean ES than did unpublished papers. (4) Studies published in 2004–2009 had higher mean ES than did those published in 2010–2014. (5) Studies that applied a pretest–posttest control group design had higher mean ES than did those that applied a quasiexperimental design. (6) Studies with small sample sizes had a higher mean ES than did those with large sample sizes. (7) Studies with less than 15 overall class sessions had a higher mean ES than did those with more than 15 class sessions. (8) Individual learning had a higher mean ES than did whole-class or small group learning. (9) Studies using immediate response system learning devices had a higher mean ES than did those using traditional paper and pencil or mixed devices. (10) Integrating technology in class had a higher ES compared with integrating technology before class or after class. In this meta-analysis, Funnel plot, Rosenthal’s (1979) fail-safe Ns and Orwin’s (1983) fail-safe Ns were applied to examine publication bias. The Funnel plot indicated that the studies were distributed symmetrically. Rosenthal’s and Orwin’s fail-safe Ns were 5580 and 8653, respectively—higher than the critical value of 5K+10. The results of all three methods suggest that there was no publication bias. On the basis of these findings, the implications of this meta-analysis are outlined as followings: (1) Education planners in Taiwan should provide adequate funding supporting ITMI and should encourage elementary and secondary school mathematics teachers to implement ITMI in their classes, particularly for students who require remedial instruction; (2) education planners in Taiwan should encourage mathematics educators to develop instructional programs, teaching methods, and learning materials for ITMI classes; (3) fewer than 15 ITMI class sessions have the strongest effects; and (4) future meta-analyses should examine the effects of varied instructional approaches (e.g., collaborative learning, problem-based learning, project-based learning, and self-regulated learning) alongside ITMI. Finally, this study is the first meta-analysis to focus on the effects of technology integration into mathematics instruction on the academic achievement of Taiwanese students. By examining empirical research on this topic, this meta-analysis provides research-based evidence of the positive outcomes of using technology in mathematics classes as well as how those effects are influenced by moderating variables. The findings provide education policymakers and mathematics teachers with valuable insights into methods of improving mathematics achievement.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2899,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Challenges of Cooperative Learning in Taiwan: Strategies for Improving the Effectiveness of Cooperative Laerning,"Hsiu-Ling Lin, Sheng-Ling Chang, Hsiang-Yi Wu","successful teachers, cooperative learning, teaching strategies","Cooperative learning is one of the most innovative teaching methods developed in the past 20 years. Numerous primary and secondary school teachers in Taiwan use this method, but they face many practical challenges. Of the many teaching methods that have been proposed to increase students’ learning motivation and efficiency, cooperative learning has been relatively successful in Taiwan. Cooperative learning involves asking students to cooperate in a group to achieve one or more specific learning goals (Chang, 2003). Most classrooms in junior and elementary schools in Taiwan follow traditional teaching methods, which involve one-way, teacher–student instruction. By contrast, cooperative learning encourages students to take control in the learning process. Cooperative learning elevates students’ learning interests, willingness, and achievement through group cooperation (Johnson & Johnson, 1994). Thus, numerous studies (Chang, 2005; Wang & Chang, 2003) have demonstrated the positive results of applying cooperative learning in Taiwanese classrooms. Many such studies have focused on demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of cooperative learning or examining the concept of cooperative learning in a Taiwanese context.Few studies have proposed methods for successfully applying cooperative learning. Applying cooperative learning is challenging for teachers because of its dynamic and unpredictable nature. Typically, teachers who employ cooperative learning methods must group students according to their strengths and characteristics and design appropriate tasks to achieve the overall learning goal of the lesson.Moreover, teachers guide students to allocate and share learning responsibilities and instruct group members to communicate and support each other during the learning process. The entire teaching process requires fully understanding each student’s ability and potential, which further requires managing the interactive process and interpersonal conflicts among students. Few Taiwanese teachers have shared experiences of successfully applying cooperative learning by using teaching materials prepared in advance. Cooperative learning is a challenging teaching method that can often be frustrating, which leads teachers to avoid implementing it.This study explored the most common challenges involved in implementing cooperative learning in classroom settings. In addition, this study identified effective and successful strategies that can help teachers succeed in implementing cooperative learning. Accordingly, this study was divided into two parts. First, the potential challenges of cooperative learning were identified through surveys and interviews with 30 teachers who had experiences using cooperative learning in elementary or junior high schools. Second, practical strategies were determined through surveys and interviews with 12 teachers who had successfully applied cooperative learning in the classroom.Cooperative learning challenges were defined as challenging situations that occur during the cooperative learning process. All challenging situations were categorized into three stages of learning, namely early, middle, and late. Through calculation of the frequency that challenging situations arose in each stage, situations representing the typical challenges of cooperative learning were identified. First, during the early stage, the typical challenge was that students were unable to conduct a smooth discussion immediately after groups had been formed. For example, team members did not like or did not want to discuss the learning topics, did not want to state their opinions, or could not clearly understand other members’ speech. Second, during the middle stage, the typical challenge was that students were unable to work together when teamwork was required. Specifically, the team could not effectively assign work to each member, or some team members did not agree with how the work was assigned, which caused conflicts among team members. Finally, in the late stage, the typical challenge was that students could not finish their work. For example, team members could not summarize and conclude their work effectively, could not reach a consensus, or did not sufficiently understand the group responsibilities and the importance of sharing credit for the work.In the second part of the study, the strategies that experienced teachers used to overcome these challenges were examined. Five basic strategies were identified: (1) Teachers demonstrate how team members should trust one other; (2) team members help each other and give positive feedback; (3) team members divide responsibilities; (4) team members communicate efficiently and draw conclusions; and (5) teachers encourage team members to share the results and credit for the work. These strategies can help bypass the typical challenges observed in the three cooperative learning stages. In each stage, all strategies or most of them could be identified. However, only two strategies (which accounted for the majority of the effective solutions developed to overcome the challenges observed in each learning phase) were investigated further in each stage.The results indicated that in the early stage, teachers must intervene in group discussions and demonstrate how team members should trust one another to overcome challenges during discussions. This strategy is crucial because most students in Taiwanese classrooms are accustomed to the one-way teaching method, which may make them hesitant to participate in discussions. However, when the teacher is actively involved and facilitating the discussion, students feel safer and are more willing to participate in discussions. The other critical strategy in the early stage was teaching team members how to properly help other team members during the discussion, which included giving positive feedback and clarifying discussion topics together.The results indicated that in the middle stage, solving interpersonal conflicts is essential for overcoming challenges involving teamwork. To successfully implement this strategy, teachers must continue to encourage team members to support each other (as in the aforementioned strategy) and help the group effectively allocate their work responsibilities. Teachers must monitor how tasks are assigned in the group because many unnecessary interpersonal conflicts can arise because of different workloads or because some team members want to avoid taking responsibility.Finally, the results indicated that in the late stage, teachers required two strategies to overcome the challenges involving concluding work. The first strategy involved helping team members efficiently communicate to reach a consensus and draw a conclusion. Within this strategy, teachers must manage their time effectively because students often waste time on aimless discussions or arguments. In addition, the group is expected to reach a consensus, and their conclusion is a critical index for teachers to evaluate whether the cooperative learning approach was successful. Therefore, the key strategy in the late stage is for teachers to actively facilitate efficient communication among groups. The second strategy is for team members to be encouraged to share credit for the work. Learning to share credit for group results and appreciate being recognized as a team can help students understand the aims of the entire cooperative learning experience, which may promote their participation in the next cooperative learning activity.Furthermore, the results of the first and second part of the study were combined to create a “cooperative learning challenges and key strategies for practice” flowchart, which illustrates the practical challenges of cooperative learning and the strategies Taiwanese teachers can used to mitigate these challenges.This study identified the difficult situations and challenges involved in three stages of the cooperative learning process. The results herein can help teachers address these challenges before substantial difficulties arise. In addition, this study provides effective strategies for addressing these challenges. The results, including the flowchart, can serve as a reference for teachers to determine effective strategies for addressing the challenges involved in different stages of cooperative learning. However, this study had two main limitations. The sample size was insufficient, and only teachers were surveyed and interviewed, which may have influenced the cogency of the study. Future studies should include data from more diverse resources to ensure that evaluations of cooperative learning practices are accurate.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2900,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Development and Testing of Early Primary School Students Multiple Self-Regulation Scale in Word Problem Solving,Chia-Hua Hsu,"multiple self-regulation, word problem solving, scale, learning guidance","The introduction (purpose and literature review), method, results and conclusions of this research are described as follows.As a response to Taiwan’s education reform (12-year basic education curricula established by the Ministry of Education), learning guidance requirements, research practicality experience, and the limited attention of primary school lower grade students, this study developed the primary school lower grade students multiple self-regulation scale (PSLGS-MSRS). This Likert-type rating scale is used as a learning guidance instrument to assess self-regulation learning ability in combination with self-regulation learning componential and content analyses of addition and subtraction word problem solving (WPS) in primary school lower grade students. In addition, the PSLGS-MSRS incorporates the core competencies defined in the 12-year basic education curricula established by the Taiwan Ministry of Education, which include A2 systematic thinking and problem solving in spontaneity dimension A (elementary education stage). On the basis of the results on the PSLGS-MSRS, learning guidance programs were promoted to determine the feasibility of this study. To develop the PSLGS-MSRS, this study analyzed self-regulation and metacognition ability in combination with WPS experience to ascertain students’ experiences learning how to address certain problem types and assess their problem-solving performance. The main focus of this research is presented as follows. First, the status and discrimination power of the PSLGS-MSRS was measured. Second, the validity of the PSLGSMSRS was measured. Third, the reliability of the PSLGS-MSRS was measured. Fourth, the WPS ability of various individuals was measured according to their performance on the PSLGS-MSRS. Fifth, functions applicable to the learning guidance of the PSLGS-MSRS in terms of the WPS ability of various individuals were explored. The ability component of self-regulation learning in WPS was divided into two facets, namely general and executive self-regulation, and four batteries, namely forethought, self-reflection, performance control, and executive verification.In the general self-regulation facet, the content was summarized and integrated from three sources. First, the first and third phases of the self-regulation three-phase cycled model from Zimmerman (2013) were analyzed (i.e., forethought and selfreflection, respectively). Second, the self-regulation phases and area frameworks from Pintrich (2004) were analyzed (i.e., forethought and activation, monitoring, control, response, and self-reflection). Third, the stages of the self-instruction process cycling model developed by Caliskan and Sunbul (2011) were analyzed (i.e., setting goals, considering thematic knowledge, and planning how much time to spend on learning). These concepts were summarized into forethought and self-reflection batteries involving the processes of general metacognition and self-regulated operations in mathematical problem solving.In the executive self-regulation facet, the content was a summarization and integration of material from three sources. First, the cognitive and metacognitive framework for mathematical problem solving developed by Garofalo and Lester (1985) was analyzed (i.e., orientation, organization, execution, verification, and evaluation). Second, the three stages of the self-instruction process cycling model developed by Caliskan and Sunbul (2011) were analyzed (i.e., monitoring learning, verifying the results, and discarding useless strategies; selecting a new strategy; and modifying and implementing the new strategy). Third, the cognitive and metacognitive integrated process model for mathematical problem solving developed by Montague (2008); Montague et al. (2011); and Peltier and Vannest (2016) was analyzed (i.e., checking (evaluation), self-instruction, self-questioning, self-monitoring, and reflection). Finally, the second phase of the self-regulation three-phase cycled model from Zimmerman (2013) was integrated (i.e., performance control). These concepts were summarized and integrated into performance control and executive verification batteries involving the processes of executive metacognition and self-regulated operations in mathematical problem solving.For data collection, the PSLGS-MSRS was combined with assessments of previous experience and two-step WPS tasks involving addition and subtraction. Therefore, learning content was also analyzed. The content of the two-step word problems involving addition and subtraction was based on problems from different versions of mathematics textbooks published by different textbook companies for first and second grade students in Taiwan. Next, analyses of the ability component and content were conducted to analyze self-regulation learning and the semantic schema involved in the two-step word problems involving addition and subtraction. After an expert review, the overall results were used to compile and develop the PSLGS-MSRS and the assessments of previous experience for the two-step word problems involving addition and subtraction.To ensure homogeneity of the learning content and students’ school experiences, the participants were 602 second graders from Chiayi County and Chiayi City in Taiwan and were selected through purposeful cluster sampling. All participants were tested with the PSLGS-MSRS combined with the assessments of previous experience for the two-step word problems involving addition and subtraction. The data were divided into two clusters for random cross-validation statistical analyses. The statistical analysis methods and measures used were descriptive statistics, a repeated-measures t-test, the Pearson productmoment correlation, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients, composite reliability, multivariate analysis of variance, η2 effect size, the Roy–Bargman stepdown multivariate analysis of variance, and simultaneous confidence interval. All statistical analysis data were processed using IBM SPSS and Analysis of Moment Structures. In addition, the data were evaluated and classified into different clusters. Next, the characteristics and attributes of each cluster were identified, and the corresponding profiles were elucidated to organize the learning guidance program and suggestions for instructional strategies. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses produced numerous factor structures matching the onefactor dimension (WPS multiple self-regulation learning), two facets (general and executive self-regulation learning), and four batteries (forethought, self-reflection, performance control, and executive verification) of the self-regulation learning analyses. The KMO (Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin) value, variance proportions of factor extraction, and the model fitness were positive. The reliability analysis produced a positive α coefficient, and the composite reliability was positive. Regarding the item analysis, the critical ratio and item total correlation were strong, regardless of whether it was for a single item, a subscale, or all items. General and executive self-regulation learning abilities (i.e., forethought, self-reflection, performance control, and executive verification batteries) in WPS multiple self-regulation learning were significantly different among individuals with different WPS performance. Next, the Standardized T score of self-regulation learning ability was classified on the basis of the scores of low-performance students (bottom 27%); different characteristics and learning guidance directions were identified. The student performance profiles of different clusters were used to elucidate the main points and programs of learning guidance. On the basis of these results, the following conclusions were drawn. First, the validity of the PSLGS-MSRS was favorable, which reflected the measured construct structures of self-regulation. Second, the reliability of the PSLGS-MSRS adequately reflected the construct dependability of the self-regulation measurements. Third, the PSLGS-MSRS effectively discriminated the measured performance of individuals with different self-regulation abilities. Fourth, the performance of individuals with different WPS abilities differed significantly according to practical measurements of general and executive self-regulation performance. Fifth, differentiated functions of different learning guidance needs were identified from the PSLGS-MSRS results of individuals with different WPS abilities. Finally, on the basis of these conclusions, the PSLGS-MSRS is verified to be a valid, practical, and effective instrument for assessing self-regulation learning.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2901,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Relationship Between Perceived Social Support and English Academic Achievement Among Adolescents: The Sequentially Mediating Effects of Grit and Learning Engagement,"Sz-Chin Chen, Huey-Jiuan Chen","social support, grit, learning engagement, English academic achievement","In light of the crucial role of adolescence as a transitional stage of physical and psychological development and concerns regarding school learning during this time, educators have devoted their efforts to exploring the factors affecting adolescent development. Among all of the contextual factors, social support has been proven to promote students’ development and academic achievement (Vollet et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2011). Several researchers have further indicated that social support from different sources offers unique contributions (Song et al., 2015; Wentzel et al., 2016) and may offset each other in some circumstances (Chen & Chien, 2020). Therefore, this research, which is based on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, both separately and collectively considers parent, teacher, and peer support to provide additional empirical evidence of the relationship between social support and academic achievement.In addition to academic achievement, engagement has been considered the core element of motivation, which represents the quality of students’ participation (Skinner et al., 2009). Compared with academic achievement, learning engagement places more emphasis on the learning process, which encompasses students’ behavioral, cognitive, emotional, and agentic involvement (Fredricks et al., 2004; Reeve & Teng, 2011). Instead of disengagement, Skinner and his colleagues (2008) highlighted disaffection, which involves the maladaptive motivational states of learning. Numerous studies have suggested that engagement is associated not only with learning achievement but also with physical and mental health (Jang et al., 2016). More importantly, researchers have indicated that learning engagement and disaffection are not innate but rather the product of personal traits and contextual factors (Buhs et al., 2018), which implies that potential for academic success is potentially malleable. Thus, the current study suggests that students’ engagement can be increased through social support, which can also reduce disaffection, and that academic achievement is positively related to engagement and negatively related to disaffection.Recently, “grit” has emerged as a significant predictor of success (Duckworth et al., 2007). Although certain educational policies that have been implemented have included teaching methods for promoting the development of students’ grit, whether grit predicts academic achievement remains unclear. Several studies have indicated that grit reduces the risk of disaffection and effectively improves academic achievement (Datu et al., 2016a), whereas other studies have indicated that grit has little explanatory power in terms of academic achievement (Steinmayr et al., 2018). Several researchers have suggested that this difference may be caused by the perception of grit as either domain general or domain specific (Muenks et al., 2017). Duckworth (2016) elaborated that having grit implies not a dedication to all scopes of knowledge and activity but rather a focus on a particular long-term goal that a person has a passion for. Thus, the current study adopted the domain-specific perspective with the aim of clarifying the relationship among social support, grit, engagement, and academic achievement.In the current study, we explored the relationship between social support and English academic achievement among adolescents in upper secondary education and examined the mediating effects of grit and learning engagement. Hence, in terms of adolescents’ prior English achievement in the Comprehensive Assessment Program for junior high school students (the entrance exam for senior high school in Taiwan), we explored the sequentially mediating effects of grit and learning engagement–disaffection on perceived social support and English academic achievement, respectively. On the basis of the theoretical framework, the current study was designed to achieve the following aims: (1) clarify the current status of adolescents’ perceived social support, grit, learning engagement–disaffection, and English academic achievement and determine whether sex, school type (vocational–high school), or grade (freshman–junior) affects any of the aforementioned variables; (2) explore the relationship among social support, grit, learning engagement–disaffection, and English academic achievement among adolescents; and (3) examine the sequentially mediating effect of grit and learning engagement–disaffection on perceived social support and English academic achievement in terms of prior English academic achievement.Through stratified convenience sampling, 850 students (301 male and 549 female) were recruited from senior high schools and vocational schools in Taiwan. All participants completed the revised Social Support Scale, the Learning Engagement Scale, the Grit Scale, and an original English achievement test. We quantitatively analyzed the data using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, Pearson correlation analysis, and sequential mediation analysis. The results indicated the following: (1) senior high school students exhibit significantly higher learning engagement, have higher levels of grit, and perceive higher levels of teacher support than do vocational school students. (2) Freshmen (tenth graders) are significantly more engaged in learning and perceive significantly more parental support than do junior students (eleventh graders). (3) Male students are significantly more disaffected in learning than female students are. (4) Female students perceive significantly more peer support than male students do. (5) Social support, grit, engagement, and English academic achievement among teenagers are positively correlated with one another, whereas disaffection is negatively correlated with social support, grit, and English academic achievement. (6) Parental, teacher, peer, and overall social support have positive effects on English academic achievement. (7) Grit and engagement have sequential mediation effects on social support and English academic achievement. (8) Grit and disaffection sequentially mediate the relationship between social support and English academic achievement both positively and negatively. On the basis of these findings, the current study provides suggestions for educational practitioners and offers directions for future research.The findings of this study reveal the importance of parents, teachers, and peers in collaboratively building a positive learning environment to support adolescents’ development. Moreover, because of the crucial role of grit in adolescents’ learning, fostering grit to increase learning engagement and reduce learning disaffection is key for adolescents. In addition, both engagement and disaffection warrant attention. In this study, most adolescents exhibited a high level of agentic disaffection; these passive learners urgently require more attention. Furthermore, this study confirmed that support from different sources provides unique contributions. Support from parents and teachers affects adolescents’ learning engagement and disaffection more significantly than other types of support do. The results indicated that support from older people plays an essential role in adolescents’ development.In future studies, the distinctiveness of the participants’ microsystem should be considered; accordingly, instruments should be properly modified to enhance construct validity. Although studies have primarily highlighted social support from parents, school teachers, and peers, several participants in our study indicated that they received more support from other family members, cram school teachers, or other peers. Moreover, assessment tools should correspond to participants and their living areas to ensure the value of the research. During adolescence, teenagers try to escape from parents’ protection and strive for independence. Whether perceiving more social support might cause opposite outcomes and compromise students’ self-identity is worthy of discussion. However, Datu and colleagues (2017) accounted for cultural differences, supplementing “adaptability to situations” as the third factor of grit. Future studies can modify their assessment tools according to these considerations and perform cross-cultural comparisons. Researchers can collect multiple types of data or long-term data to improve content validity and substantiate empirical evidence. Because this study adopted a self-report inventory, the data were vulnerable to personal response and social desirability bias. Although this study revealed a sequential mediation effect, the total effects were not substantial. Future studies can further explore other mediators to enrich theoretical knowledge on academic achievement and motivation theory. Upper secondary education is the first encounter that teenagers in Taiwan have with the decision-making aspects of different school systems. The study results indicated that vocational school students have lower levels of grit and engagement and lower English academic achievement than senior high school students do. We expect additional studies to examine the upper secondary education system to provide more practical advice.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2902,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effect of Micro-Courses on Learners’ Attention and Memory Retention,"Zih-An Chen, Po-Sheng Huang","attention, fragmented course, learning retention, micro-course, traditional online course","With the development of science and technology, the generation and spread of knowledge has accelerated. Peoples’ attention spans have decreased as intelligent technological devices have been developed. In addition, modern people continue to receive excessive amounts of information due to the high frequency of Internet use, but a large amount of information cannot be effectively stored in the brain (Small et al., 2009). Scholars have claimed that, given the massive amounts of information and the learning style of digital natives, designing effective learning units that avoid cognitive overload and optimizing students’ learning patterns have become important issues in education (Fyfe, 2016; Wang & Fan, 2016).Micro-learning is a new type of learning based on micro-content and micro-media. It was first proposed by Martin Lindnerin 2006. Micro-learning is a general term for all short and small learning models, and it is not limited to any form. Microcourses for micro-learning were proposed by David Penrose, a senior instructional designer in the United States (Wen & Zhang, 2015). He defined a micro-course as a form of curriculum with short films. A previous study noted that the length of the video is related to the participation rate of learners; that is, the shorter the video length, the higher the participation rate (Guo et al., 2014). The short-film characteristics of micro-courses likely increase the focus of learners, thereby increasing their participation rate. Some of the early conventional online courses were derived from the digitization of in-person courses, and the online videos lasted for approximately 40 to 50 minutes, which would make it difficult for learners to maintain their attention (Wen & Zhang, 2015). Therefore, scholars have divided the long-term online course videos into small-scale fragmentary course videos. This increased learning retention effects (e.g., Cheng et al., 2014), showing that attention plays an important role in online video learning.In summary, micro-courses are characterized by short videos, and their content is more streamlined compared with conventional online courses and small-scale fragmentary courses. The use of short films helps students to maintain attention in the learning process, improves learner participation, and enhances learning retention. The development of micro-courses is of great importance in the current learning environment due to the rapid increase in information and the advancement of media technology. However, past studies on micro-courses have focused on learners’ affective attitudes toward microcourses, including learning motivation and learning satisfaction (e.g., Frydenberg & Andone, 2016; Yu, 2016) or have surveyed willingness to use micro-courses among teachers (e.g., Fang & Liu, 2017). Rigorously designed experimental studies examining the learning process for micro-courses are lacking; studies evaluating the learning effectiveness of micro-courses are required.This study explored the attention and learning retention effects of micro-courses featuring simplified content. Based on the course segmentation and total length, three types of courses were designed. In this study, “conformity”, a topic in social psychology, was the subject of the course. A conventional online course video of approximately 24 minutes was produced (traditional course group); this video was then cut into four fragmented course videos of approximately 6 minutes each according to theme units (fragmented course group), and a micro-course video of approximately 9 minutes was produced after by condensing the original material (micro-course group). Attention and learning retention were compared between these three groups. This study adopted an experimental design. In total, 90 college students were recruited as participants and randomly assigned to one of the three groups (traditional course, fragmented course, and micro-course). Approximately 3 to 6 participants who were assigned to the same group watched the video together. Before the experiment, participants were reminded that mobile phones and other communication devices must be turned off during the class.The experimental procedure was divided into two phases. At the beginning of the first phase of the formal experiment, participants in the traditional course group watched the video of 24 minutes with no break. Participants in the fragmented course group watched the four 6-minute videos with a 1-minute break between each video. Participants in the micro-course group watched the 9-minute video without any breaks. When they had finished watching the film(s), participants in the micro-course group were allowed to rest for 1 minute, after which they completed questionnaires.The results of this study showed that (1) participants in the fragmented course group had higher performance in the attention recognition test than participants in the traditional course group. Moreover, participants in the micro-course group reported higher levels of attention than those in the traditional course group. (2) No significant difference was found in the learning retention effect between these three groups. However, in further analysis, compared with the traditional course group and fragmented course group, the learning retention effect in the micro-course group increased in the later stages of the course.The qualitative data showed that although the three groups of participants all indicated that their attention gradually declined as the course video progressed, they paid attention when introducing real-life cases. However, these three groups of participants reported diverse reasons for attention changes. Participants in the traditional course group reported that the video included too much information, with no room for distraction. In the fragmented course group, although the length of the course was the same as that of the traditional online course, participants were allowed rest periods in between. Some participants reported that during the rest period, they could recall and reorganize what they have learned and could refocus their attention. Some participants in the micro-course group reported that their attention can be maintained during the learning process. In addition, based on the qualitative data from participants, the average time of video that most participants were willing to watch was approximately 10–15 minutes. Few participants could pay attention to videos more than 30 minutes. Moreover, all three groups of participants mentioned that the inclusion of real-life events in the design of the course would be helpful for their comprehension. The presentation of vivid animation and images in the course is not only interesting but also helpful for improving memory.The results of this study imply that through well-designed course content, even a short online learning video can achieve the same learning effect as a longer online learning video. It also allows learners to maintain a higher level of attention in the learning process. In other words, compared with the courses with long online videos, the micro-course could yield greater learning efficiency. Therefore, when designing online learning videos in the future, teachers should use the format of welldesigned micro-courses. By shortening the learning time and reducing individuals’ attention loads, micro-courses can achieve the same learning effect as courses with long videos.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2903,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationships Between Speech Perception, Phonological Awareness, and Speech Production in Preschool-Age Children with Speech Sound Disorder","Hsin-Yu Chien, Huei-Mei Liu","phonological awareness, speech perception, speech production, speech sound disorder, categorical perception","According to the definition of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, in children, speech sound disorders (SSDs) are defined as speech errors that persistent even after a certain age. Studies have shown that children with SSDs may have problems with phonological perception and phonological awareness in the preschool stage. Some studies have suggested that when treating phonological abnormalities in children, training for speech perception and phonological awareness may also improve treatment effectiveness. However, at present, studies examining the relationships between speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production of children with SSDs are lacking. To develop an effective intervention plan for children with SSDs, the relationship between speech output and speech processing-related variables should be determined. This study systematically examined the correlations between the speech production of children with SSDs and their levels of speech perception and phonological awareness to provide empirical evidence for improving clinical intervention design.By using speech processing models, this study inferred the possible reciprocal relationships between speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production. Children develop speech perception abilities (such as basic abilities to discriminate and identify speech sounds) in the early stages of development. This basic speech perception ability affects their abilities of speech production and of phonological awareness (e.g., building phonological representations and manipulations). The development of phonological awareness would improve the fineness of speech perception abilities, which in turn affects the capacity of speech production. Moreover, the perceptual and motor feedback provided based on the speech production ability in preschool children may also promote the development of speech perception and phonological awareness in these children. Although the reciprocal relationships between speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production in children with typical development or children with SSDs have not been consistently demonstrated in the literature, speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production are hypothesized to have mutual influence in children with SSDs during preschool ages.This study examined the relationships between speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production in preschool children with SSDs. Participants were 46 Mandarin-speaking children aged 5 years (39 boys and 7 girls) with SSDs and without any other sensory or developmental disabilities, such as intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, or hearing impairment. Their nonverbal IQ was higher than 80 on the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-Fourth Edition (TONI-4). Their language comprehension was also more than −1.5 standard deviation on the scandalized language test. Several self-made computerized and standardized tests were used to measure their speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production abilities. For speech perception, pure tone discrimination, speech discrimination, and categorical perception assessments were conducted. For phonological awareness, assessments of rhyme judgment, initial sound judgment, tone judgment, and syllable deletion were designed. For speech production assessment, we used the Articulatory and Phonological Test for Mandarin-Speaking Children to assess individual children’s percentage of correct word production. In addition, the speech samples elicited from the conversation, comic strip cards, and storybooks were collected and analyzed to index the percentage of correct consonants for individual children. Correlation and multiple regression analyses (including path analysis) were used to examine the relationships among these three speech-related abilities as well as the ability of speech perception and phonological awareness to predict speech production in Mandarin-speaking children with SSDs.After controlling for age, language comprehension, and nonverbal IQ, correlations were observed between the speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production of children with SSDs. Most measures of speech perception and phonological awareness were significantly correlated; however, partial correlations were found between the measures of speech perception and speech production. For example, the identification slope of consonants and tones was significantly correlated with the speech production ability, but pure tone identification was not correlated with speech production. Speech production was only correlated with syllable deletion, but not with other indexes of phonological awareness (i.e., rhyme judgment, initial sound judgment, and tone judgment). Furthermore, the results of multiple regression analysis showed that the identification slope of consonants, tone perception, and syllable deletion had explanatory power for speech production. That is, the speech perception and phonological awareness abilities at the syllable level could predict the variance of speech production. Among the predictive factors, the identification slope of speech was the most powerful predictor of speech production. In path analysis with speech production as the dependent variable, the categorical perception of consonants and tone had direct predictive power for speech production.This study revealed that after controlling for age, language comprehension, and nonverbal IQ, the speech perception sensitivities of consonants and tones (especially the phonetic identification of categorical perception) and phonological awareness (i.e., syllable deletion) of children with SSDs were significantly correlated with their speech production at 5 years of age. Among them, categorical speech identification had direct predictive power for speech production, showing that this ability has important influence on speech production, and this result indicates that children with SSDs may have inferior abilities of speech perception and phonological awareness.This study analyzed the phonological processing ability of children with SSDs, and the results are similar to the previous hypothesis for the normal development of children’s phonological processing; that is, speech perception ability affects speech production ability, and phonological awareness ability affects speech perception ability. The improved phonological awareness ability may increase the fineness of speech perception, which in turn affects the speech production ability. The perception or articulation feedback provided during speech production also promotes the further development of speech perception and phonological awareness. Overall, a close interaction exists between the three speech-related abilities as described above.The phonological processing capabilities covered in this research include speech perception and phonological awareness; however, phonological processing should include other aspects (such as phonological working memory). Therefore, future studies should explore other phonological processing abilities of children with SSDs to gain a comprehensive understanding of the phonological causes of SSDs. In addition, currently, two major approaches of intervention exist for children with SSDs, one based on motor skill training and the other based on language processing training. The articulation-based training model focuses on motor skill training for speech production, and this training mainly involves teaching the correct articulatory movements of individual speech sounds at the speech production level. The language processing–based model emphasizes the buildup of correct phonological representation of the complex phonological system for children with SSDs to correct inaccurate speech representations and speech errors. According to the results of this study, training involving both “listening” and “speaking” is important and should be conducted as an early speech intervention for children with SSDs. In terms of listening training, establishing phonetic discrimination (i.e., distinguishing the same or different speech sounds), identification (i.e., defining the specific speech sound category), and phonological awareness (i.e., detecting specific phonemes) may facilitate speech production in preschool children with SSDs. The establishment of correct phonological representations for children may facilitate precise speech production. In terms of speaking training, children should be supported to observe the position and movements of the speech organs during articulation training. The feedback of correct speech production movements can also facilitate children’s speech perception abilities. Overall, the developments of speech perception, phonological awareness, and speech production are intercorrelated. Speech perception and phonological awareness training should be combined when implementing speech interventions for children with SSDs to improve their speech sound production.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2904,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Does Assessing the Quality of Primary Research Matter? A Meta-Analysis of Analogical Instruction-Induced Changes in Students’ Science Concepts,"Jin-Chang Hsieh, Yi-Ching Chiu","analogy instruction, conceptual change, meta-analysis, quantitative research synthesis, quality assessment of primary research","As evidence-based education evolves, an increasing body of evidence has highlighted the issue of constructing high-quality indicators in the synthesis of quantitative research. However, what is considered optimal remains unclear and a topic of debate. Numerous researchers assess the single indicator of primary research such as the publication, pretest performance, reliability and validity, and sample size. This approach can result in bias. Therefore, this study proposed alternative quality indicators to replace the single indicator with suitable evidence synthesis. Research on analogy instruction was integrated through a systematic review and meta-analysis, and the effects of analogy instruction were explored through quantitative research synthesis.With respect to literature reviews, document retrieval targets journal articles, master’s theses, and doctoral dissertations on the basis of references to relevant retrospective studies. Regarding analogy instruction, systematic literature collection and positioning are performed to avoid missing relevant articles and causing sampling bias. Moreover, the participants included in the present study ranged from preschoolers to elementary, junior high school, vocational high school, and university students. The analogy instruction–related topics discussed included single analogies, analogy bridges, and multiple analogies. However, comments on or introductions of analogy instruction and scientific concept learning performance were excluded from analysis, as were articles on the development at different stages and other irrelevant topics. Because quantitative meta-analysis was conducted, qualitative studies were also disregarded, as were publications that failed to provide the information required for calculating effect sizes.In meta-analyses, Hedges’ g is used as a measure of the effect size of standardized mean differences (Hedges, 1982). Owing to pretest–posttest differences in data provided by different institutions, the effect sizes can be roughly classified as those of the mean raw score and the mean-covariate adjusted score (Morris & DeShon, 2002; WWC, 2020b). When the information on adjustments to pretest data, including statistics from analysis of covariance, adjusted means, and standard deviations, was provided, the effect size of the mean-covariate adjusted score was used. According to WWC recommendations (2020b), if this information was not provided but other data (e.g., pretest and posttest means and standard deviations) were and the pretest– posttest assessment tools were consistent, difference-in-differences was used. To account for pretest–posttest correlations, difference-in-differences adjustment was performed. When no pretest data were provided or only posttest-related statistics (e.g., from analysis of variance) were provided, the effect size was calculated from the mean-raw score.Regarding the integration effect of analogy instruction in promoting students’ scientific concept learning performance, a medium immediate effect size of 0.59 was obtained. The delayed effect size was reduced to 0.39 (medium).Regarding the moderators of analogy instruction, single analogy regression failed to reach significance, but the p-value was 0.08, that appeared to become more significant or nearly significant. The effect size of analogy instruction for the elementary school students was 0.88, whereas that for students in junior high school and above was 0.52, constituting a significant difference.With regard to seeking more appropriate indicators for assessing the quality of primary research, three indicators are proposed herein: baseline equivalence of the pretest, reliability and validity of assessment tools, and sample size. For baseline equivalence, the effect size was not significantly different regardless of whether the baseline equivalence of the pretest was even. Regarding the selection of effect calculations, even if the attrition rate was excessively high (more than 10%) or the pretest difference was greater than 0.5 standard deviations, they were classified as nonconforming indicators. By this standard, as long as statistics from covariate analysis or pretest and posttest data were provided, the effect size was estimated by using the mean score after covariate adjustment. This appeared to compensate for both types of possible differences, which in turn led to nonsignificant results.Regarding the reliability and validity of assessment tools, the regression coefficient β was −0.57 (pβ < 0.0001). The effect size of 1.06 was large. The result indicates that obtaining a large effect size is simple if the reliability and validity of assessment tools are not addressed. Regarding the sample size, the regression coefficient β for the basic number of participants was −0.81 (pβ = 0.003), demonstrating that a favorable effect size of 1.36 could be easily obtained for small-scale studies on analogy instruction. As Slavin (2008) noted, small-scale studies are likely to obtain extremely positive or extremely negative result.In terms of meeting the three indicators, primary research considering all levels of validity had a medium effect size of 0.49. Similar results were obtained regardless of the quality assessment method used. The effect sizes of the studies that did not meet the quality assessment standards exceeded those of the studies that did, indicating that the effects of analogy instruction in primary research may be overestimated if quality assessment is not considered.Significant effects were observed for both analogy instruction approaches and learning stages. The regression coefficient β values were 0.27 (pβ = 0.03) and −0.41 (pβ = 0.01), respectively. For the elementary school learners, the effect size of 0.77 for single analogies was large. The effect size for approaches other than single analogies was larger (1.04). For single analogies and nonsingle analogies among students in junior high school and above, the effect sizes were 0.36 and 0.63, respectively—roughly in the upper and lower intervals of medium effect sizes. Therefore, different analogy instruction topics had different effect sizes for students at different learning stages, with better results for topics other than single analogies.Regarding publication type, multiples analysis was performed on moderators of the analogy instruction topics and learning stages. A tendency toward positive effects was observed. When publication type is controlled and two moderators are examined at the same time, publication type had little influence on analogy instruction.Regarding the baseline equivalence of the pretest, the comparable regression coefficient β values were 0.07 (pβ = 0.72) and 0.03 (pβ = 0.89) to the analogy instruction topics and learning stages, respectively. Neither were significant. According to the study design and the information provided, the initial selection of an appropriate calculation scale can facilitate the adjustment of the comparability of the baseline equivalence of the pretest.When all three indicators (i.e., baseline equivalence, reliability and validity of assessment tools, and sample size) were met, the mentioned conditions exerted impacts on analogy instruction topics. When the conditions were not fulfilled, the influence of other moderators or the effects of analogy instruction could be misestimated or overestimated, respectively.When all three indicators (i.e., baseline equivalence, reliability and validity of assessment tools, and sample size) were met, the mentioned conditions exerted impacts on analogy instruction topics. When the conditions were not fulfilled, the influence of other moderators or the effects of analogy instruction could be misestimated or overestimated, respectively.The conclusions are as follows: First, analogy instruction had an overall positive effect. Second, when the impacts of quality indicators were not controlled, single analogies were less efficient than other analogy instruction topics, such as multiple and bridging analogies. Furthermore, the elementary school students performed better, especially when they received instruction on topics other than single analogies. Finally, publication type is not a favorable indicator in the quality assessment of primary research because of mixed impacts with publication bias. However, alternatives can be well defined both theoretically and empirically through the examination of baseline equivalence, the reliability and validity of assessment tools, and the establishment of basic sample size requirements.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2905,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"The Relationship Among Mothers´ Meta-Emotion Philosophy, Mother-Adolescent Emotion Flexibility, and Adolescents´ Internalizing and Externalizing Behaviors","Yih-Lan Liu, Yi-Chen Tong","dynamic system, emotional flexibility, metaemotion philosophy, internalizing and externalizing problematic behavior","Adolescence is a developmental phase marked by changes in the mother–adolescent relationship. From early to middle adolescence, the number of mother–adolescent conflicts increases and maternal support and power decrease. Changes in the mother–adolescent relationship are accompanied by changes in the range of emotional states involved in these dyadic interactions (De Goede et al., 2009). From a dynamic system perspective, dyadic variability is regarded as an essential factor in relationship changes that allows for the reorganization of interaction patterns (Fogel, 1993). High levels of dyadic flexibility might facilitate relationship change adaptations in mother–child dyads as well as the provision of opportunities that arise during adolescence (Granic et al., 2003). By contrast, low levels of dyadic flexibility might be associated with problems in the mother– child relationship (Granic et al., 2007). Furthermore, dyadic variability in mother–adolescent interaction has been found to be related to both emotion regulation competence and behavioral adjustment in adolescents (Lougheed & Hollenstein, 2016; Van der Giessen et al., 2013).According to Gottman et al. (1996), how mothers interact with their children is strongly affected by their emotional socialization philosophy. In that study, the researchers introduced three types of parental metaemotion philosophy: emotion coaching, emotion dismissing, and emotional dysfunction. Yeh (2002) added a fourth type in a study of emotional uninvolvement among Taiwanese parents. Studies have demonstrated that children who grow up with supportive, emotioncoaching parents tend to have better self-regulation skills and fewer externalizing problems (Shortt et al., 2010; Stocker et al., 2007). By contrast, children with emotion-dismissing parents were more likely to have internalizing and externalizing behaviors as well as emotional regulation difficulties (Gottman et al., 1996). Through a dynamic system approach, this study explored the relationships among the flexibility of mother–adolescent emotional interactions, maternal metaemotion philosophy, and adolescents’ internalizing and externalizing problematic behaviors. The first objective was to examine whether mothers’ metaemotion philosophy was related to internalizing and externalizing behaviors in their adolescent children by way of emotional flexibility in mother–adolescent interactions. The second objective was to identify the characteristics of attractors in the system of emotional interaction between mothers and adolescents.Participants comprised 118 pairs of junior high school students and their mothers from northern and central Taiwan. Data collection proceeded either at a home visit or at the university’s laboratory room. The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee for Human Subject Protection. Observation and questionnaire completion lasted approximately 120 minutes. Observation was performed on the basis of methods used in the study by Hollenstein and Lewis (2006) on dyadic parent–child interaction patterns in conflict-resolution situations. Before observation, the participants were instructed by a research assistant to resolve the conflict as best as they could within 6 minutes. After a discussion on their resolution, the participants completed a series of questionnaires, namely the parental meta-emotion philosophy scale (Yeh, 2002), child behavior checklist (Achenbach, 1991), and the youth self-report (YSR; Achenbach, 1991). Two trained assistants rated the emotional interactions within the pairs on the basis of the specific affect coding system (Gottman & Krokoff, 1989). State space grid analysis was conducted on the flexibility of emotional interactions between mothers and adolescents. The flexibility was defined by the combination of three flexibility indexes: total number of unique cells, total number of cell transitions, and dispersion. Adolescents’ internalizing and externalizing behaviors were defined by using a combination of the mothers’ reports on the CBCL and the adolescents’ reports on the YSR.The results of the mediation analysis indicated that emotional flexibility did not mediate the relationships between maternal metaemotion philosophy and internalizing or externalizing behaviors. However, emotion-dismissing parenting predicted externalizing behaviors. To further examine whether internalizing and externalizing behaviors varied with emotional flexibility, the adolescent participants were divided into high flexibility and low flexibility groups (based on one standard deviation above and below the mean, respectively) and subjected to a t test. The adolescents in the high flexibility group exhibited lower levels of externalizing behaviors. To identify the characteristics of the attractors in the emotional interaction system, a winnowing procedure was conducted. Two significant attractors were established: mother negative engagement–adolescent negative disengagement and mother positive engagement–adolescent positive engagement.The results did not support the mediation hypothesis—that is, maternal metaemotion philosophy did not predict internalizing or externalizing behaviors by way of emotional flexibility. This can be partly explained by the relatively low variances of the flexibility indexes and the internalizing versus externalizing behaviors, which prevented the clarification of intervariable relationships. This might be due to the small size and unrepresentativeness of the sample. The participants, who were volunteers, might share specific characteristics. For example, they had a higher-than-average socioeconomic status; approximately 50% of the mothers had a university or graduate degree. The mothers also tended to participate actively in their children’s lives and are concerned about their children’s academic performance. Thus, coming from such a high socioeconomic family, the adolescents in this study displayed fewer behavioral problems. This may account for the similar interaction patterns observed in this study. Notably, emotional interactions were only observed in conflict-resolution situations; features of discussion topics (positive or negative), which may affect emotional flexibility, were not considered. In general, maternal metaemotion philosophy basically reflects the emotion socialization process, which is rooted in daily interactions. Given that the present observation was only 6 minutes long, we likely captured only part of the picture of emotional interactions between the pairs. In addition, we focused on emotional flexibility within mother–adolescent interactions. Maternal metaemotion philosophy might affect adolescents’ behavioral adjustment through other interaction patterns within this relationship, but these were not addressed in the study.Mother negative engagement–adolescent negative disengagement and mother positive engagement–adolescent positive engagement were identified as salient attractors in the emotional interaction system, with mother negative engagement– adolescent negative disengagement being stronger. The mothers most frequently exhibited dominant attitudes and interest, and the adolescents most frequently exhibited defensive attitudes and interest. Further examination of the videos revealed that the majority of the mothers and adolescents were interested in their conversations. However, when disagreements occurred, the mothers often asked their children to obey them in either a tough or gentle manner. In general, the adolescents responded by either staying silent or passively protesting by saying “Yes, but……” In Taiwanese society, where filial piety is strongly emphasized, even as adolescents advocate for autonomy and independence, they tend to manage conflicts with their mothers passively or avoidantly instead of aggressively.In conclusion, we investigated mother–adolescent emotional interactions from a dynamic system perspective. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate relevant topics in Taiwan through this approach. Although our findings did not support the hypothesized mediation model, high dyadic flexibility in mother–adolescent interaction demonstrated a preventive effect on externalizing behaviors. Two implications for parenting are presented as follows: First, parents should be aware of their emotional socialization practices toward their children and understand its possible impacts on their children’s behavioral adjustment. Second, parents should be more flexible but less rigid in emotional expression when interacting with their children.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2906,52.4,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Taiwanese Adolescents’ Cognition of Social Relationships: Multibackground and Multidimensional Exploration,"Rong Wang, Yue-Hua Tong, Ying-Hong Sun","taiwanese adolescents, cognition of social relationships, conceptual structure, social relationship dimensions","Research on Taiwanese adolescents’ social relationships has mostly focused on the types, qualities, and states of the relationships as well as their correlation with factors such as adolescents’ self-esteem, deviant behavior, and mental health. Relatively few studies have examined social relationships as cognitive objects to investigate their cognitive structure or dimensions. A few studies on cognition have been limited to family background or parent–child relationships and lacked attention to the whole social relationship network. How adolescents perceive their social relationships plays a crucial role in their development. Fourth, sixth, and eighth grade students are in transition periods of adolescence, during which their cognitive competence develops. Moreover, their peer relationships and friendships develop rapidly, and their relationship with their family changes. Additionally, the three grade levels span from primary school to junior high school, and the students’ social relationships may differ depending on the environment. According to the interpretation-based view and embodied cognition view, memes, living environment, and growth experience play roles in the development of adolescents and affect their cognition of social relationships. Furthermore, adolescents’ social roles change dynamically according to the situation. Social relationships are based on various dimensions, with any one social relationship having more than one dimension. Moreover, social relationships involve at least two parties, and their dimensions may be directional (e.g., self-first or other-first). Therefore, multibackground, multidimensional, and comprehensive research on the social relationships of individuals of various categories (e.g., different ages and sexes) and backgrounds is necessary. The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) to examine the cognitive structures and dimensions of social relationships among different backgrounds and the directionality of dimensions among Taiwanese adolescents and (2) to examine the cognitive characteristics of Taiwanese adolescents of different grade levels and sexes.Two studies were conducted. In the first, 35 students in fourth, sixth, and eighth grades were surveyed. They were asked to write as many relationship terms of address from family, school, and peer backgrounds as possible based on their own experience. This formed the source of the social relationship list of these Taiwanese adolescents. The lists contained 46 different terms of address under the family background, 55 under the school background, and 44 under the peer background. Subsequently, 321 students in grade 4 (9.78 ± 0.66 years, 54 boys and 43 girls), grade 6 (11.43 ± 0.55 years, 51 boys and 40 girls), and grade 8 (13.59 ± 0.61 years, 72 boys and 61 girls) participated in the formal study to categorize the relationship terms of address from each background. After completing the categorization , participants wrote the categorization criteria they used for each background. The number of categories and the criteria of each participant were recorded in SPSS 23.0 to obtain descriptive statistics. Next, the specific categorization criteria of each participant for each background were organized into a dissimilarity matrix. Then, the matrices were superimposed by grade and sex. Nine matrices were obtained for the grade levels, with each grade having three matrices (family, school, and peer backgrounds), and six matrices were obtained for the sexes, with both boys and girls having three matrices each (family, school, and peer backgrounds). These dissimilarity matrices were input into SPSS 23.0, and multidimensional scaling was employed for statistical analysis. Three evaluators labeled the dimensions in the conceptual structures according to the multidimensional scaling analysis results, categorization criteria of the participants, and labeling in previous studies. The kappa coefficients exceeded 0.971. The second study focused on father–child, mother–child, and grandparent–grandchild relationships for family background; teacher–student and classmate relationships for school background; and classmate relationships and friendships for peer background. Dimension scales such as obligation, reciprocation, obedience, and affection were selected based on relevant studies. On a 9-point Likert-type scale, 287 students in grade 4 (9.82 ± 0.68 years, 54 boys and 38 girls), grade 6 (11.42 ± 0.54 years, 49 boys and 35 girls), and grade 8 (13.53 ± 0.60 years, 61 boys and 50 girls) rated the dimension scales of the 6 relationships for both directions (self-first and other-first). Participants’ assessments were input into SPSS 23.0. The following analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted with repeated measures on the first two factors for each of the dependent measures (obligation, reciprocation, obedience, and affection) in family and peer relationships: 3 (types of family relationship) × 2 (directions of dimension scale) × 3 (grade levels of participants) × 2 (sexes of participants) and 2 (types of peer relationships) × 2 (directions of dimension scale) × 3 (grade levels of participants) × 2 (sexes of participant). Furthermore, 2 (directions of dimension scale) × 3 (grades of participants) × 2 (sexes of participants) ANOVAs were used with repeated measures on the first factor for each of the dependent measures in teacher–student relationships. The results were as follows: (1) Taiwanese adolescents’ conceptual structure of social relationships exhibited both similarities and differences among family, school, and peer backgrounds. Affection was an obvious dimension in all three backgrounds. In addition, adult–child, generation (bei), gender, and in-law dimensions in the family background; adult– child and rank (identity) dimensions in the school background; and life context and rank (identity) dimensions in the peer background were revealed. (2) Taiwanese adolescents’ assessments of the dimension scales (obligation, reciprocation, obedience, and affection) had the following characteristics: first, the assessment degrees of mother–child relationships were all the highest among family relationships, and those of friendships were all higher than those of classmate relationships. Second, the assessments of the dimension scales exhibited directionality. The obligation of elders (teachers) to younger generations (students) was higher than that of younger generations (students) to elders (teachers), and the obedience of younger generations (students) to elders (teachers) was higher than that of elders (teachers) to younger generations (students). The affection of teachers for students was higher than that of students for teachers, but no such directionality existed in family relationships. The reciprocation of participants toward peers was higher than that of peers toward participants. (3) Grade-level characteristics were different in the categorization task and the specific dimension scale assessment. For the conceptual structures of social relationships, the sixth and eighth graders exhibited larger affection dimensions in all three backgrounds as well as a larger in-law dimension in the family background compared with the fourth graders. The eighth graders also exhibited gender dimension in the family background. The eighth graders attached greater importance to affection in the categorization task, exhibiting a higher level of cognitive development. However, in the specific dimension assessment, their assessments of affection in family relationships and of obligation in teacher–student relationships were all lower than those of the fourth and sixth graders. In terms of the directionality of dimensions assessment, the sixth graders exhibited some differences with the fourth and eighth graders. The sixth graders’ assessments of reciprocation in family relationships and assessment of obedience in teacher– student relationships exhibited more obvious directionality. For the fourth and eighth graders, assessments of reciprocation of friendships were higher than those of classmate relationships, whereas the difference was nonsignificant in the sixth grade. (4) Girls exhibited more obvious affective tropism than did boys in both macro conceptual structure and the specific dimension assessment. In terms of family background conceptual structure, girls exhibited adult–child, in-law, and affection dimensions, whereas boys exhibited adult–child, in-law, and gender dimensions. Girls’ assessments of obligation, reciprocation, obedience, and affection in teacher–student relationships were all higher than those of boys. Moreover, girls’ assessments of reciprocation and obedience in both family and teacher–student relationships exhibited more obvious directionality than those of boys. Furthermore, girls’ assessments of obligation, reciprocation, and obedience in peer relationships exhibited more obvious directionality than those of boys. (5) Taiwanese adolescents did not cognize their social relationships and the dimensions in isolation—social relationship dimensions overlapped and were interwoven. The macro cognitive structure and the specific dimension assessment exhibited both commonalities and differences, as did the cognitive characteristics of social relationships from different backgrounds as well as those of Taiwanese adolescents of different grade levels and sexes. The results suggest that multibackground, multidimensional, and multilevel research on the cognition of social relationships is necessary. Furthermore, the results verify and enrich theoretical perspectives such as dynamic–contextualist metatheory, the convoy model, relational model theory, the embodied cognition view, and the interpretation-based view. This research also has crucial supplementary significance in the research field of Taiwanese adolescents’ social relationships.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2894,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Application of Psychologist-led, School Counselor-led, and Peer-led Eating Disorder Prevention Interventions in High School Girls",Yu-Ping Chen,"high-school girls, eating disorders, preventive intervention, peer-led","Most eating disorder intervention programs outside Taiwan are based on quasiexperimental designs. They use school classes or small groups as intervention units and compare short- and long-term effects. Intervention outcomes revealed that, compared with other groups, participants with cognitive dissonance exhibited significantly greater reductions in risk factors for eating disorders and bulimic symptoms (Stice et al., 2006). Although many intervention programs have claimed to be effective, those yielding more significant outcomes have had certain research design features, such as being specially designed for eating disorders, being interactive rather than directive, being multiunit rather than single unit, recruiting mainly female participants older than 15 years, and using interventions conducted by professional counselors (Stice et al., 2007). In Taiwan, the early prevention of eating disorders remains in its infancy, and few studies have focused on prevalence surveys, risk factors, related influencing factors, or sporadic case reports. Current survey results in Taiwan indicate that the prevalence of individuals at a high risk of eating disorders is between 8.6% and 17.5%, and the younger the individual, the higher the prevalence is, highlighting the importance of early prevention. Remarkably few studies have been conducted on interventions to prevent eating disorders in Taiwan; therefore, based on past research findings, the present study explored the effects of on-campus prevention programs for eating disorders. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to test the effects of three different interveners (i.e., psychologists, school counselors, and peers) using the same intervention program to reduce the risk factors for eating disorders in high-school girls and (2) to compare the effectiveness of the three interventions. Three high schools were recruited to participate in the first stage. We selected groups at high risk of eating disorders among ninth-grade students by using the Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT-26). A total of 1886 high-school girls from the three schools were divided into 21 scores using the EAT-26, and 160 high-risk girls (8.5%) were selected. During the second stage, 66 at-risk female students agreed to participate in the experimental group and were assigned to either the psychologist-led group (PCG), school counselor-led group (SCG), or peer-led group (PEG); furthermore, 78 students were recruited for the control group. The experimental group participated in the Prevention Program for Eating Disorders (PPED), a well-tested eating disorder prevention program that involves four 90-minute group sessions. The program mainly allowed participants to criticize the value of “skinny is beautiful,” establish concepts of correct nutrition and health, acquire skills to respond to pressure related to body image, and enhance their self-confidence. School counselors and peer leaders were required to attend a 6-hour training session to learn how to implement the program. To enable peer leaders to administer the program effectively, a systemic peer-led training program was conducted; thus, with the help of school counselors, experienced group members were able to lead a new group. The effectiveness of the program was evaluated using the EAT-26 and the Body-Image Ideas Questionnaire (BIQ). All participants were asked to complete the EAT-26 and BIQ at the end of the intervention and again at the 3-month follow-up. Compared with the controls, the PCG achieved significantly greater improvement in EAT-26 and BIQ scores for short- and long-term effects; the SCG achieved significantly greater improvement in only BIQ scores for immediate and continuous effects; and the PEG did not exhibit any significant differences in scores. Regarding the effects of the three groups on changes in BIQ scores, the PCG had a significantly greater effect than the other groups did, but no significant difference existed in the effects on changes in EAT- 26 scores. Overall, the intervention of the psychologist can significantly reduce the risk factors of eating disorders and improve the positive body image, while the intervention of the school counselor is only effective in promoting a positive body image. The intervention effect of school counselors was not as beneficial as that of psychologists, and a possible reason for this was shared by one school counselor: “…there are manuals to follow during the intervention process, but in education and training for professional development, there is not much knowledge about eating disorders and a lack of training on how to lead critical thinking, so more practical leadership experience is required to become proficient.” For the PEG intervention, the preventive effect could not be determined. The reason may be related to the younger peer leaders, less training time, fewer leaders in the group, and the special status of participants. Future implementations of the PPED should train older peer leaders, increase their training time, and enhance the training content, as previous research has suggested, by placing greater emphasis on role-playing leadership skills (Stice et al., 2009). This study proposes the following suggestions: initially, off-campus psychologists can provide 4–6 hours of training and supervision to school counselors. After training, school counselors must lead an intervention group to familiarize themselves with the PPED and recruit future PEG leaders. Then, the school can establish and continue to promote the PEG intervention to prevent eating disorders early on campus. Because peer leaders have no experience, this study suggests that groups not exceed six members and receive more than 8 hours of training and supervision. The number of leaders can be increased to three. If this works smoothly, school counselors will not need to invest excessive energy in the long term, and this model will effectively prevent eating disorders in young female students in the long term. In addition, this study differs from past intervention studies on the prevention of eating disorders. The participants not only comprised those who were dissatisfied with their body image but also those at high risk of eating disorders. Although this made the research difficult, it increased the ability to intervene for those in need and made exploring the effect of the program content on preventing eating disorders in young girls possible. This study had the following limitation: the three intervention groups spanned three schools and multiple semesters, and thus, the time of intervention, number of group members, and initial scores of group members may be different due to the above reasons; therefore, the conclusions of this study must be viewed with caution. In summary, the results indicated that with proper planning, schools at all levels can promote various prevention programs for physical and mental health, even on sensitive topics such as eating disorders. Such programs will be highly beneficial for students in terms of facilitating early prevention. Moreover, with appropriate prevention programs and training, school counselors will not only be a critical resource for preventive on-campus interventions but also key promoters of establishing peer-led groups; thus, early preventive interventions can be made sustainable. Such a prevention model based on the advantages of campuses is extremely helpful for harnessing the energy of the school system to promote student health. However, because schools in Taiwan place excessive emphasis on academic performance, the arrangement of long-term activities that fit in with schools’ routine work is difficult. Therefore, to continually promote early interventions for young people in schools, a national education policy must be fully planned and implemented.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2893,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Validation of an Agency Scale for Elementary and Secondary School Counselors,"Pei-Shan, LeeZuway-R Hong","agency, agency ability, agency behavior, school counseling, confirmatory factor analysis","Innovative assessment systems for elementary and secondary school counselors’ agency ability and agency behavior are rare. Therefore, a crucial emerging task is the development of a high-quality research tool for assessing school counselors’ agency ability and agency behavior. “Agency” refers to an individual’s capacity for rational choice in the face of external pressures such as social structures, norms, and order. It implies that an individual has a considerable degree of power and the ability to change his or her surroundings (Edwards, 2005; Lipponen & Kumpulainen, 2011). Agency is a central element of the sense of hope, and agents not only recognize that the future will be better than the present but also see themselves as a critical force for achieving it (Billett & Pavlova, 2005). Numerous studies on education and learning have explored the concept of agency as a relevant factor in promoting one’s career and lifelong learning; they have indicated that teachers’ agency not only promotes student learning but also enhances teachers’ professional development. Children and adolescents may experience various mental health problems in schools, communities, and their families, which might be linked to increased work responsibility and challenges for school counselors. School counselors must equally advocate for and access opportunities for students, help all students and their families overcome various forms of oppression and injustice, and act as change agents in the school setting.This study aimed to develop and validate an agency scale for elementary and secondary school counselors. The theoretical basis adopted by this study was social cognitive theory (SCT). Bandura (2001) proposed reciprocal determinism for subjective consciousness, which considers individual factors (P), behavioral factors (B), and environmental factors (E) to be interactive causal relationships. This study was derived from research on professional agency in the field of education; we modeled elementary and secondary school counselors’ agency in two major components, namely agency ability (P) and agency behavior (B), which are personal and behavioral factors of SCT. With reference to the literature, this study developed 19 items for a school counselor’s agency ability (SCA-A) scale and 40 items for an SCA behavior (SCA-B) scale. This study had two stages: (1) in the pilot stage, purposive sampling selection was employed to recruit 200 participants to complete the two scales for an examination of their reliability and validity. We applied item analysis and exploratory factor analysis to determine the construct validity of the two instruments. After clarification and modification, formal research tools were formed, with 17 items in the SCA-A scale and 37 in the SCA-B scale. In the formal stage, we conducted stratified, purposively sampling selection to recruit a total of 620 school counselors to complete the formal survey. We further used confirmatory factor analysis to examine the research tools’ validity. Three factors were extracted from the SCA-A scale: general self-efficacy (eight items), promotion focus (six items), and adventurous spirit (three items). The average variance extracted (AVE) was .46– .74, Cronbach’s α was .84–.90, and Cronbach’s α for the full scale was .90. Five factors were extracted from the SCA-B scale: advocacy action (12 items), agent engagement (8 items), teamwork (6 items), creative behavior (6 items), and organizational citizenship behavior (5 items). The AVE was .41– .62, Cronbach’s α was .78– .92, and Cronbach’s α for the full scale was .94. Both scales had good composite reliability, construct validity, and discrimination validity. They provided empirical evidence for promoting the quality of assessments on elementary and secondary school counselors’ agency ability and behaviors. The following essential findings provide new insights: First, both the SCA-A and SCA-B scales generally worked well; the response rate was high, most participants could understand the items, the scales exhibited adequate internal consistency, and evidence of convergent and discriminate validity was promising. This study provides a new lens on both Bandura’s (2011) self-efficacy theory and Alkire’s (2005) consideration of agent ability has benefit to organize a self-multiple model. In the past, the self-efficacy of school counselors in Taiwan has included self-awareness, helping skills, counseling experience, and communication effectiveness, focusing on counselors for a single educational level; by contrast, we found that the General Self-efficacy Scales can be expanded to different educational levels’ school counselors. Second, DeJong and DeGoede (2015) found that “promotion-focused” helpers can significantly reduce people’s crises compared with “protection-focused” helpers. By contrast, we found that three items formed a new “risk-taking” factor extracted from the original “promotion-focused” factor. This indicates that counselors being active does not necessarily mean taking risks, which provides a new lens on the concept of “prudence and seriousness” proposed in indigenous psychological research in Chinese societies. Third, agency behaviors are objective, and quantitative indicators indicate a counselor’s actions with participation by individual or collective agency. The agency behaviors of elementary and secondary school counselors encompass active actions for themselves, for the clients they serve, and for other members of the group, and these actions include advocacy actions, agent engagement, creative actions, teamwork, and spontaneous engagement. This structure of agency behavior is similar to that of Blustein et al. (2019). In addition, this study validated the concept of teamwork in our culture, the organizational citizenship behaviors explored by organizational behavior scholars, and the initiatives proposed by academic organizations related to helping others, indicating that elementary and secondary school counselors can demonstrate agency behavior in multiple ways. In sum, the SCA-B scale is more suitable than a single factor is for use in reviewing the work of elementary and secondary school counselors in terms of their agency behavior. We suggest that future studies explore relevant factors for elementary and secondary school counselors as well as research tools for measuring both in-service and preservice educational development training to enhance their professional counseling and guidance self-efficiency. Because school counselors have multiple roles and functions, they face many pressures, struggles, and challenges from multiple sectors every day. Therefore, well-educated and competent school counselors must foster sufficient agency ability and behaviors, such as personal characteristics, values, organizational atmosphere, supervisor support, and peer collaboration. This study suggests that a model of school counselor agency can be established along with the predictive paths and effects of various variables in the near future. Moreover, helpers have different stages of career development, such as beginner, postgraduate, novice professional, and experienced professional. Their agency abilities and behaviors as well as career development differ, and therefore, individual differences must be considered when designing a suitable agency curriculum for them. Finally, some limitations of the present study should be considered. First, the study scales were based on self-reported items, which might increase the possibility of the social desirability effect (Rowley et al., 2007). Therefore, future studies should apply methods other than a self-report questionnaire, such as peer ratings regarding counselors’ agency ability and behavior. Second, this study should provide additional evidence for the potential usefulness of applying the Chinese versions of the SCA-A and SCA-B scales to elementary and secondary school counselors in Asian countries for enrich global database.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2892,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Study on Reciprocal Relations among Academic Emotions, Situational Interest, and Learning Engagement","Yun-Ting Huang, Biing-Lin Cherng","reciprocal relation, situational interest, academic emotions, learning engagement, longitudinal study","In educational psychology research, researchers have highlighted problems in students’ learning. In fact, many researchers have suggested that students’ learning processes are more crucial than their learning outcomes are (Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Schraw et al., 2001). However, little attention has been paid to students’ learning activities and processes; therefore, they formed the focus of the present study. Educational psychology researchers have used learning engagement to describe behaviors in students’ learning processes (Putwain et al., 2019). Learning engagement has been defined as the degree to which students participate and engage in learning activities, and it is a critical behavior in active learning. Several studies have demonstrated that learning engagement is closely related to learning motivation, situational interest, and academic emotions (Ainley & Ainley, 2011; Pekrun & Linnenbrink- Garcia, 2012). To investigate academic emotions, researchers in educational psychology have mostly used academic emotion theory (Pekrun, 2006). On the basis of the influence of academic emotion processes, Pekrun (2006) proposed the cognitive-motivational model, which posits that academic emotions influence learners’ cognition, motivation, and engagement, thereby influencing their learning achievement. Moreover, in return, learners’ learning achievement subsequently influenced their motivation, engagement, and academic emotions, and their motivation and engagement influenced their academic emotions. Therefore, reciprocal relations exist between academic emotions and learning engagement, yet few studies have examined them. Furthermore, a close relationship exists between situational interest and students’ learning engagement (Reschly et al., 2008). Situational interest is defined as temporary interest that arises spontaneously due to environmental factors (Hidi & Harackiewicz, 2000; Renninger & Hidi, 2002). Reeve and Tseng (2011) defined student engagement as a four-dimensional concept consisting of behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and agentic aspects. Much research has found that situational interest influences students’ learning engagement (Lipstein & Renninger, 2006; Renninger & Shumer, 2002; Silvia, 2006). Some researchers found that situational interest enhanced students’ learning engagement, which in turn influenced their situational interest (Ainley & Ainley, 2011). However, relevant studies have only used cross-sectional analyses; limited studies have examined these reciprocal relations. Therefore, the present study proposed a reciprocal relationship between situational interest and learning engagement. According to theoretical and empirical research, the present study constructed an academic emotion, situational interest, and learning engagement reciprocal effect model, which focused on the reciprocal relations between academic emotions (enjoyment and boredom) and learning engagement, situational interest, and learning engagement. The present study employed a longitudinal design to examine the reciprocal relations between these variables.Data collected from a longitudinal study with seventh- and eighth-grade junior high school students (N = 643; 302 boys) from 6 schools (25 classes) in Tainan City, Taiwan, were examined. Data collection was conducted in four waves. Participants were asked to complete the academic emotions scale (enjoyment and boredom), situational interest scale, and learning engagement scale. All scales referred to the students’ Chinese classes. Attrition analyses revealed no significant differences in T1 enjoyment and boredom between partially missing (N = 43) and complete samples; a significant difference existed in T1 situational interest between partially missing and complete samples, but the effect size was small (η2 = .01). Therefore, we used 600 complete samples in the subsequent analysis. Moreover, we analyzed the sex and grade-level differences of partially missing samples. The results indicated no significant differences between boys and girls in seventh and eighth grade among the partially missing samples. Finally, the present study used a class unit for sampling (nested data), which may have entailed clustering effects. According to Meuleman and Billie (2009), a group sample size of 40 in the between-level factor structure is sufficient. Only 25 classes were involved the present study; therefore, we standardized all variables by using a class as a unit to prevent class clustering effects (Dowding & Haufe, 2018). The present study applied structural equation modeling to analyze the data by using LISREL 8.80 and SPSS for Windows 23.0. To assess the model fit, we used well-established indices such as root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) < .10, standardized root mean residual (SRMR) < .05, Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), and comparative fit index (CFI) > .95 in addition to chi-square test statistics. Data were analyzed in two steps. After a preliminary statistical analysis, we first examined descriptive statistics, sex and grade differences, and measurement invariance. Second, we examined the model fit by using two strategies: First, the reciprocal relations models were tested competitively against two unidirectional models. If the reciprocal model exhibited a better fit with the data, then the model of the present study was supported. Second, we examined the model fit and effects of all variables. Before analyzing the model, we first analyzed sex and grade differences. No significant differences existed between boys and girls in T2 learning engagement, T3 enjoyment, or T4 learning engagement. However, significant differences existed between boys and girls in T1 enjoyment, boredom, and situational interest and in T3 boredom and situational interest, but the effect size was small (η2 = .01 – .02). Moreover, no significant differences existed between the seventh and eighth grades for all variables. Hence, we did not use sex as a control variable. Second, we tested measurement invariance, which included configural, metric (weak factorial), scalar (strong factorial), and covariance. The results indicated that the boredom scale had strong measurement invariance, Δχ2 (dfs= 1–5, N = 600) = 0.40–5.30, p > .05, and the enjoyment, situational interest, and learning engagement scales had weak measurement invariance, Δχ2 (dfs = 4–20, N = 600) = 2.21–23.62, p > .05. According to Putnick and Bornstein (2016), if measurement scales indicate invariance for all variables over time, then they are suitable for longitudinal studies. First, the results of the present study indicated that the academic emotions, situational interest, and learning engagement reciprocal effect model had an excellent fit with the data χs2 (242, N = 600) = 1401.06, 1196.29, p < .05; RMSEAs = .093, .083; SRMRs = .047, .041; TLIs = .93, .97; CFIs = .98, .97). Second, the data analyses revealed reciprocal relations between enjoyment and learning engagement. Students’ T1 enjoyment enhanced their T2 learning engagement. In turn, students’ T2 learning engagement positively predicted their T3 enjoyment, and students’ T3 enjoyment enhanced their T4 learning engagement. Third, reciprocal relations existed between boredom and learning engagement. Students’ T1 boredom reduced their T2 learning engagement; in turn, students’ T2 learning engagement negatively predicted their T3 boredom, and students’ T3 boredom reduced their T4 learning engagement. Fourth, the data analyses revealed reciprocal relations between situational interest and learning engagement. Students’ T1 situational interest enhanced their T2 learning engagement; in turn, students’ T2 learning engagement positively predicted their T3 situational interest, and students’ T3 situational interest enhanced their T4 learning engagement. To conclude, the present study demonstrated reciprocal relations between enjoyment/boredom and learning engagement as well as between situational interest and learning engagement. These findings expand the evidence base for the cognitive-motivational model and further understanding of the relationships among academic emotions, situational interest, and learning engagement.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2891,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Emotional Labor Strategy Profiles and Theirs Relationship with Related Factors: From the Perspectives of the Quality/Quantity,Ying-Fen Chang,"job burnout, role identification, person-oriented analysis, emotional labor strategy profiles, organizational identification","Most studies on emotional labor strategies have adopted a variable-centered analysis rather than a person-oriented analysis. However, some scholars (Chang et al., 2018; Cossette & Hess, 2015; Hülsheger & Schewe, 2011) have contended that exploring emotional labor strategy profiles and their adaptability in real situations by using a person-oriented analysis, which can compensate for deficiencies of variable-centered analysis, has more ecological validity and practical value. Furthermore, some scholars (Chang, 2018; Vansteenkiste et al., 2009; Wang & Hanges, 2011) have demonstrated that rather than a variable-oriented analysis emphasizing the quality or quantity of variables, a person-oriented analysis stresses the quality and quantity of profiles by classifying and comparing profiles from the perspectives of quality and quantity, which can not only determine differences among profiles more meaningfully and systematically but also clarify the key reasons for differences in profiles more distinctly. Moreover, teachers perform emotional labor (Hochschild, 1983; Yin, 2015), and thus, understanding their emotional labor strategies is crucial. Therefore, this study adopted a person-oriented analysis to analyze teachers’ emotional labor strategy profiles from the perspective of quality and quantity and their relationships with antecedent variables (organizational identification and role identification) and outcome variables (job emotions, job satisfaction, and job burnout). In accordance with scholars who have used person-oriented analyses (Marsh et al., 2009; Vansteenkiste et al., 2009; Wang & Hanges, 2011), this study inferred that teachers’ emotional labor strategy profiles can be classified into four different quality/ quantity profiles: high maladaptive (surface acting) and high adaptive (deep acting/expression of naturally felt emotions) emotional labor strategies belong to the high-quantity group (high surface acting/high deep acting/high expression of naturally felt emotions); low maladaptive (surface acting) and low adaptive (deep acting/expression of naturally felt emotions) emotional labor strategies belong to the low-quantity group (low surface acting/low deep acting/low expression of naturally felt emotions); low maladaptive (surface acting) and high adaptive (deep acting/expression of naturally felt emotions) emotional labor strategies belong to the good-quality group (low surface acting/high deep acting/high expression of naturally felt emotions); and high maladaptive (surface acting) and low adaptive (deep acting/expression of naturally felt emotions) emotional labor strategies belong to the poor-quality group (high surface acting/low deep acting/low expression of naturally felt emotions). Concerning the relationships of emotional labor strategy profiles with organizational and role identification, on the basis of social identity theory (Ashforth & Mael, 1989) and past studies (Demir, 2015; Newman et al., 2016; Uzun, 2018), this study deduced that the organizational identification emphasized in Western society might predict emotional labor strategy profiles. Grounded in domestic Taiwanese research (Hsu & Huang, 2009; Hwang, 2004; Yen & Hwang, 2011) and relevant studies (Brotheridge & Lee, 2002; Hou et al., 2015; Lin & Shao, 2009), this study inferred that the role identification stressed in Eastern culture also predicts emotional labor strategy profiles. Accordingly, organizational and role identification might predict emotional labor strategy profiles.This study investigated the differences in emotional labor strategy profiles on job emotions, job satisfaction, and job burnout from the perspectives of quality and quantity. From the perspective of quantity, based on emotional labor strategy theory (Hochschild, 1983; Diefendorff et al., 2005) and conservation of resources theory (Hobfoll, 1989), emotional labor strategies are workers’ emotional regulation strategies for following emotional expression rules at work; thus, the higher the quantity of emotional labor strategies adopted, the more psychological effort is spent on emotional regulation and the more inner resources are lost, which leads to work maladaptation. Specifically, the higher the quantity of emotional labor strategy profiles adopted, the higher the degree of work maladaptation. Accordingly, the adaptive variables (positive emotions and job satisfaction) of the good-quality group might be greater than those of the high-quantity group; those of the poor-quality group might be smaller than those of the low-quantity group; those of the good-quality group might be equal to those of the poor-quality group; those of the good-quality group might be smaller than those of the low-quantity group; those of the poor-quality group might be greater than those of the high-quantity group; and those of the good-quality group might be smaller than those of the low-quantity group. Differences in emotional labor strategy profiles on maladaptive variables (negative emotions and job burnout) produced results that were the direct opposite of the aforementioned results. From the perspective of quality, grounded in the multiple dimensions of emotional labor strategies (Hochschild, 1983; Diefendorff et al., 2005), surface acting is maladaptive (poor quality), and deep acting and expression of naturally felt emotions are adaptive (good quality); thus, adaptive deep acting and expression of naturally felt emotions increase the adaptation of the profiles, whereas surface acting reduces their adaptation. Accordingly, the adaptive variables (positive emotions and job satisfaction) of the good-quality group might be greater than those of the high-quantity group; those of the poor-quality group might be smaller than those of the low-quantity group; those of the high-quantity group might be equal to those of the low-quantity group; those of the good-quality group might be greater than those of the poor-quality group; those of the good-quality group might be greater than those of the low-quantity group; and those of the poor-quality group might be smaller than those of the high-quantity group. Differences in emotional labor strategy profiles on maladaptive variables (negative emotions and job burnout) produced results that were the direct opposite of the aforementioned results. This study explored whether the quality or quantity perspective better explains the difference in emotional labor strategy profiles on job emotions, job satisfaction, and job burnout. In sum, this study adopted a person-oriented analysis from the perspectives of quality (based on multidimensional emotional labor strategies, namely adaptive and maladaptive) and quantity (based on emotional labor strategy theory and conservation of resources theory) to explore teachers’ emotional labor strategy profiles and their relationship with organizational identification, role identification, job emotions, job satisfaction, and job burnout. The participants were 970 Taiwanese junior high school teachers (347 men and 623 women). An emotional labor strategy scale, teacher job identification scale, teacher job emotions scale, job satisfaction scale, and job burnout scale were adopted; cluster analyses, discriminant analyses, and analyses of variance were performed. The following results were obtained: (a) cluster analyses of teachers’ emotional labor strategy profiles revealed four profiles: a high-quantity group, a low-quantity group, a good-quality group, and a poor-quality group; (b) organizational identification and role identification predicted emotional labor strategy profiles; and (c) generally, the difference in emotional labor strategy profiles on job emotions, job satisfaction, and job burnout demonstrated that the good-quality group was the most adaptive, the poor-quality group was the most maladaptive, and the adaptation of the high- and low-quantity groups was between that of the good- and poor-quality groups. The results supported the perspective of quality; specifically, the emphasis of quality but not the quantity of emotional labor strategy profiles could better explain the difference in emotional labor strategy profiles on job emotions, job satisfaction, and job burnout. The study first adopted a person-oriented analysis from the perspectives of quality and quantity to explore teachers’ emotional labor strategy profiles and their relationship with related factors, which not only addressed the limits of past studies that adopted variable-centered analyses but also provided practical suggestions. For example, teachers should pay attention to the quality rather than quantity of such profiles by upgrading their adaptive emotional labor strategies and reducing maladaptive emotional labor strategies simultaneously to promote positive emotions and job satisfaction as well as reduce negative emotions and job burnout. Furthermore, educational authorities can guide teachers in using good-quality emotional labor strategy profiles to adapt to work by developing teacher training courses.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2896,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Repairing and Rebuilding Trust in Marriage,"Hsiu-Yun Tseng, Wen-Yi Shieh","trust rebuilding, trust repair, marital relationships, trust in intimate relationships","Being betrayed by a spouse having an affair is a traumatic experience. Some people choose to divorce, whereas some choose to stay in the marriage. For those who choose to stay, rebuilding trust becomes a critical challenge to overcome. When the trust in intimate relationships breaks down, relationships can be greatly damaged. Therefore, the ability to repair and rebuild trust is essential in couple relationships. This research aimed to explore the strategies that Han Chinese women in Taiwan use to repair and rebuild trust in their marriage after their husbands have affairs. The researchers were also interested in the existence of any cohort differences among the participants, especially after changes in the Volume of Kinship of the civil law that brings more gender equality in Taiwan like married women do not need to change her last name to her husband’s. Using purposive sampling and snowballing methods, eight female participants were recruited. Three were in their sixties and five were in their forties. They all experienced their husbands having an affair and chose to stay in their marriages. In addition, they underwent the challenge of rebuilding trust in their marriages. The researchers first used three scaling questions that asked participants to rate their trust in their spouse, trust in themselves, and trust in their relationship at three different timepoints (before the affair, after the affair, and at present). The researchers discussed changes in the scores with participants during the interviews. Semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted to understand how participants faced the crisis of losing trust, reexamined their marriage, and reevaluated their commitment to their spouse and marriage, as well as what actions they took.Friedman’s two-way analysis of variance by ranks was used to analyze the scores of the three scaling questions. The results revealed that the affairs seriously threatened the participants’ trust in their spouses and relationships. Regarding trust in themselves, no evident change occurred in scores before the affair, after the affair, and at present. During the interviews, the researchers attempted to further clarify four aspects: (1) reevaluating marital commitment; (2) taking specific actions to rebuild the marriage; (3) creating opportunities to repair and rebuild intimate trust; and (4) examining cohort differences in female subjectivity in a patriarchal society. Regarding the reevaluation of marital commitment, the researchers first examined how the participants evaluated the costs and benefits of staying in or leaving the marriage, and their decision to stay was further investigated. One major reason was the wife’s understanding of the affair and the husband’s regretful attitude and willingness to return to the marriage. Another major reason was the wife’s thoughts on marriage after the affair, such as (1) being unwilling to let go of her marriage and/or being unable to accept divorce; (2) returning to the original intention behind marrying her husband; (3) staying married for their children and family members; and (4) wishing for a good ending, which reflects the Chinese value of believing that harmony in a family brings success in all areas of life.Regarding specific actions to rebuild the marriage, the first was the husband’s changes after the affair, such as (1) being willing to admit his mistakes and promising not to hide things or keep secrets from the wife; (2) exhibiting a sincere apologetic attitude and compensational behaviors such as additional participation in housework, expressions of love toward the wife, and spending more time with the family; (3) stopping the affair; and (4) actively changing his behaviors to demonstrate commitment to the marriage, such as coming home on time and calling home when there is any change in his schedule. Regarding the wives’ changes after the affair, at the personal level they seemed to (1) choose to accept and express their own emotions; (2) exhibit more self-acceptance and self-acknowledgment; and (3) trust themselves again. At the relational level, they would (1) cease or avoid damaging attacks and blame toward their husband; (2) share their feelings more freely and treat their husband with kindness and tolerance; and (3) actively choose to trust their husband again. At the social level, they might (1) seek support from family and friends; (2) seek professional help; and (3) expand their social networks to distract themselves and gain resources. Regarding the creation of opportunities to repair and rebuild intimate trust, the couples (1) changed their original negative communication and interaction patterns; (2) expressed appreciation and thankfulness toward each other; (3) reframed what happened and found new meaning in the affair; and (4) chose to forgive and recommit to each other. Regarding cohort differences in female subjectivity in a patriarchal society, all participants expressed the importance of acknowledging and valuing their female subjectivity. They also emphasized the value of self-acceptance, self-acknowledgment, and self-empowerment. However, differences still existed between the older and younger generations. For the three participants from the older generation, their husbands had affairs that each lasted more than 10 years. Two participants actually signed divorce papers, but because their husbands did not agree they remained in the marriage. Both had careers and earned more than their husbands did, but because of the cultural value of being a faithful wife and mother and belief in not showing family scandal in public, they chose to save their family’s face and remain in the marriage. Not much power equality existed in these three marriages. However, because the women’s husbands were willing to return to the marriage and repair the relationships, the wives chose to exhibit acceptance, forgiveness, and tolerance toward their husbands, and they were able to rebuild trust in their marriage. The younger generation, because of their superior gender awareness, seemed to be more proactive in expressing their feelings and opinions. Among the five younger participants, three chose to get divorced after discovering the affair. Two of them later remarried the same man, and one was currently living with her ex-husband but had not registered to remarry. In regaining sexual intimacy after the affairs, the older participants seemed more passive and conservative; by contrast, the younger participants exhibited more interest in regaining sexual intimacy. Finally, the researchers proposed three suggestions for helping professionals: (1) when helping clients clarify the reasons for leaving or remaining in a marriage, professionals must help them not only consider personal costs and benefits but also examine the situation from the perspectives of family and culture; (2) regardless of whether a couple chooses to divorce or rebuild their marriage, professionals can help betrayed partners shift their focus from the betrayers to themselves. Rebuilding one’s self-trust and understanding one’s value and resources can help a betrayed individual to gain courage and power, which are helpful for communicating with a partner to rebuild trust in each other; (3) when helping couples rebuild their marriage after an affair, the present researchers believe that discussing sexual intimacy is beneficial in later stages. Taking cohort differences into consideration, helping couples talk about their needs, expectations, hesitation, and resistance in sexual intimacy can be helpful for rebuilding their marriages.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2890,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationships Amorg Marital Adjustment, Communication Patterns, Social Support, and Paternal Postpartum Depression","Shu-Han Yang, Yen-Chun Liu, Yen-Yu Chen","communication patterns, marital adjustment, paternal postpartum depression, social support","In the transition to fatherhood, fathers experience the same psychological stress as do mothers and require similar adaptation to their new social role. They are also at risk of postpartum depression; however, in Taiwan, new fathers’ stress and emotions have received less focus from researchers. The prevalence rate of paternal postpartum depression has varied from 8.4% to 10.4% among studies (Cameron et al., 2016; Paulson & Bazemore, 2010). Compared with the 5% prevalence rate of depression in the general population of male adults, the risk of depression in the first year after a man becomes a father is approximately double or higher (Cameron et al., 2016; Madsen & Juhl, 2007; Paulson & Bazemore, 2010). Paternal postpartum depression not only negatively affects the father but also the infant’s cognition, emotional and behavioral development, and future mental health and parenting behaviors (Epifanio et al., 2015; Melrose, 2010; Wilson & Durbin, 2010). Furthermore, paternal postpartum depression can have a negative impact on marital satisfaction as well as increase the risk of the partner suffering postpartum depression (Don & Mickelson, 2012; Paulson & Bazemore, 2010). From a systemic family perspective, the birth of a child is a major change in the family system. The subsystems of the couple, family of origin, family-in-law, and even friends are also impacted and must adjust to the birth of a child. Moreover, the marital relationship inevitably changes to accommodate the newborn family member. A father’s marital adaptation is significantly negative correlation with depression (Foli et al., 2013; Rollè et al., 2017) and anxiety (Rollè et al., 2017; Zerach & Magal, 2017). Furthermore, Norhayati et al. (2015) and Yim et al. (2015) found that marital relationships and postpartum depression are highly correlated. Beach et al. (1990) proposed the marital discord model of depression and suggested that disturbances in a marital relationship are the powerful predictor of future depression symptoms. According to this theory, marital adjustment problems are associated with partners’ handling of conflict in hostile and unsupportive manners, which fosters eventual increases in depressive symptoms. Heene, Buysse, &Van Oost (2005) found that negative communication patterns such as demand– withdraw and avoidance patterns were partial mediators in the link between depression and marital distress. Recent studies have also supported the notion that marital communication patterns may play a crucial mediating role between marital adjustment and depression; furthermore, such patterns are often targeted in interventions for depression in couple relationships (Harper & Sandberg, 2009; Heene et al., 2007; Jou, 2009). Although some studies have supported a negative association between paternal postpartum depression and social support (Gao et al., 2009; Wang & Chen, 2006), other studies have reported inconsistent results in that the effect of social support might be influenced by cultural factors. In Hong Kong, Leung et al. (2005) found that the more support a mother receives from her family-in-law, the higher her level of postpartum depression. This could be explained by the fact that most new mothers in Hong Kong live with their in-laws, and the more help they receive from family, the higher the frequency of potential conflict is. In Taiwan, families tend to provide substantial social support to couples during the postpartum period. Husbands may often encounter problems and conflicts between their parents and wives when couples have more contact with close family members (Lai et al., 2010). In this case, the social support perceived by the man may have a negative effect on his mental health. This study aimed to investigate (1) the prevalence of paternal postpartum depression in Taiwan; (2) the association between marital adjustment, communication patterns, postpartum social support, and paternal postpartum depression among Taiwanese fathers; (3) the mediating influence of three partner communication patterns (constructive communication, demand–withdraw communication, and mutual avoidance) on the relationship between marital adjustment and paternal postpartum depression; and (4) the differences between depressive fathers and nondepressive fathers in terms of marriage adjustment, partner communication patterns, and social support after their spouse gives birth to their first baby. This study recruited 258 Taiwanese fathers with their first baby in their current marriages. Their average age was 33.2 years (standard deviation [SD] = 4.17) and the average length of their marriage was 20.7 months. In terms of education level, 41.9% and 32.6% of participants had attended college and graduate school, respectively; moreover, 43.8% of participants share child-raising responsibilities with their wives and nannies; and 43.3% of participants and their wives were the main caregivers for their babies. The study was conducted in medical centers, obstetrics and gynecology clinics, and 37 mothering classes in Taiwan, and an online questionnaire was distributed on relevant parenting community platforms. Demographic and research data were collected using self-reported questionnaires. Each questionnaire contained the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (Spanier, 1976), Communication Patterns Questionnaire (Christensen & Sullaway, 1984), Postpartum Social Support Questionnaire (Hopkins & Campbell, 2008), and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS; Cox et al., 1987). The participants completed the questionnaire between 1 and 6 months after their babies were born, with an average of 11.7 weeks (SD = 2.8). When EPDS score ≥10 was used as the cutoff, 20.16% of the first-time fathers experienced paternal postpartum depression. Fathers with superior marriage adaptation had more constructive and less demand–withdraw and mutual avoidance communication with their spouses as well as lower levels of postpartum depression. The results supported the hypotheses that communication patterns partially mediate links between marital adjustment and paternal postpartum depression. Compared with nondepressive fathers, depressive fathers (EPDS ≥ 10) were significantly less satisfied with their marital relationships and had less constructive and more negative communication patterns with their spouses, such as demand–withdraw and mutual avoidance; however, these fathers perceived receiving more social support during the postpartum period, including that from parents, parents-in-law, and friends, but no significant difference existed between the two groups regarding social support from spouses. Although this result is different from most Western research findings, it is similar to those in the Hong Kong study of Leung et al. (2005), who found a significantly positive association between the level of social support provided by mothers’ family-in-law and their postpartum depression. Given the family-oriented culture of Taiwan, a newborn, especially the first child of a couple, usually receives much attention from both sides of the family. Social support related to childcare provided by grandparents as well as excessive advice and involvement in child-raising practices from family members, relatives, and friends could increase fathers’ stress levels. Therefore, the availability of social support does not necessarily have a protective or buffering effect on paternal postpartum depression (McVey & Tuohy, 2007). In sum, the prevalence of paternal postpartum depression in Taiwan discovered in this study warrants more clinical and research attention. Although negative marital adjustment and communication patterns were found to be risk factors associated with paternal postpartum depression, the impact of postpartum social support on Taiwanese fathers’ postpartum depression must be investigated further.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2889,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Application of Medical Family Therapy in Taiwan: Personal Actualization,Ping-Chuan Hsiung,"family-centered healthcare, medical family therapy in Taiwan, actualization","In Taiwan, numerous helping professionals provide family services in various formats and settings; although they are relatively familiar with the development of American family therapy in the 1950s, they might not know about the flourishing development of medical family therapy since the 1990s. Medical family therapy is a professional practice that applies the biopsychosocial–spiritual model and systemic family therapy principles in collaborative treatment for individuals and families with medical problems. This article has three sections illustrating the development and application of medical family therapy in Taiwan: “Trends of medical family therapy in Taiwan,” “The progress of medical family therapy in the United States,” and “The actualization of medical family therapy in Taiwan.” The aim of the article is to enhance helping professionals’ understanding of their profession’s developmental context of providing family therapy in healthcare systems. The author used the keywords “medical family therapy,” “medical counseling,” and “health counseling” to conduct a literature search from 1980 to 2019 in Taiwan and found 53 articles and theses. The majority of articles (88.5%) were published in the last 20 years, indicating that the field of medical family therapy has yet to fully develop in Taiwan. The section titled “The progress of medical family therapy in America” incorporates specific aspects such as controversy and support in medical family therapy, overcoming of barriers to high-quality healthcare, the formation and implementation of medical family therapy, the goals of such therapy, dynamic processes in such therapy, and the five levels of primary care and behavioral healthcare collaboration. The fundamental assumption of medical family therapy is that all health and relationship problems are biological, psychological, social, and spiritual in nature. Medical family therapy intends to address five ecosystemic splits that hinder health care: (a) splits between the mind and body; (b) splits between the individual and family; (c) splits among the individual, family, and institutional settings; d) splits among the clinical, financial, and operational worlds of health care; and e) the fault line between the often insular world of clinical health care and the larger community. Helping professionals must acquire interdisciplinary knowledge and clinical strategies to overcome the aforementioned splits and achieve the overarching goals of medical family therapy, namely the promotion of agency and communion. In this context, agency refers to empowering patients and families in making decisions regarding their health care, whereas communion refers to helping patients and families feel supported rather than isolated while coping with illness. By assessing individuals and their families’ needs and addressing their reliance, medical family therapists plan and implement five levels of systemic collaboration with individuals and their families: (a) minimal provision of medical information and advice, (b) provision of support, (c) undertaking of a systemic assessment, (d) undertaking of planned interventions, and (e) family therapy. This five-level systemic collaboration between biomedical-focused and psychosocial-focused professionals provides a holistic health care framework to develop services that fit the needs of individuals and their families in navigating health challenges. In the article, the author illustrates the essence of cultivating medical family therapy in current health care systems in Taiwan, with minimal reimbursements from the current National Health Insurance program to psychosocial–spiritual care and a lack of institutional structures providing family-centered healthcare. In addition to the institutional shortcomings, the general public is familiar only with advanced, high-technology medical treatments but not integrated, holistic, and family-oriented psychosocial–spiritual care. The author begins by describing her personal experiences in learning medical family therapy in the United States, where she completed an internship at the Family Medicine Center of Highland Hospital and the Department of Psychiatry at Strong Memorial Hospital at the University of Rochester, New York, from 1997 to 1998. Subsequently, the author spent a year at the Chicago Center for Family Health as a Fulbright Senior Scholar during 2018–2019, where her clinical sites included the Advocate Medical Group Family Health Center-Ravenswood and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago at Northwestern University. The process of actualizing medical family therapy in Taiwan includes developing curricula and professional training, moving from basic issues to contemporary issues, working with individuals with cancer, genetic disorders, and social withdrawal and their family members (cases examples), interprofessional competition and collaboration, and beginning from one invitation to sustaining collaboration with family therapists in Asian regions. The author designed and taught four courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Three courses were designed to provide students with basic and advanced understandings of the complex relationships among health, illness, and families: “Family, Health, and Illness,” “Family and Cancer,” and “Family Therapy and Health.” They offer students a family systems framework for working with the impact of health problems on patients and families and are especially focused on understanding that all health and relationship problems have biological, psychological, and social natures. Students are encouraged to examine their family-of-origin experiences relating to health and illness. The fourth course is “Self-Development for Helping Professionals,” which is designed to prepare helping professionals make active and purposeful use of their whole selves in their encounters with clients, with a focus on concepts of self-awareness, access of self, use of self, and self-care. Students are encouraged to develop insight into their personal life experiences, realize the implications of these experiences, and develop skills to intentionally use their own life experiences in facilitating therapeutic change. Students also examine their self-care strategies and attitudes. For more than 20 years, the author has provided clinical training in multiple settings to generate interest in medical family therapy and promote the application of the biopsychosocial–spiritual framework to work with problems related to basic difficulties (i.e., individuals with physical and mental disorders) and contemporary challenges (e.g., individuals with substance use and individuals with gaming disorders). The author facilitated the Chinese translation of The Shared Experience of Illness: Stories of Patients, Families, and their Therapists published in 2003 and the second edition of Medical Family Therapy and Integrated Care published in 2020. These two books are effective tools and foundations for local readers in understanding medical family therapy and its practice. Case examples describe working with individuals with cancer, genetic disorders, and social withdrawal and their family members. The following five strategies were applied to build a locally grounded and globally informed family-centered psychosocial oncology in Taiwan: (a) Forming multidisciplinary teams to enhance professional competence in conducting research and providing services; (b) applying a family-oriented systemic approach and working with healthcare professionals to strengthen biopsychosocial–spiritual holistic care; (c) collaborating with nonprofit organizations to establish evidence-based effectiveness research; (d) raising public awareness of the biomedical and psychosocial dual emphasis regarding comprehensive care; and (e) developing international collaboration in locally grounded and globally informed family-centered healthcare services. Collaboration is an essential aspect of medical family therapy as well as possible tension, and interprofessional competition might be inevitable. “Power and status in medical settings,” “role clarity and scope of practice,” and “teamwork and patient-centered practice” are areas that medical family therapists must address in themselves to prepare students and helping professionals proactively and constructively transform interprofessional competition into collaboration. Recently, more exchanges and collaboration have occurred among therapists in East Asia. The author spent a fruitful week (February 1–8, 2009) in Tokyo with an international expert team, including Dr. Khawla Abu-Baker of Israel, Dr. Young Ju Chun of Korea, Dr. David McGill of the United States, and Dr. Takeshi Tamura of Japan. The intensive exchanges included family-of-origin work and cross-cultural case consultations. The discussants kept in mind that awareness and continuous work on one’s self-of–the-therapist issues are crucial for the development of mature family therapists. The team members spent the first 2 days presenting and commenting on each other’s family genograms, during which insightful questions were asked and in-depth processing occurred. The examination and reexamination of family themes and interaction patterns led to further understanding of one’s family resources and challenges. Five cases were presented over the subsequent 2 days, where issues related to hikikomori were addressed in two families. Hikikomori literally means “social withdrawal” and has become a major social issue among young people in Japan. An estimated 3%–5% of the population between 18 and 25 years old suffers from hikikomori, and it affects more men than women. Those affected avoid and fear contact with people outside of the family. They do not attend school or hold jobs, and they stay home for months or years doing nothing; sometimes they are violent toward their parents or suicidal. Stimulating conversations surrounding the theme of the conference, “Culture, Gender, and Generation,” generated interesting viewpoints regarding intracultural as well as intercultural issues. Valuable exchanges continue in the Asian Academy of Family Therapy (AAFT) in the form of annual conferences and case consultations, which enrich training, research, and practice in East Asia. In 2021, The author will be a keynote speaker at the 7th Annual Conference of the AAFT in Seoul, South Korea, where she will address attendees on a topic related to medical family therapy. The author hopes that healthcare systems in Taiwan can achieve the dual aims of pursing advanced biomedical treatments and providing comprehensive family-centered healthcare. The ultimate goal of this article is to invite more helping professionals to provide services in healthcare systems and develop well-rounded social welfare and healthcare policies, thus bridging healthcare systems, patients, and their families.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2888,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Infuence of Early Home Literacy Activities and Home Resources for Learning on Fourth Grade Students’ Reading Performance,Chiahui Chiu,"early home literacy activity, home resources for learning, reading performance","Parents play a critical role in the literacy development of their children (Baker, 2003; Kush et al., 2005; Lee & Barro, 1998; Sonnenschein et al., 1996; Weinberger, 1996). Providing early home literacy activities or home resources for learning will improve children’s development of literacy skills. Parental involvement is frequently mentioned as a parental factor related to children’s reading (e.g., Arnold et al., 2008; Baker et al., 1995; Begum, 2007; Considine & Zappala, 2002; Lee & Barro, 1998; Rowe, 1991). Parental involvement refers to the amount of contact parents have with their children, the quality of their interactions, and their participation in their children’s school and home activities (Izzo et al., 1999). Home literacy activities include taking one’s children to the library, playing games to teach children new things, reading to children, engaging in shared reading, and providing reading materials. Research has revealed that reading enrichment activities at home have significantly positive influences on students’ reading achievement (Begum, 2007; Lynch et al., 2006; Purcell- Gates, 1995; Roberts et al., 2005; Rowe, 1991). Greater parental involvement has been associated with stronger preliteracy skills, and literacy experiences during the child’s preschool years have been associated with subsequent reading achievement (Arnold, et al., 2008; Neuman & Dickinson, 2001). Moreover, the availability of reading materials in the home is likewise strongly related to achievement in mathematics and science as well as reading (Sénéchal et al., 1998). Students with numerous books at home exhibit higher achievement in mathematics and science. However, whether early home literacy activities or home resources for learning are more influential on children’s reading performance remains understudied. In 2001, Taiwan began conducting national reading programs, which implemented reading activities in schools and even benefited students in rural areas. The government and private organizations have also begun to promote reading activities (e.g., Bookstart which is to give free books to every child under the age of 5) in families because of their own children’s reading development. After more than 10 years, the effects of literacy activity promotion and the provision of learning resources for preschool children in Taiwanese families were examined. The goals of this study were to compare the influence of early home literacy activity with home resources for learning on children’s reading ability and to identify which factor was more crucial for their reading ability. Data from the Progress in International Reading and Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2006, PIRLS 2011, and PIRLS 2016 in Taiwan were used. The studies had 4589 participants in 2006, 4293 in 2011, and 4326 in 2016, and all participants were fourth-grade students and their parents in Taiwan. Children’s reading achievement, early home literacy activity, and home resources for learning were measured using the Reading Achievement Assessment, Student Questionnaire, and Learning to Read Survey from PIRLS 2006, 2011, and 2016. The PIRLS assesses four comprehension processes in reading. The passages in the PIRLS are accompanied by colorful illustrations to help engage students’ interest, and several informational articles have noncontinuous text features such as text boxes or diagrams. The PIRLS includes 10 passages ranging in length from approximately 800 to 1000 English words (approximately 500 to 900 Chinese characters). The PIRLS achievement booklets are designed to assess children’s ability to comprehend text through comprehension questions. Each child responded to the assessment and received reading achievement scores. The PIRLS Learning to Read Survey was adopted for this study. Students’ parents were asked to report on the availability of home resources related to reading achievement. The survey investigated child–parent literacy interactions, home literacy resources, parents’ reading habits and attitudes, and home-school connections. The items of early literacy experiences at home included reading books, telling stories, singing songs, playing with alphabet toys, talking about things the child has done, talking about things he or she has read, playing word games, writing letters or words, and reading signs and labels aloud. Students were scored according to their parents’ frequency of engaging in these activities with them. All items were rated on a three-point Likert-type scale in which answers ranged from 1 (never or almost never) to 3 (often). The Student Questionnaire was administered to determine students’ home resources for learning. Students were asked to report on the availability of home resources. Home resources for learning included the following: parental education level, number of books at home, number of children’s books at home, a computer, a study desk for the student’s use, an Internet connection, a room of their own, and access to new digital media. All items were answered with yes or no. The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement’s (IEA’s) International Database Analyzer (IDB Analyzer) was used to combine and analyze data from all IEA large-scale assessments. This software tool analyzes data from most major large-scale assessments, including those conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, and the PIRLS (IEA, 2016). Each student was provided a single test booklet containing only a portion of the PIRLS assessment. The results were aggregated across all booklets to provide results for the entire assessment, and plausible values were generated as estimates of student performance on the entire assessment. Students’ performance averages were computed as the average of the weighted means for each of the five plausible values. The variability among these estimates, or the imputation error, for each variable was combined with the sampling error for that variable, providing an appropriate standard error that incorporates both error components. IDB Analyzer can handle complex sample designs and uses a plausible value methodology to calculate correct standard errors in analyses with large-scale surveys. Descriptive statistics, including percentages and means, statistical significance tests, and linear regression with dummy coding, were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that among educational level, early home literacy activity, and home resources for learning, parents’ educational level was the strongest predictor of fourth-grade children’s reading achievement. After comparing the results of the PIRLS 2006, 2011 and 2016, we found a strong positive relationship between reading achievement and early home literacy activity. Moreover, students’ reading achievement was positively related to their home resources for learning. However, the results further indicated that not all early home literacy activities and home resources for learning were beneficial to students’ reading. Furthermore, more activities or resources for learning did not translate to enhanced student reading achievement. For example, parents spending time teaching their children to write letters or words and children having their own cell phone were not beneficial to their reading performance. Parents reading books with their children prior to them entering school was more predictive of children’s reading achievement later in primary school compared with any home resource for learning. In sum, the results seemed to indicate that early home literacy activity is more influential than home resources are for learning on children’s reading performance. Both the frequency of early literacy activities and amount of home resources for learning increased over the 12-year period. This indicated that families in Taiwan have become increasingly willing to provide resources for their children to learn, and parents of preschool children are willing to spend more time reading together. The results also indicated that reading activities in families promoted by the government and private organizations have had a positive impact on the reading and writing activities and provision of learning resources for preschool children in Taiwanese families.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2895,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Heterogeneous Parent-Adolescent Relationship and Efects on Their Interactions with Factor Mixture Analysis,"Ya-Yu Cheng, Yu-Chung Lawrence Wang","factor mixture model, parent–adolescent relationship, Taiwan Youth Project (TYP)","Adolescence is a developmental transition set in motion by a cascade of hormonal changes and accompanied by various physiological, psychological, and social changes, including changes in the parent–child relationship. Parent–child relationships are regarded as the most significant relationships in people’s lives due to the profound psychological and social bonds involved. Intimacy is the essence of the parent–child relationship. However, when adolescents start to strive for more autonomy from their parents, changes in family conflicts occur. According to the separation–individuation perspective and the autonomy–relatedness perspective, autonomy development is thought to entail changes in conflict and power in parent–adolescent relationships. The aim of this study was to analyze heterogeneity in scales of intimacy and conflict of parent–adolescent relationships and their influences on adolescents’ perception of their intimacy and conflict with their parents, and also on the amount of information disclosure and satisfaction with their relationship. Data were extracted from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP), a panel longitudinal research project managed by Academia Sinica, Taiwan. The TYP investigates young people’s life experiences and development. The first wave of data came from adolescents who were seventh graders. Data related to the current study were retrieved from the sixth wave of the project. A total of 1745 (857 girls and 888 boys) 12th-grade adolescents (i.e., those in the final year of senior high school in Taiwan) were recruited. The items in the adolescent survey measured the degree to which adolescents had felt closeness and conflict with their fathers and mothers separately in the past year. Intimacy refers to positive affection, consideration of parents’ opinions, concern for parents, and respect for parents. Example items include “Inquiring about his/her opinions about important things”; “Paying attention to his/her thoughts”; “Expressing concern about him/her”; and “Seeing him/her as a model”. Conflict refers to quarreling with parents or giving parents attitude. The scale included five items related to intimate relationships and three items related to conflict relationships. Responses were given on a four-point Likert scale (from 0 = hardly to 4 = almost always). Regarding information disclosure and satisfaction with parent–adolescent relationships, adolescents answered the following four questions during the sixth-wave assessment: (1) “Will your father/mother tell you their thoughts regarding decisions that concern you?” (from 0 = hardly to 4 = almost always); (2) “How much information about your private affairs do you like to share with your father/mother?” (0 = none at all to 3 = a lot); (3) “Do you feel happy when you are with your father/mother?” (from 0 = very unhappy to 3 = very happy); and (4) “How do you feel about the relationship between you and your father/ mother?” (from 0 = very unsatisfied to 3 = very satisfied). Adolescents were asked to rate their relationships with both parents separately. The factor mixture model (FMM), implemented in Mplus 8.3, was used to analyze the heterogeneity of intimacy and conflict scores, and the BCH method was used to test the mean score differences in information disclosure and satisfaction among heterogeneous parent–adolescent classes. The FMM used a hybrid of both categorical and continuous latent variables, which allowed the underlying structure to be simultaneously categorical and dimensional. The study assumed several heterogeneous intimacy and conflict subgroups in parent–adolescent relationships. The FMM approach was suitable for this research because it allowed for heterogeneity within groups through the use of continuous latent variables.The results were as follows: First, the parent–adolescent relationships could be divided into three classes, namely harmonious, ambivalent, and conflict. The harmonious class was the majority (mother: 53%; father: 64%); the ambivalent class was the second largest group (mother: 41%; father: 30%); and the conflict class accounted for the smallest group (mother: 5%; father: 6%). Third, the percentage of adolescents who had harmonious father–child relationships was higher than that who had harmonious mother–child relationships; the percentage of people who had an ambivalent mother–child relationship was higher than that of people with an ambivalent father–child relationship; and the proportions in the conflict class were almost identical between fathers and mothers. Finally, adolescents in the harmonious parent–child class were most likely to demonstrate information exchange behavior with their parents, and they exhibited the highest satisfaction with their relationships; by contrast, adolescents in the conflict class demonstrated the fewest communication behaviors and were the least satisfied with their relationships.According to the results, parent–adolescent relationships were classified into three types. One type, namely the detached class (low intimacy and low conflict), did not appear in the current study. This might be because most of the senior-high-schoolparticipants still lived with their parents, who are the main providers of financial resources, daily life needs, and emotional attachment; thus, adolescents cannot avoid parent–child interaction. Second, the harmonious class was the largest among thethree classes. From a cultural perspective, Chinese culture emphasizes family cohesion and filial piety; therefore, Chinese parent–child relationships are relatively close, which leads to more intimate bonding, closeness, and affection between parents and children. In addition, since Western culture was introduced to Taiwan, parent–child relationships have become more democratic and responsive; an increasing number of parents adopt authoritative parenting, which is characterized by high degrees of support, warmth, and autonomy. Third, in contrast to traditional Chinese families, in which fathers are perceived as serious and emotionally detached from their children, the present study revealed that the adolescents had harmonious father–child relationships. This implies that fathers today are more willing to engage in parental activities; thus, they havemore interactive opportunities to establish father–child relationships. Consistent with previous findings, adolescents had more ambivalent mother–child relationships compared with relationships with their fathers. Mothers spend more time with their children; in addition to daily care, the interaction between adolescents and mothers involves more personal and deeper psychological feelings. Simultaneously, mothers usually assume greater responsibility for discipline and supervision of schoolwork and other activities. Teenagers receive pressure from their mother’s love as well as discipline; hence, they have more ambivalent feelings toward their mothers. Regarding information disclosure and satisfaction with parent–adolescent relationships, the harmonious parent–child class exhibited the most information exchange behaviors and the highest satisfaction with their relationships. The results of this research are consistent with those of past research that have indicated that close parent–adolescent relationships elicit warmth, supportiveness, and positive communication. Intimate relationships were also found to be major contributors to satisfaction. By contrast, the conflict class exhibited the fewest communication behaviors and were unsatisfied with their relationships with their parents. This finding is in line with those of previous studies. Several studies have indicated that parent–adolescent conflict influences adolescents’ perceptions of parent–child relationship satisfaction. Conflict will reduce adolescents’ satisfaction with their parents as well as cause negative feelings toward them. In this situation, teenagers are likely to avoid communicating with their parents and refuse to exchange information. Overall, the present study investigated heterogeneity in scales of intimacy and conflict in parent–adolescent relationships aswell as their influences. The results specifically revealed three types of parent–child relationships: harmonious, ambivalent, and conflict. However, this research is still in the preliminary stage and must be verified in future studies. This study’s limitationsand suggestions for future studies are presented as follows: First, only adolescents’ data were adopted; hence, parent–child dyadic analysis can be adopted in future research. Second, the participants were all from Northern Taiwan; therefore, futurestudies could include more participants from Taiwan’s Central, Southern, and Eastern regions.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2887,52.3,2021,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Construction of RAISE-up Model for Mid-Life Female Educators,"Hsiu-Lan Shelley Tien, Hui-Chuang Chu, Hsiao-Feng Cheng","female career, middle-aged female educators, life design, career narrative, grounded analysis","The concept of “career plan” has become the idea of “life design” in recent years as the postmodern philosophy evolved. In the career counseling process, the idea of fit between personal traits and work environment has also been transferred to be construction and empowerment when we interview the clients. The purpose of the study was to establish a hypothesized Career- Life Design Narrative Model for senior educator trough grounded theory. Twelve senior educators from school or university were invited individually. We interviewed those senior educators and audiotaped the interview process.The interviewers were 5 licensed psychologists trained by the first author in order to make sure the interview structure and process are consistent through the whole interviewees. All of them are PhD students or newly graduated from the PhD program in counseling psychology. The interview guide included the following categories: (1) Warm up and story recollection in early childhood, middle school, high school, university and education career; (2) Career/life themes were entitled and reflected to/ by the participants through collaboration with the interviewer; (3) Meaning search through the elaboration of current concerned issues and life themes; (4) Extension the life theme and current concern to the future; (5) Action plan and rehearsal for future plan to expand life meaning. The interview guideline was semi-structured and the outlines included the following questions such as early stories, role model, television show preferred, magazine read, mottos in youth age, and important life events. We also asked the interviewees trying to entitle the life themes for important life experiences. Through the discussion of life themes, the senior educator reflected the meaning of life. New tasks for future life were then emerged. Some of the tasks might be related to their unfinished business. Through the narrative approach of interview, they worked together to deconstruct the false or irrational thoughts about past events. New experiences were them emerged through reconstruction process in the interview.In the process of data analysis, in order to have a detailed examination of the interview progress, all the narrative interview process was transcribed. We then applied grounded theory to analyze the transcriptions. The analysis included open coding, axial coding, and core coding. Several steps were adapted in data analysis. We first scrutinize the transcribed data, identify irrelevant or meaningful contextual materials, code the meaningful units. In the second step, we compared the meaningful units, group the similar units together and conceptualize the categories. In the third step, we compare and group the conceptual categories into domain. Finally, we develop core categories by combining similar conceptual categories. According to Frontman and Kunkel (1994), the first step is “open coding.” In the second step, similarity comparison, categorization, and definition for each of the conceptual categorization were processed. We denote this step as “axial coding.” After open coding and axial coding, we then worked together to discuss and agree on specific category themes which is the step of “selective coding.” At last, a five-stage counseling process emerged. The five stages are: (1) Relationship establishment; (2) Awareness of life them; (3) Interpretation and transference; (4) Strength focusing; and (5) Extension to the future. We called it “RAISE-up model” by using the first letter of the five stages.In the counseling process, we first build relationship with the client, facilitate his/her self-awareness, help them get insight from interpretation, encouraged them to be assertive about their strengths and them set action plan for future life. For each counseling stage, which is core category, there are counseling skills and tasks which emerged as axial coding. For example, in the first stage, “Relationship establishment”, we discuss the counseling structure, tell the client what we are going to do in the process. In this stage, we help the client examine his/her emotional status and get ready to share his/her life stories. In the second stage, which is to get the clients be “Aware of their career/life themes” through telling the stories. The interviewer help the clients explore their roles in the life stories, construct the story and life themes, and even help the clients get insights from the stories. In the third stage, which we called “Insight stage”, we help the clients elaborating the life themes, deconstructing faulty cognitions and reorganizing the memories into a positive and meaningful script. In this stage, the clients get new ideas from the old experiences. It’s also in this stage that the client can see themselves in a positive way. There comes the fourth stage, we called it Strength-focused stage. In this stage, both the client and interviewers can easily sense the client’s strengths through story experiences. The clients re-experience how they copy with barriers and get energy to overcome difficulties at certain point of life time. Some of them might encounter happenstance such as important persons who influence their career. Some of the chances are key events, for example participated in a conference or meeting and through the meeting they enter a new position in different cities. The connection with others could facilitate their interpersonal relationship and even provide them with more chances for their career. This is the special characteristic for this model. The final stage is Extension to the future, which focus on action plan based on the clients’ strengths. Future time perspective would be another variable important to remind the client think about their future.Generally speaking, the stage “strength-focused” is the special part of this model. During the research, in the interview process, we did not emphasize on strength purposefully. However, when the interviews progressed, we found that both client and interviewer can work on the strengths even though the stories were about suffering from difficulties and aches. The resilience is one example. They can stand in front of barriers, tolerate the bad temper from family members or colleagues. However, in addition to the tolerance, they can even create energy either through sharing the pain with close friends or devoted to what they think they should do, for example educate the kids at school and work as volunteer related to religion supporting group.The findings were discussed in the following four points: the RAISE-up model vs postmodern reflection; Chinese culture and its relationship with the RAISE-up model; the RAISE-up model and Savickas construction idea. The construction idea proposed by Savickas is actually consistent with the post-modern thought. For applied in career counseling, especially for life design, Savickas (2012) proposed three important components for the life design counseling process: (1) construct career through stories; (2) deconstruct those stories and reconstruct them into an identity narrative and life portrait; and (3) co- construct intentions that lead to the next episode in the real world. This process is consistent with the process of counseling in our RAISE-up model. The different part is that we focus more on the clients’ strengths. The process is also consistent with the helping skills model proposed by Hill (2009). Also, the different part is the strength focused. It seems that in the modern society, the counseling direction naturally goes to the individual’s strengths. We hope the RAISE-up model created in this study can be generalized to populations in other age-spectrum, not only for ages over 50 in Chinese society. More discussions were provided based on the results. Suggestions for practice and research were also provided.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2877,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A study of Taiwanese adolescents’ career purpose,"Yu-Chen Wang, Ching Tseng, Chin-Huai Chen, Ming-Yan Jian, Xsin-Yi Lin","career purpose, career development, career development process, adolescents","Career purpose is a feeling of fulfillment and satisfaction emerging from the process during when individuals implement and practice their ideas of future career that may bring meaning and social contributions based on one’s unique interests, personal characteristics, abilities, and other meaning (Damon, 2008). A sense of purpose benefits life satisfaction, sense of meaning, hope, and positive emotions of adolescents. Career purpose also fosters positive feelings and feedback that are important sources for the development of self-concept of adolescents. The topic of career purpose is significant to career exploration of the youth as well as to school counseling and guidance practice, yet related studies are insufficient in Taiwan. Hence, the present study examined the impact factors and development of career purpose in Taiwanese adolescents. The study aimed to explore the impact of adolescents’ career purpose, the development of their career purpose, and their change experience. The participants in the present study were from the 152 adolescent participants in Wang’s study (2018) on the career purpose experience of the youth. The interviews at two points in time were conducted respectively with the ones who had goals for the future with firm plans and began to take action to be the participants for the present study. Thirty-one participants attended the Time-1 interview, and they were 12 boys and 19 girls, comprising 13 seventh graders, 10 eighth graders, and 8 ninth graders. Two years later, 21 participants, 7 boys and 14 girls, attended the Time-2 interview. The other ten participants dropped out the study or were lost after they graduated from junior high school or for personal reasons. Four research questions were addressed in the study: (1) What were the feeling and experience of the adolescents with career purpose? (2) What was the impact factor of the career purpose development for adolescents? (3) What was the change experience of adolescents’ career purpose two years later? (4) What was the overall development of career purpose? Qualitative research was carried out through individual semi-structured interviews at two points in time to collect data and the authors designed interview guides for the two interviews based on the study purpose. The interview at Time 2 was held two years after the interview at Time 1. All Time-2 interviews were conducted in school counseling rooms. The participants of 9th graders were contacted via their schools for the intentions and arrangements to attend the interview. For those who had graduated from junior high school, they were contacted via e-mail and phones for further information regarding their updated status. Interviews with the participants of junior high school graduates were conducted in the counseling rooms in their new schools with their schools’ permission. The Time-1 and Time-2 interviews were held during the participants’ lunch break or school free time in two to three successive weeks; each interview session lasted between 70 to 90 minutes. The data collected from the interviews at two points in time were analyzed with the grounded theory method (Strauss & Corbin, 1998).The results of this study reported the following findings: (1) The influences of career purpose on these participants are that they perceive career purpose as a part of life, accompanied with satisfaction, happiness, a sense of achievement, exploration and action, and career goals developing and establishing. (2) The development of career purpose is inducted into establishment factors of career purpose and change factors of career purpose. The former includes external environment factors and self-inner factors. External environment factors refer to the people and growth experience that influence adolescents’ career purpose and they are the influences of family, school, and role models. Self-inner factors comprised five elements which are passions and interests that trigger inner motivation; feedback from senses of achievement and meaning that foster further career development; evaluations and confirmation of self and environment; displaying strengths which lead to more confidence and action; and career concerns and thoughts that promote the pursuit and establishment of career purpose. On the other hand, impact factors of career purpose development include reality and growth, accidents and chances, and objections or oppositions from family. (3) Based on the data of 21 participants collected at the Time-2 interview, change experience merged during career purpose developing of two year is inducted into stability and unchanged and re-exploration. A total of nine participants stated their career purpose did not change during these two years. They firmly showed great enthusiasm for their primary career purpose and took vigorous action to pursue their goals. The other 12 participants reported in the Time-2 interview that they dropped their primary goal temporarily. Another steps that they took for their career purpose pursuing could be divided into three types: some re-explored their careers because their pursuit of primary career purpose was hindered; some transformed their careers without core career purpose remaining; and some found more suitable career purpose and changed their goals. (4) The development of career purpose are in five stages—involvement and initiation, action and feedback, concern and evaluation, initial commitment, and firm commitment/multi-development. This study further proposes a dynamic process model of career purpose development. The study concludes that career purpose embedded with varied development stages and impact factors is significant for adolescents during their career development. Under the influences of family, school, individuals, reality and growth and chances, the development of career purpose is an ongoing and non-stop process. The dynamic process model of career purpose development illustrates the whole process individuals go through during their career purpose development. Initially, individuals’ interests are generated after the individuals experience and get involved with some event occasionally. The following is the stage of action and feedback consisting of three parts—opportunity activity, action, and positive feedback that are presented in a cycle. The next stage is about concern and evaluation of self and environment. Individuals further evaluate whether they will carry out their career purpose as future goals. After the two-year’s development, some participants still stuck to their career purpose steadily and continued to head to their goals which led to a firm commitment. These participants persisted in brushing up on their knowledge and skills, heading to their goals during the process of their career purpose development. Some participants changed their career purpose or career options after confronting disapproval and disagreement from other people. Some other participants experienced a circular process, and experienced all the steps forward, backward, and forward again during the whole career exploration. Throughout the whole dynamic process of career purpose development, individuals may be under the influences of external environmental factors, internal personal factors, and reality and accident factors.School counselors are suggested to adopt different counseling strategies to assist adolescents in exploring and determining future direction. Moreover, the transition of different stages of adolescents may vary from time to time, the development of career purpose and change experience worth further investigation. A suggestion for a further investigation is to examine senior high school students’ career development after they enter college via follow-up studies. Another suggestion is to explore the change experience of college graduates who just enter workplace to look into their career purpose development after graduating from school. Narrative research is an alternative method to probe how relevant events and topics merge from the process of the development of career purpose in adolescents and how these events and topics are generated and prospered into unique narrative experiences of career purpose development.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2878,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Intergenerational Career Transmission in a Taiwanese,"Tzu-Yin Yen, Ting-Chia Lien","intergenerational career transmission, integrative process systems, medical family","In Taiwan, medical doctors have enjoyed privileged socioeconomic status since the Japanese colonial period. Although the prestige of doctoral professions has been challenged by changes in the medical environment and the introduction of the National Health Insurance program, most elite students are still expected to pursue a career in medicine and commit to it. The annual lists of students admitted to medical schools are widely discussed in the media, and they have also become something that high school rankings are based on.These medical students are often found to share similar backgrounds. In addition, there are numerous parent–child or sibling combinations in the field of medicine and even medical families that have produced multiple generations of medical doctors. In such instances, human capital, including property and nonmonetary rewards, is transferred within the family. Although no obvious barriers exist, the path to becoming a medical doctor requires more than well-defined interests or values. Individuals must ace the college entrance test, attend a competitive medical school, acquire comprehensive and systematic knowledge and skills, and pass a series of licensing examinations. Throughout the long and stressful process, the role of intergenerational transfer and the selection of information should not be underestimated.Studies have indicated that within the multigenerational transmission process, individuals’ development as well as families’ interaction patterns must be identified. Moreover, in the East-Asian social context of Taiwan, in addition to the person’s personality characteristics, career decision making often reflects occupational prestige and parental expectations. Therefore, both psychological factors and sociocultural contexts must be considered to understand individuals’ career choices.This study applied the “Integrative process systems perspective” to investigate the influence of a Taiwanese three- generation medical family on its offspring’s career development in the family’s interaction. Employing narrative inquiry as the method, this study explored the experiences of members across time and space with integrated and dynamic characteristics. Serial interviews were conducted with the grandfather and father, who were doctors, and with the son, who was still a student currently majoring in medicine. They were asked to talk about the family’s interaction as well as career choice, including their impressive familial stories, their experiences of career exploration, tendencies toward a specific occupation in different stages of development, the timepoint of commitment, the reason and meaning of becoming a doctor, and the family’s interaction patterns before and after members become a doctor. The category-content method was then used to analyze the factors of family interaction affecting an individual’s career decision making and intergenerational transmission. With the participants’ emotions, meanings, needs, perceptions, and awareness of situations, this study attempted to disclose an individual’s identity under “who I was,” “who I am,” and “who I will be” and also to reveal familial and social cultures. The purpose was to present the process of intergenerational career transmission on the medical family and outline the complete construction.In this study, the researcher was responsible for interviews, data transcription, analysis, and interpretation. To avoid the subjective bias of the researcher and establish credibility, a co-analyzer was invited to examine the process and product of the inquiry, determining validity in terms of logicality and persuasiveness.The results of the study revealed that intergenerational career transmission in the medical family was a process of interplay between family subsystems, embedded in social culture, which strived for harmonies between the maintenance of consistency and introduction of change. Individual family members were also mutually influenced by each other. The transfer of cognition and feeling led to the son’s decision to follow in the footsteps of his grandfather and father. In other words, intergenerational career transmission had characteristics of systems, processing, and integration. It was a continually changing, adapting, and spreading process.1. A cultural trait of Taiwanese society is that a career in medicine is highly preferred. The career-selection process for the son was influenced by society, time, and the environment. Society attributes prominent significance to the profession of medical doctor, building the stage for an individual’s career-selection process. Identifying with the significance of social prominence, the family created an environment of self-discipline that valued academic achievement and strictly regulated the scope and time for an individual’s career exploration. The family gradually conformed to mainstream values and encouraged their children to strive for a career in medicine.2. Intergenerational career transmission included the influence between two interplaying models: a social model and a parental model. Moreover, parents and their offspring were mutually influenced by each other at the family level. Each factor cannot be separated, and all should be considered in the context.3. In the social model, the establishment of highly praised social prominence affected individuals’ identification with a career in medicine. Children’s career choice was influenced directly by accepting the viewpoint of social prominence or indirectly by the awareness of their parent’s values. In the parental model, parental identification with social prominence led to the formation of familial meanings. The parents continually implied the positive information of the doctoral profession and proceeded to develop the family’s “unique meaning” of altruism. This unique meaning encouraged the children to acquire competencies required in the field, accelerated the career-selection process, and brought forward the timepoint of commitment. Both “social prominence” in the social model and “unique meaning” in the parental model affected the transmission of values interactively.4. The Taiwanese medical family was a marital-and-maternal-oriented system based on boundaries, rules, and career achievements. The family reinforced the unity of husbands and wives. Both spouses in each generation cooperated in domestic life but stressed the maternal career. The husbands were the role models for the children but spent most of their time at work. On the other hand, the wives assumed more responsibility for caring for and parenting the children. Well-demarcated boundaries and precise rules between subsystems and individuals in the family system, accompanying the family’s emphasis on the children’s academic achievement, promoted their offspring’s pursuit of a career in medicine.Based on these findings, this study produced several discussions and provided suggestions for those working in counselingpractice or related research.Career choice is not a simple process of matching an individual with an occupation and was influenced by the systematic context, the individual himself or herself, and the relationship. Therefore, in addition to an individual’s independence and autonomy, local counseling practitioners should consider the impacts of social culture, internal and external familial resources, and the awareness of an individual’s experiences in each stage of development.This study mainly focused on the phenomenon of intergenerational career transmission in a medical family. Thus, career decision making regarding a career in medicine was emphasized in the interviews. Apart from this topic, wives in the system were found to have quit their own careers immediately and fully support their husbands’ careers after marriage. The family also used different parenting styles depending on the sex of the children. Moreover, a third-generation daughter did not choose a career in medicine. From the perspective of a family system, the following questions are raised: what is the career-selection process of these nonmedical profession members? Is there any difference between sons and daughters? In the process, how did mental functioning and accommodation work? Future research should investigate the sex difference, mental functioning and accommodation of nonmedical profession members, and career-selection process of children who have not pursued a career in medicine.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2879,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploration of the Supervisory Experiences of School,"Shu-Hua Lin, Hsiu-Lan Shelley Tien, Hung-Wen Lu","school counseling, supervisor, supervisory experience, supervisory system","The purpose of this study was to explore the supervisory experiences of school counseling supervisors and the perspectives of the construction of a school counseling supervisory system. This study aimed to understand the supervisory experiences of school counseling supervisors and how said experiences developed. The construction of a school counseling supervisory system involved the requirements of qualified supervisors, training courses for cultivating supervisors, and the present situation of supervision, which was organized by the Supervision Agency.Ten school counseling supervisors participated in the study. Their average age was 49 years. They all had Ph.D. degrees in guidance and counseling psychology. Eight supervisors had teacher certifications, and 10 supervisors had counseling psychologist licenses. They were interviewed using semistructured in-depth interviews. After analyzing the transcripts by using the principle of grounded theory, this study found that supervisory experiences were a dynamic system circulating process. A professional map comprising supervisory beliefs and school counseling competencies guided supervisory dimensions, and reflections were generated from the practice of supervisory dimensions. After this step, the reflections provided feedback for the professional map. Through reintegrating the professional map, the same process was cycled again. The supervisory experiences were unfolded in the context of the school field; for example, if the supervisor had the knowledge that the role of a school counselor was to collaborate, he/she would set the goal of enhancing the ability of collaboration. From the practice of the supervisory process, the supervisor might be aware that the comprehension of the school counseling specialty would affect the supervisory process. By rearranging personal knowledge on school counseling, supervisors prepared themselves to supervise school counselors.The supervisory experience consisted of the professional map, supervisory dimensions, and supervisory reflections. The definitions are as follows: (1) The professional map included supervisory beliefs and school counseling competencies. Supervisory beliefs reflected the sense of mission and identification with the school counseling specialty. School counseling competencies highlighted the importance of the ecological system perspective. (2) The supervisory dimensions involved supervision goals, supervision functions, the supervisory relationship, the supervisory process, and supervision methods. In addition to intervention, conceptualization, and personalization, supervision goals placed greater emphasis on strengthening the collaboration ability, advocacy, self-confidence, and efficacy. Supervision functions included evaluating, modeling, instructing, consulting, supporting, and backing. The backing function refers to the supervisor entering the school counselor’s school when required, rescheduling the role of professional personnel, and communicating resource integration. The supervisory relationship stressed involving, nurturing the learning process, and attending to individual differences. The supervisory process took the form of group supervision and could make good use of group dynamics. The strategies included experiential, cognitive, and micro strategies. (3) The supervisory reflections were divided into self-awareness and self-expectation. This reminded supervisors that it was necessary to review personal professional knowledge and positions, avoid judging the school counseling specialty according to the mainstream value of counseling psychology, and think about how to relate the supervisory process with the value and accountability of school counseling.Perspectives on the supervisory system’s construction included the following: (1) The requirements of qualified supervisors meant that the supervisor would meet essential criteria, accomplish advanced standards, and acquire school counseling competencies. The fundamental criteria were having a working experience of more than 3 years, school work experience, and supervision experience. The advanced standards were experiencing continuous direct service with clients, supervising continuously, absorbing new knowledge, and maintaining self-awareness. The school counseling competencies comprised child and adolescent development, counseling, ecological collaboration, supervision, group work, school counseling, ethics, and law.(2) Training courses for cultivating supervisors were required to balance theory and practicum in accordance with the principles of the multilevel structure and practicability. Moreover, the supervisor and supervisee could learn from each other, and training courses could be implemented by the specific unit or cross-unit. (3) The improvement of the supervisory system should enhance the evaluation of personnel quality, loosen group supervision limits, and promote diversified operations. Overall, it should strengthen the evaluation mechanism and offer the supervisee more learning opportunities.According to research results, a supervision horizon figure of school system thinking was formed. It illustrated that the core spirit was the fulfillment of professional subjectivity. Supervisors took ecological system perspectives to understand the client being affected by systems and the environment. The systems affecting the client were family and school, followed by the community. Supervisors also understood school counselors working in the systems. School counselors engaged in helping practice in the hierarchy of the school system and were affected by the working systems, which were workplace, professional resources, and educational administration. Supervisors also had to be aware of situated systems. Because the student counseling center organized the supervision arrangement, the first system around the supervisor was the student counseling center. Furthermore, because of the backing function, the supervisor might enter the school counselor’s school or use administrative resources to help him or her. As a result, the systems that supervisors were involved with also included the school counselor’s workplace and the outer network system. The client, supervisee, and supervisor all shared the same macrosystem, involving politics, law, culture, religion, customs, and economics. When the supervisor understood the aforementioned phenomenon, he or she could employ five types of systematic thinking to supervise the school counselor: (1) being familiar with resources, policies, and laws; (2) making relationships actively and building trust; (3) making use of perspective-taking to consider the overall situation; (4) putting down parochialism to head for mutualism; and (5) assessing and inventorying resources to start the change.Based on the results, this study suggested that the supervisor should organize personal school counseling beliefs and competencies. Simultaneously, the supervisor can develop professional identification. How the supervisor identifies with school counseling would convey and affect the school counselor’s identification. The research results revealed that the supervisor who had served as the school counselor exhibited the thinking feature of leading resource integration. They paid attention to the process of system collaboration as an insider in the system instead of engaging in the collaborative relationship passively. In Chinese culture, if we must collaborate with others efficiently, we should put down parochialism and put others first. Therefore, it would be better for the supervisor to hold the perspective of the ecological system.When the supervisor used the school counseling supervision model, the ecological uniqueness of the school might have been considered. The supervisor not only explored the client’s inner dynamic but also comprehended the client’s situation from a contextual view. In addition to forming comprehensive supervision goals, enhancing collaboration, advocacy, self-confidence, and efficacy abilities was taken into consideration in particular. It was crucial for the supervisor to fulfill functions fully, especially the backing function. The supervisors’ coordination with each other through collaboration and introducing higher- level administrative resources could help school counselors resolve challenges.Regarding the construction of the integrated school counseling supervision system, it can be divided into three parts. First, in the personnel part, competencies and requirements should be strengthened. Basically, fundamental criteria have existed until now, and the advanced standards might be considered when applying for continuous education and reinstating credentials.School counseling competencies are worthy of future research. Second, regarding training courses, the supervisor, supervisee, and training unit could work together to plan ideal training courses. The supervisor and supervisee could establish a strong learning relationship. Furthermore, the supervisor can understand the practical work experience of school counselors more. The professional association and student counseling center offered training courses. Finally, regarding the applied model, supervisors needed the right of evaluation. Participation in the supervision of school counselors was listed as accountability and evaluation. In addition to group supervision, multiple learning choices and more opportunities were delivered to supervisees.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2880,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Effects of Experiences of Sexual Assault, Rape Myths, and Gender Biases on Sexual Assault Perpetrated by Homosexual Men in Taiwan","Jiun-Yih Huang, Te-Yang Hsu","homosexual men, gender biases, rape myths, sexual assault, sexually assaulted","Discussions concerning homosexual men currently focus on topics such as public health (e.g., AIDS and its transmission and prevention), identification processes, oppression and stigma, and the high prevalence of sexual abuse (Li Fangying et al., 2014; Liu Pei-Ling et al., 2016; Chuang & Lacombe-Duncan, 2016; Hall, 2018; Smit et al., 2012; Wohl et al., 2013; Wolitski & Fenton, 2011). In the past, homosexuality was unacceptable in mainstream society, and same-sex relationships underwent discrimination (Elipe et al., 2018). Perhaps because of this social context and the fact that sexual assault signifies conquest and power (Brownmiller, 1975), which is inconsistent with the image of homosexual men, research on the perpetration of sexual assault by homosexuals is limited. Homosexual men’s perpetration of sexual assault is not the same as male sexual assault on men. The latter perpetrators are not necessarily homosexuals, whereas a few of the former perpetrators may be able to assault women. Some studies have explored male sexual assault on men (Abdullah-Khan, 2008), such as male-on-male sexual assault in prisons; however, research is yet to be conducted on sexual assault perpetrated by homosexual men.Hirschi (1969) indicated that committing crimes is part of human nature. Under this point of view, it is understandable that gay men commit sexual assault. Studies have failed to investigate this issue; however, we believed this issue is worthy of research attention. Because the majority of sexual assaults are currently still performed by men (Police Administration of the Ministry of the Interior, 2017), this study explored sexual assaults perpetrated by homosexual men.Scholars such as Marshall and Barbaree (1990), Hall and Hirschman (1991), Ward and Beech (2006), and Seto (2019) have presented the integrated theory of sexual assault, which means that regardless of the subject (male or female) or object (child, adult, male, or female), sexual assault is within the explanatory scope of their theory. In other words, irrespective of the sex offender’s sexual orientation, causes behind the offence can be explained by high-level constructs. Accordingly, this study proposed the following three risk factors that partly explain reasons for sexual assault by homosexual men: experiences of sexual abuse, acceptance of rape myths, and gender biases. Experiences of sexual abuse constitute the social learning factor (undergoing sexual assault and then following the example), whereas rape myths and gender biases are cognitive factors. All the three factors are emphasized by the integrated theory of sexual assault. These factors are more instructive and cognitive in nature and therefore more changeable (compared with factors that are biological in nature). Hence, we chose them as the subject of our investigation to facilitate subsequent suggestions on sexual assault prevention.We assumed the following: (a) The experiences of sexual abuse, degree of rape myth acceptance, and gender biases affect homosexual men’s perpetration of sexual assault. (b) The age at which sexual abuse was first encountered, degree of rape myth acceptance, and gender biases affect the frequency of sexual assault perpetration by homosexual men. (c) According to Ellis (1991) and Seto (2019), targets chosen by sexual assault offenders are determined by their sexual preferences. On the basis of sexual preferences, we hypothesized that men are mostly the target of homosexual men’s sexual assault. (d) If homosexual men’s targets are mostly men, we hypothesized that the influence of male rape myths on homosexual men’s sexual assault is stronger than that of female rape myths. This is because male rape myths comprise a set of prejudices, distorted thinking, or stereotypes against male rape.We followed the research design of Bohner et al. (2005). Two types of questionnaire were developed to collect data online. In Questionnaire B, we placed independent variables (experiences of sexual abuse, two types of rape myths, and gender biases) before dependent variables (sexual assault and frequency of occurrence). The opposite was true for Questionnaire A. Because questions arranged first can trigger participants’ thinking and enhance their cognitive accessibility (heightened temporary accessibility), the stimulation (priming) may affect their answers to the following questions. Therefore, we expected that the association between the independent and dependent variables in the Questionnaire B sample would be higher than that in the Questionnaire A sample, in turn indirectly evidencing the causal relationship between the variables. Additionally, the impact of the order of questions and whether the results were the same in both the samples were also examined. Because Questionnaire A first asked participants about their engagement in sexual assault and frequency, the sensitive nature of the topic might have led to defensiveness; therefore, we predicted that the recognition of rape myth acceptance and gender biases in Questionnaire A would be lower than that in Questionnaire B.We recruited participants who identified as homosexual men and had experiences of undergoing sexual abuse or sexually assaulting others. A total of 414 valid responses were obtained (194 from Questionnaire A and 220 from Questionnaire B). Participants’ background information was as follows: (a) The participants’ average age was 28.28 years, the standard deviation was 6.57 years, the youngest participant was aged 16 years, and the oldest participant was aged 45 years; (b) Educational level: a majority of the participants were at the college level (250, 60.4%), followed by the graduate school level (109, 26.3%); (c) Primary caregiver: parents (307, 74.2%) and grandparents (39, 9.4%); (d) Experience of committing sexual assault: yes (47.3%) and no (52.7%); and (e) Experience of being sexually assaulted: yes (89.4%) and no (10.6%).The t test and chi-square test were used to determine the impact of the three types of risk factors on homosexual men’s sexual assault. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the impact of the independent variables on the dependent variable, and the amount of variance was explained. Additionally, all the independent variables were placed in the model to examine the effect of the exclusion of overlapping. Pearson correlation analysis and structural equation modeling were used to verify the model on homosexual men’s engagement with sexual assault and its frequency.The results of the study suggested that experiences of sexual abuse, acceptance of rape myths, and gender biases all exert a significant impact and explanatory power on homosexual men’s perpetration of sexual assault. A comparison of the samples of Questionnaires A and B revealed that Questionnaire B had a higher explanatory power for sexual assault perpetrated by homosexual men compared with Questionnaire A (27.1%–36.2% vs. 22.6%–30.3%). This result suggests that regardless of the order of questionnaire items, this study’s hypotheses were supported. Additionally, the result suggested that the independent variables arranged in front of the dependent variables presented a more effective design for confirming our hypotheses compared with vice versa. The average scores of gender biases and rape myths in Questionnaire A were lower than those in Questionnaire B, indicating that sensitive topics presented earlier made participants more cautious or defensive while answering subsequent questions. Furthermore, experiences of sexual abuse, rape myth acceptance, and gender biases influenced not only sexual assault by homosexual men but also their persistence in perpetrating the same. This study confirmed that the majority of homosexual men’s sexual assault targets were men, and regarding myths, male rape myths had more influence on their sexual assaults than did female rape myths.The results of this study revealed that both gender biases and the degree of recognition of rape myths influence sexual assault behavior among homosexual men. Therefore, the sexual aggression behavior signifying the implications of gender bias and power display discussed in past theories can also be observed in homosexual men.The various prevention and publicity measures against sexual assault in our society today are relatively designed from the perspective of viewing women as victims, and myths involving male rape are ignored. However, the impact of male rape myths on sexual assaults by homosexual men is even greater than that exerted by female rape myths, highlighting that male rape myths must be urgently understood and publicized to be eliminated. This may reduce the stigma male victims undergo (McMullen, 1990; Scarce, 1997), which in turn will increase their willingness to report and receive treatment. The perpetrators will have the fear that the victim will come forward, which might help reduce the rate of sexual assault. From a deeper perspective, providing societal acceptance of homosexuality and eliminating myths of male rape will not only reduce the rate of sexual assault, which is extremely underestimated (Coxell et al., 2000), but also aid the addressal of homosexual men’s sexual assault issues.This study recruited homosexual men who had experiences of sexual abuse or sexual assault as participants. Thus, the condition of sexual assault and victimization was widespread. We suggest that future research should include large and representative samples of homosexual men with no restrictions on sexual assault or experiences of being sexually assaulted. This will not only help estimate the prevalence of sexual assault and being sexually assaulted among homosexual men in Taiwan but also further confirm the external validity of the research results.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2881,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Parents’ High Expectations of Children to Become Successful? The Parenting Belief Mediating Effect between Socioeconomic Status and Home Learning Environment,"Mei-Tzu Chen, Li-Tuan Chou","home learning environment, parenting belief, chinese cultural parenting","Family is the first environment in which individuals come into contact with the process of socialization; said process is a crucial part of children’s lives and considerably influences them thereafter. Different parenting beliefs lead to parents exhibiting different parenting values and hence offering different learning environments for their children; this in turn can influence their parenting behavior. This study discussed the confluence of traditional Chinese culture and Western thought as well as parenting beliefs held by Taiwanese parents with young children. The actual circumstances of the home learning environment were considered. This research had three purposes: to understand parenting beliefs and the home learning environment that parents provide; to understand the relationship among socioeconomic status, parenting beliefs, and the home learning environment; and to determine whether the mediating effect of the model fit of parenting beliefs on the home learning environment is affected by socioeconomic status.The literature review focused on parenting beliefs, the home learning environment, and factors related to the aforementioned concepts. First, meanings, contents, and Chinese parents’ parenting beliefs were discussed. Second, the meanings and contents were discussed. Third, factors influencing parenting beliefs and the home learning environment were analyzed, including the relationship between home socioeconomic status and parenting beliefs, the effect of home socioeconomic status on the home learning environment, and the relationship between parenting beliefs and the home learning environment.Samples were retrieved from a database established by Chien-Ju Chang (2019), and the database called Kids in Taiwan: National Longitudinal Study of Child Development and Care (KIT): KIT-M36 at 36 months old [Data file]. The sample comprised fathers or mothers of babies born between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2014, including a total of 2,099 research participants. The research instrument was the Kids in Taiwan: National Longitudinal Study of Child Development and Care (KIT) questionnaire, which was planned and prepared from August 2011 to March 2016 by the Center for Educational Research and Evaluation, National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) and the Department of Human Development and Family Studies, NTNU, both commissioned by the Ministry of Science and Technology. This study used SAS 9.4 to test the median of the questionnaire scale for variables and perform correlation analysis. Furthermore, the study used structural equation modeling in Mplus 8.0 to analyze whether the mediating effect of the model fit of parenting beliefs on the home learning environment is affected by socioeconomic status.The independent variable of this research was socioeconomic status. Based on the formula revised by Lin (2005) from Hollingshead’s Two-Factor Index of Social Position (1957), the scores of respondents’ socioeconomic status were calculated as follows: socioeconomic status education level job type . The mediator variable was parenting belief, which consists of three constructs: guan, teaching, and achievement expectations. The word ""guan"" means ""caring"" or even ""love"" as well as ""ruling"" in Asian countries. There were three questions for guan, two questions for teaching, and three questions for achievement expectations; on a 4-point scale, interviewees’ correspondence levels were collected, and the median value of the scale was found to be 2.5. The home learning environment consisted of five constructs: environmental diversity, learning materials, learning stimulus, parental responsivity, and conditional discipline. There were four questions for environmental diversity, five for learning materials, five for learning stimulus, three for parental responsivity, and three for conditional discipline. On a 4-point scale, interviewees’ correspondence levels were collected, and the median value of the scale was found to be 2.5.To determine the validity of the research instrument, through factor analyses, three constructs of parenting beliefs were independently attributed to one factor. The cumulative explanatory variation reached 68.55%, and five constructs in the home learning environment were independently attributed to one factor; the cumulative explanatory variation reached 62.00%. Regarding the reliability test, the internal consistency measured by Cronbach’s α was .72 for total parenting beliefs, and Cronbach’s α was between .64 and .66 for each construct; the Cronbach’s α coefficient was .89 for the internal consistency of the total home learning environment and between .65 and .83 for each construct. The factor analysis and Cronbach’s α revealed that the research instrument reached acceptable levels of validity and reliability.This research discussed the parenting beliefs of parents with young children, the home learning environment that parents provide, and the mediating effect of parenting beliefs on the relationship between socioeconomic status and the home learning environment under the confluence of traditional Chinese culture and Western thoughts. The main findings and conclusions are as follows:1. In Taiwan, parents with young children still hold strict parenting beliefsIn Taiwan, parents of younger generations still hold a high level of guan and a “teaching” attitude toward their children; however, compared with parents in the past, they are seemingly not as strict. The results revealed that changes in parenting beliefs seem to have occurred; however, the research participants were parents with children under 36 months of age, and their expectations regarding their children’s achievements may thus have not clearly manifested. Therefore, long-term studies are required to follow the trend.2. In Taiwan, parents with young children provide a good home learning environment for their children.Today, most parents with young children tend to provide a good home learning environment for their children; especially in the constructs of a home learning environment, a positive relationship exists between conditional parenting and the home learning environment. However, whether conditional parenting does good or harms the development of young children requires further exploration.3. The higher the socioeconomic status of parents, the less strict the discipline and lower the expectation of parents.In Taiwan, parents with higher socioeconomic status tend to be less strict with discipline and hold lower achievement expectations for their children compared with those on themselves; however, a relationship does not exist between parents’ socioeconomic status and teaching beliefs. In addition, parents of a higher socioeconomic status provide a superior home learning environment for their children. Whether the introduction of Western parenting beliefs has influenced Taiwanese parents’ parenting beliefs requires further discussion.4. Although teaching does not exert a mediating effect on the relationship between socioeconomic status and the home learning environment, parents of all socioeconomic statuses place emphasis on teaching.Observed from the construct formula of this research, no significant relationship existed between home socioeconomic status and teaching; however, from the average analysis of teaching, parents of all socioeconomic statuses emphasize teaching. Furthermore, parents’ focus on teaching contributes to the provision of a good home learning environment for children.5. Guan and achievement expectation exert mediating effects on the relationship between socioeconomic status and the home learning environment.This research indicated that socioeconomic status influenced the aspects of learning materials, parental responsivity, and conditional parenting in the home learning environment through guan and achievement expectation. Parents with higher socioeconomic status tend not to hold overly high expectations for their children and know to assist their children’s learning with an environment more conducive to learning. Parents with lower socioeconomic status tend to possess higher achievement expectations for their children; however, they may not know effective parenting methods and tend to rely on stricter discipline when parenting. Hence, parenting education may provide parents with lower socioeconomic status with appropriate parenting methods related to guan and achievement expectation and also help their young children’s development with a positive and abundant home learning environment.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2882,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Buffering Effects of Parent-Child Reading on Young Child Development in Families With Immigrant Mothers,"Meng-Ting Chen, Yi-Cheng Lin, Yen-Ping Chang, Chin-Lan Huang","social development, immigrants, emotional development, language development, cognitive development","As Taiwan’s birth rate plunges, the number of children with an immigrant family background in schools continues to rise. Simultaneously, evidence is accumulating for various obstacles encountered by these families and children, including measurable financial and educational disadvantages, as well as immeasurable challenges caused by language and cultural differences. The literature has shown that children of immigrant families largely fall behind their nonimmigrant-family peers in several domains of development.Inconsistent findings have been documented in recent years. Chen (2010) as well as Ho and colleagues (2011) have reported no significant difference in academic performance between nonimmigrant- and immigrant-family students. Focusing on children whose mothers were from South-East Asian countries, who generally are of lower socioeconomic status (SES) compared with their Taiwanese-native counterparts, Wu and Tsai (2014) also found no significant difference in school performance between nonimmigrant- and immigrant-family children. Finally, emerging research pointed to the possibility that immigrant-family children can even develop stronger creativity than their nonimmigrant-family counterparts (Chang et al., 2014).Observing the inconsistency, we proposed that the relationship between child development and family backgrounds— specifically, growing up in an immigrant or nonimmigrant family—may be contextually conditioned and therefore moderated and potentially relived. Acknowledging other possibilities in the literature (e.g., parental involvement; Lahaie, 2008), we focused on one novel, potential moderating factor in the immigration context: the familial tendency of parent–child shared reading.Parent–child shared reading is believed to facilitate young children’s language and cognitive development. Studies have indicated that 12–16-month-olds’ language ability is correlated with whether they received shared reading with parents when they were aged 8 months. Research conducted in different cultures has also supported that shared reading strengthens older children’s language development (Chow & McBride-Chang, 2003; Farrant & Zubrick, 2011) and long-term learning efficacy (Blewitt et al., 2009).Given the central role of language in social life, it is anticipated that the benefits of parent–child shared reading extend into the socioemotional domain of development. Supporting this idea, Baker (2013) found that preschoolers’ reading ability is associated with the degree to which their parents were involved in their reading and writing activities at the age of 24 months; the effect of such shared reading in the early days is generalized to children’s later mathematic ability as well as attentional and socioemotional regulation. Critically, the effects cannot be explained away by the possibility that parents’ socioeconomic resources contribute coincidentally to both their reading time with their children and their children’s development (Hutton et al., 2015). The effects even seem to be stronger among disadvantaged children—such as those of low SES (Shahaeian et al., 2018), which most immigrant families in Taiwan experience—compared with among advantaged ones.To help close gaps between immigrant- and nonimmigrant children in Taiwan, the present research compared the effects of parent–child shared reading on key domains of child development between the two groups. Based on the literature, we argued that shared reading may reduce disparities between children from immigrant and nonimmigrant families. Specifically, our hypotheses were as follows:Developmental gaps. Because of obstacles they face, children with an immigrant-family background exhibit lower development compared with their nonimmigrant-family counterparts. The lack of development was expected to appear in all four domains of cognitive, language, social, and emotional.Shared-reading effects. However, these developmental disparities would be narrowed as the amount of parent–child shared reading in families increases. We expected this buffering effect on the cognitive, language, social, and emotional domains.Parental involvement. Given the significance of parental involvement in the child-developmental literature, that parent– child shared reading can be a mere instantiation of parental involvement, as well as anonymous reviewers’ suggestions, we considered and controlled for the effects of general parental involvement in the current study to explore the unique contributions of shared reading to child development.We used the open dataset of “Kids in Taiwan: National Longitudinal Study of Child Development and Care” in the Survey Research Data Archive of Academic Sinica, Taiwan, to test the hypotheses. The sample was nationally representative, and 2164 participants surveyed were 36-month-old Taiwanese children (Chang, 2019); their adult caregivers answered the survey. Furthermore, we focused on 1959 participants whose fathers and mothers were both native Taiwanese as the nonimmigrant- family group of the present study, and the remaining 145 participants whose fathers were Taiwanese and mothers were of a foreign-country origin as the immigrant-family group. We excluded those whose fathers were immigrants because there were merely 28 of them.Behavioral Rating Inventory of Cognitive Development for 2–5 Year Olds (Wang et al., 2015). This Likert-type questionnaire, included in the source data and used to assess children’s cognitive development, consists of 18 items for children’s memory ability and six for their executive functioning.Inventory of Language Development for 0–6-Year-Old Children (Liu et al., 2018). This Likert-type questionnaire, included in the source data and used to assess children’s language development, consists of three items for language comprehension, nine for language expression, and six more for emergent literacy.Inventory of Social and Emotional Development for Children (Chang, 2019). The Likert-type questionnaire, which was developed in the Kids in Taiwan project and included in the source data, consists of 13 items for children’s social regulation and 15 for their emotion regulation. The two subscales were used to assess children’s social and emotional development, respectively.Parent–child shared reading index. We averaged across three Likert-type-scaled questions in the source dataset to assess shared reading: (1) Number of books at home that are suitable for the child to read (including books purchased, given, and borrowed)? (2) On average, how many times a week do you read a book to the child? and (3) On average, how much time do you spend reading a book to the child each time?Parental involvement index. Once for the mother and a second time for the father, we averaged across the frequencies (four-point Likert-type scale) of five activities that caregivers can do with the surveyed children in the source dataset to assess parental involvement: (1) taking care of the child’s basic needs such as food and clothing; (2) teaching the child routine rules; (3) helping the child with his/her learning activities; (4) caring about and responding positively to the child; and (5) playing with the child.Following coding schemes detailed in the main text of the paper, the results indicated that immigrant-family children had significantly older, lower-educated, and less-involved fathers; younger, lower-educated, and less involved mothers; and lived in lower-income households compared with their nonimmigrant-family counterparts. We thus controlled for these potential confounders in the later analysis of shared reading.In terms of development, we found that immigrant-family children had significantly weaker cognitive, language, social, and emotional abilities compared with their nonimmigrant-family counterparts. These findings replicated past research, supported our hypotheses, and justified the current investigation into the possible benefits of parent–child shared reading.We dummy coded children from immigrant families as 1 and those from nonimmigrant families as 0 to study the moderating effects of shared reading on this code of family status. In a regression wherein a domain of child development was predicted by the family-status code, mean-centered shared reading, the interaction of the two, and the aforementioned controls, the results (Figure 1) revealed that parent–child shared reading significantly buffers the detrimental effects of young children’s immigrant-family status (versus nonimmigrant) in the cognitive, language, social, and emotional development domains. Upon closer examination, simple-main-effect analysis further indicated that nonimmigrant-family children only surpassed their immigrant-family counterparts in all domains when shared reading in the families was low (i.e., at +1 SD). However, when shared reading was abundant (i.e., at + 1 SD compared with the whole sample, or at + 0.18 SD if compared with other immigrant-family children only, as the value is their “within-group” + 1 SD), we observed no relative obstacles for immigrant- family children, and their cognitive and emotional abilities were trending in the direction of exceeding those of nonimmigrant- family children.Using a nationally representative sample, we reported high-powered evidence that parent–child shared reading, such as reading bedtime stories together, reduces and sometimes neutralizes developmental disparities encountered by 3-year-old children from immigrant families compared with those from nonimmigrant families. This beneficial effect generalizes across the cognitive, language, social, and emotional domains. When shared reading is strong, there is even an indication that immigrant- family children may perform better than their nonimmigrant-family counterparts in cognitive and emotional domains. This suggestion, nonetheless, requires scrutiny in future research that considers the contextual limitations of our present work, such as that we only considered immigrant mothers but not fathers and that immigrant families are generally disadvantaged.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2883,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Investigating the Effects of Rater Equating Designs on Parameter Estimates in the Context of Preservice Principal Oral Performance,Ming-Chuan Hsieh,"Many-Facet Rasch model (MFRM), preservice principal oral performance, rater equating design, rater severity","A problem in performance assessments is the degree to which rater severity and leniency can affect the examinee’s scores. In particular, fairness concerns related to performance systems include the exchangeability of raters. A possible resolution for addressing rater severity is for each rater to score each examinee’s performance; thus, the difference in rater severity would affect each student at the same level. However, this is not always feasible in practice for fully crossed rating designs. In the context of performance assessments, equating procedures create links between raters when performing transformation with a fully crossed rating design is not feasible and could control for differences in rater severity.An effective equating procedure involves a strong statistical model and a systematic data collection approach. The Many– Facet Rasch model (MFRM) is a commonly used approach for adjusting rater differences. Although the use of the MFRM model has gained popularity as an equating approach for rater severity, several key considerations related to data collection designs and model data fit are also crucial. In particular, it is vital to ensure a sufficient level of connectivity in the rating design; that is, the raters can be linked to other assessment components, such as other raters, examinees, or tasks.Three types of data collection design are commonly used for equating. The first type is a complete network design, in which the data consist of complete designs with subjects of all assessment components. This is an ideal design for a rating system. The second type is an incomplete network design. Under an incomplete network design, examinees do not have scores on all assessment components, but a partial and systematic degree of connectivity exists for raters and tasks to produce a connected network of assessment components. The third type is a nonlinked network design, where no systematic linkage exists in the components of facets. Even if the unlinked scoring network has some potential problems, many important exams in Taiwan still use this rater design.The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of differences in data collection designs that could affect parameter estimation in the performance assessment. Using empirical data, this study explicitly related the central role of consideration to data collection designs for the interpretation of results when the MFRM is applied. The study had two main research objectives:(1) To examine the impact of different data collection designs on parameter estimates for examinees’ ability, raters’ severity, and the difficulty of scoring criteria. The indices included infit, outfit, separation index, reliability, and the chi-square test. (2) To evaluate the correlations of ability estimates between different designs and the magnitude of their impact on the ranking of the examinees’ performance level. Examinees for the top 10, middle 10, and last 10 examinees in the complete network design were selected to evaluate their ranking differences for other designs.This study used the MFRM and oral performance score data of preservice principals to explore the effects of the three data collection designs. A total of four raters and 85 preservice principals participated. The raters scored seven criteria for each preservice principal’s oral performance: content, structure, word usage, attitude, pronunciation, intonation, and time control. Each criterion was assigned a grade of 1–3, of which 1 represents the basic level, 2 represents a proficient level, and 3 represents an advanced level. The raters were trained before the actual rating was conducted. The specification of each grading level and the standards were explained; raters were also required to complete rating exercises before conducting the official rating. The anchored videos at various levels for the raters were discussed. Through these anchored videos, the raters could better understand the standards.Four equating designs were considered in this study. Design 1 was the complete network design; four raters rated all preservice principals in this design. Designs 2 and 3 were incomplete network designs. In these two designs, some rating scores overlapped to construct the connectivity of scoring components. In design 2, each student received scores from three raters, whereas in design 3, each student received scores from two raters. Design 4 was a nonlinked network design, in which each rater only reviewed his or her assigned class; there was no connection between raters’ scores. The MFRM, a statistics model of the Rasch family, was employed to perform the four equating designs. When estimating the examinee’s ability level, raters’ severity and scoring criteria were simultaneously considered in the model.This study had two main findings: (1) For the incomplete and nonlinked network designs, some minor problems were related to the model fit, but overall, the infit and outfit indices were close to 1, which indicated that the use of the MFRM was feasible for analyzing the data used in this study. However, the reliability and separation indices for the nonlinked network design were low, and some chi-square tests did not reach significance—results that were quite different from the complete network design. (2) The lower the linkage between assessment components, the more biased the estimated stability of parameters. The fully connected network design provided the strongest connectivity at all levels (subjects, raters, and criteria), and this design was also the most ideal scenario for the data collection design. However, this design costs much in terms of rating time and money; thus, it is difficult to implement such a design in a large-scale test. By contrast, incomplete network designs are more feasible in large-scale tests, namely for establishing overlaps of the evaluation of some subjects of raters. The correlation between the complete network design and nonlinked network design was only 0.69, but the correlation between the complete network design and incomplete network design rose to 0.79–0.94. Moreover, a clear gap existed in participants’ rankings between the ideal fully connected network design and nonlinked network design. For example, student #59 ranked 79th in the complete network design but 21st in the nonlinked network design, equaling a ranking difference gap of 58. The results revealed that even if the MFRM is used for correction, large errors will still exist in the estimation of ability values and the ranking results of examinees for a nonlinked network design.This study provided two suggestions: (1) Examination institutions should avoid using the nonlinked network rater design. Carefully constructed network assessment designs based on effective data collection designs have the chance of obtaining objective and fair measurements within systems with multiple facets. Regarding current large-scale tests, many do not use any statistical models for rater severity correction; furthermore, they use the nonlinked rater design. It is possible that examinees can experience bad luck and encounter a severe grader, resulting in them receiving a low score. Therefore, this study recommended that important examinations in the future should adopt a more complete rating plan. (2) This study used empirical data. A simulation study can be considered to further examine the impact of different designs of component connectivity on parameter estimates. In addition, different experimental designs are worth discussing; for example, if examinees are nested within tasks, would this nested relationship affect the parameter estimates of ability and rater severity levels? The impact of more complex data collection designs are worthy of future research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2884,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Analysis of Relationships Among Science Contestants’ Cooperation Attitude, Knowledge Sharing, and Continuous Sharing Intention","Jon-Chao Hon, Jian-Hong Ye, Ya-Jiuan Ho, I-Chien Lin","continuous intention, cooperative attitude, knowledge sharing, hands-on science","With science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education in full swing worldwide, several science competitions based on STEAM have sprung up. One is Maker-Highlight-STEM&A, a competition sponsored by the Department of Education of the Taipei City Government, which involves STEAM learning and creativity through hands-on skills. In Maker- Highlight-STEM&A project making, knowledge sharing is crucial for seeking approaches to solve problems. Participants must know how to collaborate with each other and have a positive collective attitude to knowledge sharing to achieve the team’s goals. In particular, in the competition, the project topic is given on the spot, which encourages participants to share their knowledge and discover new ideas while creating project functions and improving their project quality, thereby helping them win the competition. Extending Kahneman’s (2003) dual process system, which states that automatic and reflective responses exist in knowledge sharing, we divided reflective responses into rational and emotional responses based on the cognition- affection model. To analyze the role of the three types of knowledge sharing, this study explored cooperative attitude as their antecedent and continuous intention as their predictor. In the highly competitive environment of Maker-Highlight-STEM&A, knowledge sharing in teamwork is crucial to win the competition; however, few studies have examined the correlation among cooperative attitude, knowledge sharing, and continuous intention to share knowledge. Because self-identity can foster attitudes toward a behavior in relation to the intention to perform that behavior, the present study considered the self-identity of participants in three types of knowledge sharing to predict their continuous intention to share knowledge in the competition.Group interactions can affect people’s motivation to share their knowledge. Thus, this research built a research model extended from trait activation theory and social sharing motivation theory. With cooperative attitude as an independent variable, knowledge sharing as an intervening variable, and continuous sharing intention as a dependent variable, we proposed the following six research hypotheses:H1: Cooperative attitude is positively associated with autonomous response. H2: Cooperative attitude is positively associated with rational reflection.H3: Cooperative attitude is positively associated with emotional reflection.H4: Autonomous response is positively associated with continuous sharing intention.H5: Rational reflection is positively associated with continuous intention to share knowledge.H6: Emotional reflection is negatively associated with continuous sharing intention.The purposive sampling technique was used in this research wherein all participants in the 2018 Maker-Highlight-STEM&A were invited to fill out a questionnaire survey. A total of 219 questionnaires were collected, of which 50 invalid questionnaires (with incomplete data) were excluded, leaving 169 effective samples for an effective rate of 77.2% and including 102 male (60.4%) and 67 female (39.6%) respondents.By performing the first-order confirmatory factor analysis, questionnaire items with lower factor loadings were deleted. Then, the reliability and validity of the questionnaire constructs were tested to ensure they met the thresholds of statistical standards. Model fit and path analyses were performed to verify the research model.When performing the first-order confirmatory factor analysis to evaluate the internal validity of items in each construct, items with residual values over 0.5 should be removed from the original questionnaire (Hair et al., 2018). In the original questionnaire, there were 11 items for cooperative attitude; five each for autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection; and five for the continuous sharing intention construct. Of the remaining items, those for cooperative attitude were reduced from 11 to six; those for autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection were reduced from five to four each; and those for continuous sharing intention were reduced from five to four. Exemplary items included “If my teammates have trouble shooting, I will help him or her right away” for measuring the cooperative attitude construct, with CR = .89 and Cronbach’s α = .90; “If any idea comes to my mind, I speak out right away” for measuring the automatic response construct, with CR = .84 and Cronbach’s α = .83; “If any idea comes to my mind, I determine whether it is rational before speaking out” for measuring the rational reflection response construct, with CR = .89 and Cronbach’s α = .89; “If any idea comes to my mind, I think about whether it will be rejected before I speak out” for measuring emotional reflection, with CR = .86 and Cronbach’s α = .86; and “I would like to continuously share knowledge in this type of contest in the future” for measuring continuous sharing intention, with CR = .94 and Cronbach’s α = .94. The CR and Cronbach’s α values were above the threshold suggested by Hair et al. (2018), indicating that the composite reliability and internal consistency of the questionnaire were acceptable.In this research, having a cooperative attitude was the independent variable, the three different types of knowledge sharing were mediating variables, and continuous sharing intention was the dependent variable. Data were analyzed and tested using structural equation modeling with AMOS 20.0. The results of the data analysis revealed that cooperative attitude was positively associated with autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection. Moreover, autonomous response was negatively associated with continuous sharing intention; rational reflection was positively associated with continuous sharing intention; and emotional reflection was negatively associated with continuous sharing intention.Throughout the competition, there were numerous benefits for participants apart from the purpose of the competition itself, including teamwork and knowledge sharing. Despite the fact that it is important to know how to effectively improve students’ knowledge sharing through such events, it has seldom been mentioned in research related to science competitions; hence, we conducted an empirical study targeting the 2018 science competition. The research results revealed that all three knowledge sharing types, namely autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection, played a positive predictive role in cooperative attitude. Emotional response and automatic reaction played a negative antecedent role in continuous intention to share knowledge. In line with the Chinese saying “thinking three times before taking action,” we should focus on knowledge sharing from rational reflection and deactivate knowledge sharing from emotional reflection and automatic response to improve knowledge transmission effects for participants to experience a more meaningful STEAM process.Remarkably little research has been conducted on learners’ knowledge sharing behavior in school and even less on such behavior in competitions. This research revealed that a competition involving teamwork, the behavioral model of knowledge sharing, and the intention of continuous sharing can be expanded to understand cooperative learning in any other STEAM- related contests. In addition, this study proposed three different types of knowledge sharing (i.e., autonomous response, rational reflection, and emotional reflection) extended from Kahneman’s dual-process theory (intuitive feedback and reflective feedback) to review continuous sharing intention. These three knowledge sharing types could be a reference for future research teams to improve knowledge-sharing effects in other cooperative settings.Onsite team competitions promote cooperative opportunities for participants to develop their attitude to collaborative work and knowledge sharing in rational reflection. Cooperative attitude development is essential for meeting the requirement of new 108 curricula. In line with this, other types of science or STEAM contests can integrate onsite activities to ensure that participants must work collaboratively to win the contest. In particular, National Science Fair or Science Olympic contests can be implemented with trouble shooting onsite, in which effective knowledge sharing can be embedded along with project making.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2885,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effects of Phonological Recoding on Taiwanese Students’ Reading Processes: Evidence from Eye-Tracking Experiments,Ying-Hua Guan,"Chinese reading, eye-movement experiments, phonological recoding","Phonological recoding is a psychological process in which readers convert printed words into sounds (i.e., phonological codes) during silent reading. The role of phonological recoding in reading has long been debated in the field of psycholinguistics. Most relevant studies have mainly focused on examining the role of phonological recoding in word recognition. Three major theoretical approaches have been proposed for lexical access. First, the phonological mediation model assumes that the meaning of a word is accessed through its phonology; that is, the sequence of the word recognition process is orthography phonology semantics. Phonological recoding of a word occurs prior to the access of its meaning (Lukatela & Turvey, 1994; Rayner, Pollatsek, & Binder, 1998; Van Orden, Johnston, & Hale, 1988). Second, the direct access route model assumes that the meaning of a word can be directly accessed through the transition from orthography to semantics without the mediation of phonology (M. Coltheart & Coltheart, 1997; Taft & Van Graan, 1998). The model, however, does not deny the possibility of phonological activation. Rather, it assumes that phonological recoding occurs concurrently to or later than the access of the word’s meaning. Third, the dual route model suggests that two parallel running routes can achieve lexical access: one is the phonologically mediated route, and the other is the direct access route (M. Coltheart, 2000). The route that achieves lexical access depends on the route that runs the fastest (Barron, 1986; Paap, Noel, & Johansen, 1992). McCusker, Hillinger, and Bias (1981) indicated that the difficulty of material, subjects’ reading fluency, the frequency of occurrence of items, and task demands can determine the use of phonological recoding.Chinese is a logographic language and is also regarded as a phonologically opaque one. Nevertheless, studies investigating the time course of phonological activation in Chinese word recognition have yielded inconsistent results. Although some evidence has suggested that phonology can be activated very early in the word recognition process when Chinese readers read Chinese words or sentences (Guo, Peng, & Liu, 2005; Tan, Hoosain, & Peng, 1995; Zhang & Perfetti, 1993), it remains controversial whether phonological recoding plays a crucial role in word recognition and text comprehension. Few studies have measured Chinese subjects’ reading comprehension under the condition of articulatory suppression, which has been proven to interfere with phonological recoding (Lu & Zhang, 2007; Ding & Wang, 2006). However, the results of such studies have been inconsistent, and whether phonological recoding is important for Chinese text comprehension remains unclear.This study conducted two eye-tracking experiments by using the same experimental paradigm implemented by Guan (2015, 2020) to investigate whether adult Chinese readers need to rely on phonological recoding to understand short expository texts and also whether readers without the background knowledge relevant to domain-specific texts must rely more on phonological recoding to comprehend them. In Experiment 1, 30 university students in Taipei were recruited whose mother tongue was Mandarin Chinese. They were asked to read 20 short expository texts (each one was 350 characters in length) under five different reading conditions: articulatory suppression, reading aloud, concurrent reading and listening to an irrelevant text (IRS), reading while listening to the same text (RWL), and silent reading. The topics of the texts included, for example, “advice for new graduates when entering workforce,” “the impact of 3C products on human cognition,” “water pollution,” “the color of eggs,” “the crisis of water resources,” “the function of sun light,” “the philosopher and the frog,” “Mr. thought,” “experiment with monkeys,” “the stereotypes of teachers in Taiwan,” and “the influences of watching TV on small children.” Subjects’ reading time and comprehension score for each text as well as their eye movements were recorded, which were then analyzed by several linear or generalized linear mixed models to find the best fitting model for each dependent variable. The results revealed that articulatory suppression significantly impaired reading comprehension and caused a larger regression ratio in text reading as well as a higher rereading rate on target words, whereas the effects of the other reading conditions on comprehension did not differ from each other. These results suggest that phonological recoding is essential for Chinese expository text comprehension and word recognition. Reading aloud, compared with silent reading, significantly increased the overall reading time, mean fixation duration, and number of fixations in a text but substantially reduced the mean saccade length and regression ratio. In word-level processing, reading aloud led to a much longer first fixation duration, gaze duration, rereading time, and total reading time on target words selected in the texts. Through word-by-word reading, reading aloud seemed to facilitate integrated sentence meaning, but it failed to significantly enhance overall reading comprehension. Moreover, RWL caused higher rereading rates on target words than did silent reading, and it did not improve reading comprehension. In line with results found under the reading aloud condition, the null effects of reading aloud and RWL on reading comprehension could indicate that both reading conditions make the covert phonological recoding during silent reading overt and therefore imposed similar effects on reading comprehension to those exerted by the phonological recoding in silent reading.Experiment 2 was conducted to further examine whether subjects’ background knowledge regarding the text content would moderate their reliance on phonological recoding in understanding domain-specific texts, such that subjects without much background knowledge would rely more on phonological recoding in the processing of unfamiliar terms and text content. To this end, 15 excerpts from journal articles in Scientific American were used as experimental materials. The topics of these texts were all about physics, such as the Higgs boson, quantum computing, loop quantum gravity, antimatter, charge-coupled devices, and 3He superfluid. The same experimental paradigm as in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2, and a different sample of 30 university students in Taipei were recruited as participants. Half majored in humanities and social sciences and had no background knowledge in physics. The other half of the students majored in natural sciences, such as physics, atmospheric physics, and materials science; therefore, they had background knowledge in physics.Participants were asked to read the texts and answer four comprehension questions after reading each text. The results revealed that only background knowledge had a significant effect on reading comprehension, whereas reading conditions and their interaction with background knowledge did not exhibit any significant effects. Participants with relevant background knowledge performed significantly better than did their counterparts. However, background knowledge did not moderate participants’ dependency on phonological recoding in reading comprehension. It seems that phonological recoding did not play a crucial role in understanding short domain-specific texts. Analysis of participants’ eye movements indicated that reading aloud could slow their reading speed and reduce their regression ratio, but it did not enhance reading comprehension. RWL increased the rereading rate on target words in short expository texts, and it increased reading time and the mean fixation duration in domain specific texts. IRS did not affect comprehension performance; it only increased the rereading rate on domain-specific target words and prolonged the first fixation duration for participants without relevant background knowledge.In sum, the results of this study suggest that phonological recoding provides critical support for Chinese adult readers to comprehend short expository texts, but it only plays a minor role in understanding domain-specific texts. When participants read domain-specific texts, it was their background knowledge that dominated their reading comprehension performance.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2886,52.2,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development of Promiscuous and Impersonal Sex and its Consequences on Sexual Assault,"Jiun-Yih Huang, Yaw-Sheng Lin, Ka-Fong Lei","early sexual experiences, promiscuous and impersonal sex, sensation seeking, sexual assault","The prevalence of male sexual assault on women is alarmingly high worldwide (Axinn et al., 2018; Carey et al., 2015; Kamdar et al., 2017; Koss et al., 1987; Walsh et al., 2014). Researchers have critically and widely discussed the social issue (Kuo et al., 2018) concerning the adverse effects of sexual assault on the psychological, physiological, and sexual well-being of victims (Dworkin et al., 2017; Rothman et al., 2019).Samples of convicted sex offenders and nonoffenders (Davis et al., 2018; Widman et al., 2013) have confirmed that promiscuous and impersonal sex is a major predictor of male sexual assault (Abbey et al., 2011; Casey et al., 2017; Malamuth, et al., 1995; Widman et al., 2013). Considering that sexual assault is a pertinent social issue, the causal factors of promiscuous and impersonal sex should be essentially explored. However, only a few studies have focused on promiscuous and impersonal sex in Taiwan. Particularly, studies focusing on the effect of promiscuous and impersonal sex on sexual assault have been inadequate. Male sexual assault on women constitutes more than 90% of all sexual assault cases in Taiwan (National Police Agency, Ministry of the Interior, 2017). This study bridges a critical research gap concerning male sexual assault in Taiwan and contributes to the international literature on this topic.This study particularly focuses on two aspects. Early sexual experiences pertain to one’s surroundings and life experiences (Dishion et al., 2012). Sensation seeking (a personality trait) pertains to biological factors from the perspective of trait theory and biological theory (Barenbaum & Winter, 2008; McCrae & Costa, 2008). These two aspects can help understand mechanisms underlying the development of promiscuous and impersonal sex.Accordingly, this study establishes a model to explain the development of promiscuous and impersonal sex and its effect on sexual assault. The following assumptions are made: (a) Early sexual experiences relate to sensation seeking, and both aspects predict promiscuous and impersonal sex. (b) Early sexual experiences, sensation seeking, and promiscuous and impersonal sex can predict sexual assault behavior and frequency. (c) Early sexual experiences and domestic violence relate to each other and can predict promiscuous and impersonal sex. However, the effect of domestic violence as a predictor of promiscuous and impersonal sex is often overlooked due to the high correspondence between early sexual experiences and promiscuous and impersonal sex. This study has verified the preceding assumptions.An anonymous self-report online questionnaire was used for data collection. The surveyed population comprised 998 men aged >20 years. The participants were aged between 20 and 55 years, with the average age and standard deviation being 23.01 and 4.38 years, respectively. Furthermore, 1.00%, 3.50%, 84.20%, and 11.30% of the participants had elementary school and junior high school, high school (vocational), university (college), and postgraduate education, respectively. With regard to caregivers, 87.10%, 2.30%, 6.10%, 3.30%, 0.40%, and 0.90% of the participants were raised by their parents, fathers, mothers, grandparents, relatives, and without family support, respectively. Participants were recruited through websites, and research questionnaires were administered through online platforms. Participants provided consent, and this study was approved by a research ethics review committee (REC number: 10503ES009).Variables were measured using self-developed tools or established scales with reliability and validity. The measurement tools were verified as having acceptable reliability and validity.This study used structural equation modeling to examine the effects of early sexual experiences, family violence, and sensation seeking on promiscuous and impersonal sex. In addition, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of early sexual experiences, sensation seeking, and promiscuous and impersonal sex on sexual assault. A structural equation model was used to examine the effects of early sexual experiences, sensation seeking, and promiscuous and impersonal sex on the sexual assault frequency. The results revealed that early sexual experiences were associated with sensation seeking. Furthermore, both the aspects predicted 16% of the variance of promiscuous and impersonal sex. Under the influence of early sexual experiences, the effect of family violence on promiscuous and impersonal sex became nonsignificant. In addition, the results indicated the following: (1) Early sexual experiences, sensation seeking, and promiscuous and impersonal sex significantly predicted sexual assault. (2) Early sexual experiences and promiscuous and impersonal sex had significant predictive effects on the sexual assault frequency. (3) Sensation seeking no longer had significant predictive power under the overlapping influence of the aforementioned variables.The study findings confirm the results of previous studies concerning the effect of early sexual experiences on sexual assault. The family environment plays a major role in sexual assault. This finding is consistent with Marshall and Barbaree’s (1990) assertion that sexual assault behaviors originate from abusive families. In addition, this study confirmed the effect of promiscuous and impersonal sex on sexual assault, consistent with the findings in the literature (Davis et al., 2018; Mann et al., 2010; Widman et al., 2013). Malamuth et al. (1995) asserted that early risk factors affect promiscuous and impersonal sex through the mediation of adolescent delinquency. However, this study demonstrated the direct relationship between early sexual experiences and promiscuous and impersonal sex. The study confirmed the effect of early sexual experiences, sensation seeking, and promiscuous and impersonal sex on the sexual assault frequency, which has been rarely discussed in previous studies. Additionally, this study clarified the role of early sexual experiences and family violence in promiscuous and impersonal sex.Early sexual experiences influence promiscuous and impersonal sex as well as predict the sexual assault behavior and frequency. As observed, early sexual experiences have more explanatory power than sensation seeking, thereby contributing to the development of sexual assault tendencies (Huang, 2000; Groth & Birnbaum, 1979; Seto & Lalumiere, 2010). Accordingly, early intervention in high-risk families (social workers, psychologists, probation officers, prosecutors, teachers, or researchers) and cooperation of professionals (Tien et al., 2017) can effectively prevent sexual assault behaviors.Factors such as adolescent delinquency, psychopathy, severe drinking, and false perception of women’s sexual intention (Abbey et al., 2011; Dishion et al., 2012; Malamuth et al., 1995) can be incorporated into the model of promiscuous and impersonal sex in future studies. This is because early sexual experiences and sensation seeking explain only 16% of the variance of promiscuous and impersonal sex. The confluence model proposed by Malamuth et al. (1995) indicates that early risk factors influence promiscuous and impersonal sex through adolescent delinquency. Subsequent studies can address this association and compare it with the results of this study (i.e., early sexual experiences directly predicts promiscuous and impersonal sex). In addition, sex offenders who are arrested and those who escape arrest demonstrate differences in terms of life adjustment, self-esteem, and causes of sexual assault (Smithyman, 1978). Accordingly, future research should focus on incarcerated sex offenders to explore and verify the hypotheses presented herein.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2873,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effects of a Mindfulness Curriculum on the Emotional Regulation and Interpersonal Relationships of Fifth-grade Children,"Yi-Hua Hsieh, Feng-Ying Huang","mindfulness, children’s mindfulness curriculum, emotional regulation, interpersonal relationships","The development of emotion regulation and interpersonal skills is an important task for schoolchildren, and learning and developing such tasks while of elementary school age is critical for individuals’ later life. The difficulty associated with emotion regulation in schoolchildren can exert huge, long-lasting impacts on children. The vast majority of mental illnesses are associated with difficulty regarding emotion regulation. The brain science research on emotion regulation has also found that emotional adjustment and the cognitive brain regions overlap each other in many brain areas and that emotional responses and cognitive function interact. Moreover, difficulty regarding emotion regulation is closely related to depression and also inhibits executive functions such as working memory and inhibition control, often leading to subsequent substance abuse. For example, previous studies have found that difficulties associated with emotion regulation in childhood are closed related to attention deficit, hyperactivity, and other types of psychological disorders. The research on mindfulness-based interventions for adults has shown that these can benefit emotion regulation, reduce pain and physical symptoms, reduce negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and rumination, and improve self-awareness and psychological flexibility. Mindfulness education for children is receiving increasing attention due to its potential to increase children’s attention, cognitive function and emotion regulation as well as promote proactive interpersonal relationships for this group. However, the purpose of mindfulness education for children is not simply to reduce their behavioral problems and physic-psychosocial symptoms, as its primary goal is to enhance children´s ability to relate to the self, both physically and psychosocially, and learn how to apply mindfulness activities and skills to their daily life. Therefore, children can foster their self-regulation ability, whatever situation they encounter. In order to fulfill this purpose, mindfulness education should follow the whole structural format of the mindfulness-based interventional programs (MBIPs) as well as brain-focused strategies to understand what sparks our instinctive, autonomic reflexes and how.However, implementing a children’s mindfulness education program in educational settings in Taiwan is still in the initial stage. To test the benefits of a children´s mindfulness education program containing brain-focused strategies on children´s emotion regulation and interpersonal relationship promotion, and the feasibility of its implementation in elementary schools in Taiwan, this study employs a mixed quantitative and qualitative research design. Additionally, considering the actual teaching situation, a total of 51 grade five elementary schoolchildren from two classes were recruited from a New Taipei City elementary school and were randomly assigned on a class-basis to a mindfulness education group and a waiting-list control group. The children in the experimental mindfulness group attended a 12-week ""Children´s mindfulness education program"", which entailed 40-minutes per week of mindfulness teaching. The content of the mindfulness education program met the requirements of the mindfulness-based intervention program format and MindUp curriculum architecture. At the same time, the children in the control group attended their usual classes. Both self-reported questionnaires and qualitative interview data were obtained before and after the intervention. The self-reported questionnaires, including the Youth Version of the Emotional Quotient Inventory, the Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Positive Emotion Scale, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. Qualitative interviews with both the participants in the mindfulness group and their school teachers were included to reveal the experience of learning mindfulness in context. A one-way ANCOVA was applied to analyze the quantitative data, and a semantic analysis was used to analyze the verbatim transcripts of the interviews. The quantitative result shows that statistically significant differences were found between the groups in terms of their total scores for the Emotional Quotient Inventory and the Emotion Regulation Scale. The scores of the interpersonal subscale in the Emotional Quotient Inventory and the emotional efficacy subscale scores on the Emotion Regulation Scale differed significantly between the two groups, although the scores for the Positive Emotion Scale did not. We assume that the reason why the score for the Positive Emotion Scale of the experimental group children did not change significantly may be related to the scale itself, since the questionnaire is based on positive psychology and cognitive theory, emphasizing the strategy of replacing negative emotions and thoughts with positive ones. The cognitive method of emotion regulation strategies emphasized the ability to re-appraise emotional and cognitive messages and change their content from negative to positive, but mindfulness emotion regulation strategies focus only on practiced acceptance and non-response to these emotions and cognitive content that are not based on the reality, which statement of the items of the Positive Emotion Scale may confuse the young students.What echoes our assumption is that the qualitative data demonstrated that the emotional adjustment-related benefits perceived by the students in the experimental group after receiving mindfulness education courses include the following main themes: increased emotional awareness, decreased frequency of strong emotional responses, improved automated responses, changes in emotional response strategies and behavior, and decreased emotional behavior, which are also consistent with their teachers’ reports. Moreover, the students in the experimental group also stated that they felt happier, calmer, cheerful, relaxed and other pleasant emotions after attending the mindfulness courses, as well as having a positive attitude toward knowing gratitude, self-confidence, a willingness to try, a willingness to share, and the courage to admit mistakes, which are consistent with the changes observed by the teachers, according to the teachers’ interview data. Nevertheless, there are some limitations to this study, including the failure to include an active control group as a comparison, so it is impossible to determine whether the overall effectiveness of the intervention was influenced by other factors, such as the leader of the mindfulness teacher and group dynamics. Moreover, being limited by the availability of valid mindfulness-based emotional measurements and scales in Taiwan for youth, this study cannot explain fully the mechanism whereby students manage their emotional impacts after receiving mindfulness education. Furthermore, although the study combines qualitative and quantitative research measurements, it is essentially self-reported data, so future research might include more objective measurement tools and methods, such as physiological biofeedback or neuropsychological testing.This study did not conduct a follow-up assessment, so it is impossible to speculate whether the children´s mindfulness education curriculum extends over time once the courses have finished.In sum, based on the quantitative and qualitative results, children who received mindfulness education are generally able to apply mindfulness skills to their learning situations and daily life and can enhance their self-awareness regarding their emotions through the facilitation of emotional expression objectively. The children’s increased ability to perceive and accept their emotions and express their emotions led to improved overall emotion regulation and emotional intelligence as well as more satisfying interpersonal relationships and interactions among this group. The current study echoes the previous studies on mindfulness education that demonstrate that a children’s mindfulness education program can effectively promote children´s emotion regulation and promote proactive interpersonal relationships. In addition to the interview data, it suggests that a children’s mindfulness education program is highly feasible within Taiwan’s current national education system, as it will constitute an important “emotion regulation and social-interpersonal promotion” course for elementary schoolchildren.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2868,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Conversations Between Parents and Their 5-Year-Old Children on Emotional Experience,Pei-Ling Wang,"gender difference, narrative style, narrative content, parent-child conversations","Conversations between parents and their children are a key pathway for the socialization of emotions in young children. Emotions displayed through parental conversations enable children to reconstruct the meaning of emotion and learn emotional values in cultural contexts. Gender influences parent–child interactions behaviorally and verbally. This study mainly aims to explore differences in parents’ use of emotional words and words in general, in addition to narrative styles and content, when conversing with their children regarding past emotional experiences. Accordingly, this study selected 30 boys and girls aged 5 years with medium-high language proficiencies with their parents; the average age of the children was 63 months (with an age range of 52–64 months). The researchers obtained parental consent to collect data on the young children’s language skills and conversations through four emotions of happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. The parents received three instructions from the researchers before parent–child conversations: (1) limit the four emotional experiences to those jointly shared by parents and child, (2) avoid story narratives, and (3) discuss events that occurred within the previous two months. The goal was to ensure fresh parent–child memories to prevent emotional experiences deviating from the emotional theme (Wang, 2001; Fivush & Wang, 2005, Wang & Fivush, 2005). The researchers recorded emotional conversations between the parents and children after confirming that the parents had understood the instructions. The parents randomly determined the order of emotional events. After data collection, researchers gifted the parents with a preschool education magazine, picture books, and an NT$300 gift certificate.After the data were converted into verbatim transcripts, the corpus was coded using the coding of Wang and Fivush based on three criteria. The first criterion was words and emotion words. Academia Sinica’s online word segmentation system was used to calculate the vocabulary size. Emotion words were calculated on the basis of (1) descriptive language that demonstrates understanding of the emotional state described, (2) emotional assessment of events, and (3) interjections that express emotions. The second criterion, narrative styles, included the following: (1) repetition, when parents repeat the child’s words without contributing any additional information but implying their understanding of the child’s emotions; (2) elaboration, when parents introduce a topic and revisit an event from a new perspective or provide new information based on a specific event, expressed through at least three consecutive parent–child conversations on emotional topics; and (3) clarification, when a parent and child have inconsistent understandings of an emotional event and engage in at least three elaborative conversations. The third criterion, narrative content, involved (1) emotional theme, when a child describes the origins of an emotional experience as personal feelings or interpersonal interactions, and (2) emotional regulation, when parents provide their child with concrete approaches for processing negative emotions. Furthermore, t tests, chi-squared tests, and two-way mixed analysis of variance were used to analyze the data.No difference was observed between the fathers and mothers in terms of the quantity of words and emotional words used. This result suggests that fathers play an essential role in the emotional development process during early childhood and that we have underestimated fathers’ daily influence on children’s emotional development. In this study, the fathers were more emotionally expressive and fully discussed emotions during an emotional conversation with their children. This contradicts the stereotypical image of an untalkative father. Furthermore, the mothers used more emotion words with boys than with girls in emotional experiences involving fear. This was probably because the mothers believed that boys should learn to perceive the emotion of fear and express their feelings through words instead of suppressing the emotion of fear.The results on narrative styles revealed that the mothers were more repetitive than the fathers when discussing emotional experiences involving happiness. Accordingly, the mothers effectively understood their children’s feelings of joy, and the children perceived that their mothers understood their feelings in their words. Compared with the mothers, the fathers more likely wanted to mold their children according to traditional gender roles and preserve the advantage of men in power and social status (Eagly, Wood, & Diekman, 2000); thus, the fathers more likely used elaborative styles to converse with their children in independent conversations. Denham et al. (2010) argued that fathers more likely respond to boys’ and girls’ emotions from the perspective of stereotypical gender roles. In this study, the fathers more often elaborated on boys’ fear, whereas the mothers elaborated more on boys’ sadness. This was because society expects boys to be brave and considers fear as inappropriate (Brody, 1999; Fischer & Mastead, 2000). Therefore, the fathers considered themselves as their son’s gender role models during independent conversations and believed that the boys must be fearless to take on great responsibilities when they grow up. By contrast, the mothers elaborated on their sons’ sadness possibly because they believed that boys might experience sadness when subjected to pressure in the future. Accordingly, elaborating on boys’ feelings of sadness during childhood enables them to observe, understand, and express the feelings in question at an early age.The results on the narrative content demonstrated that when emotional experiences involved either happiness (e.g., joy from going out, getting food, and eating) or fear (e.g., fear of being lost, the dark, nightmares, and sleeping alone), the children mostly described emotions caused by personal feelings. When the emotional themes were sadness or anger, the children more likely expressed emotions caused by interpersonal interactions, such as “being separated from family,” “being punished by the grownups,” and “being bullied by siblings or toys being taken away.” The parents provided more methods of emotional regulation in response to a child’s feelings of anger; however, most parents did not provide a means of processing negative emotions.The study findings suggest that parents and parenting educators should particularly focus on the unique influence of fathers on boys’ emotional development. They should affirm the special status of fathers in the socialization of emotions in young children and realize the pivotal role of fathers in the socialization of emotions in boys. Parents should provide concrete methods of emotional regulation during emotional conversations to teach children ways to regulate their negative emotions.Future studies should further analyze differences in parents’ meanings of words and emotion words to understand the implications of vocabulary sizes. Future studies should investigate the percentage at which specific vocabulary or language forms are used by parents as well as the extent to which parents elaborate on the four emotions and children’s possible responses. This study concludes that mothers and fathers play key roles in emotional development during early childhood. However, the limited nature of the sample, comprising parents predominantly belonging to the upper middle class, affected further inferences. Only a few Taiwanese studies have been conducted on the topic in question. Our initial findings may serve as a reference for researchers interested in the further investigation of parent–child emotional conversations. Subsequent studies are thereby prompted to create a more comprehensive image of Taiwanese parent–child emotional conversations.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2869,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of the Elderly’s Gratitude Deposition on Subjective Well-being: A Dual Mediating Mechanism of Emotion and Cognition,"Yi-Chao Chen, Chin-Lung Chien, Shih-Chi Hsu","aging, gratitude disposition, positive reminiscence, psychological resources, well-being","From the perspective of positive psychological resources, “gratitude” not only possesses plasticity, but is also an important psychological characteristic in elderly development. This study explored the connection between the “gratitude” of elders and their subjective wellbeing and probed into the mediating mechanism between them. Although aging is an inevitable part of life, elders are faced with many losses and restrictions that make elderly life difficult. Therefore, how to enable elders to “age positively” has become an issue of common concern for many scholars. In the past, multi-faceted successful aging indicators have often been adopted to reflect positive aging. However, this study used streamlined wellbeing of concern in psychology instead and employed basic conditions such as “reasonable physical health”, “low-risk disease or disability” as the control variables. This study that the emotional characteristic (gratitude disposition), a positive psychological resource elders possess, produces significant effects on the wellbeing of elders. Even behind the background variables of controlled population (age, gender) and living status (frequency of falling into illness, exercise status), gratitude disposition still plays an influential role on the three constituents of wellbeing. Additionally, gratitude disposition mediates the effects of gratitude disposition on the constituents of wellbeing through emotion (gratitude emotion) or cognition (positive life memory). In other words, psychological resources play a certain role on the wellbeing of elders. This study especially selected gratitude because it is a psychological resource with plasticity. At the same time, it is also in line with reachability in elderly development and is an emotional state often experienced by elders. These two characteristics enable psychologists to focus on changing the situation of elders in order for them to age more positively.Based on the research question and literature review, this study hypothesized that after controlling some life status variables that change with aging (frequency of falling into illness, exercise status), the gratitude disposition of elders still has significant positive effects on the three subjective well-being (SWB) components (including life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect). Besides, it was hypothesized that the effects of gratitude disposition on the three SWB components are mediated by the grateful emotion under the emotional aspect and the life reminiscence under the cognitive aspect.This study collected the information of 335 elders aged above 55 in Taiwan through the questionnaire survey method. The questionnaire contents include grateful disposition scale, positive/negative life reminiscence scale, life satisfaction scale, positive/negative emotion scale, grateful emotion scale, and control variables such as age, gender, frequency of falling into illness, exercise status et al. The above scales were mainly designed with the self-report measurement method. They were evaluated by the Likert 4 or 6-point scale and adjusted to suit the elderly. Please ask the elderly to circle the appropriate answer in accordance with their own condition. Initially, the descriptive statistics and correlations among the main variables were analyzed. Subsequently, the structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to examine the “dual mediating model of the elderly’s gratitude deposition on subjective well-being” to test the overall model fit and the path coefficients. The Sobel test was used to test the significance of the mediating effects, and the bootstrapping method was also used to compute the 95% confidence intervals for the mediating effects. In the model, with grateful deposition as the independent variable, grateful emotion and life reminiscence as the mediating variables, and life satisfaction, positive emotions, and negative emotions as the criterion variables, this study hypothesized that gratitude disposition can affect the three constituents of wellbeing (life satisfaction, positive emotion, negative emotion) through two completely different mediating variables, namely, emotion and cognition. The initial correlation analysis shows that the correlations among gratitude disposition, two mediating variables, and wellbeing generally support our predictions. Through the SEM analysis, the result shows that the proposed model has an adequate model fit, CFI = .94, RNI = .94, RMSEA = .06, SRMR = .04, χ2(113) = 256.281 (p < .001), and has no offending estimates. Under the condition of controlling the effects of age, gender, frequency of falling into illness, and exercise status, the results show: (1) gratitude disposition has a positive effect on gratitude emotion and positive life reminiscence; (2) gratitude emotion has a positive effect on positive emotion, but it also produces negative emotion; (3) positive life reminiscence has a positive effect on life satisfaction and positive emotion and it also reduces negative emotion; (4) gratitude emotion can mediate the effects of gratitude disposition on positive emotion and negative emotion; (5) positive life reminiscence can mediate the effects of gratitude disposition on life satisfaction, positive emotion, and negative emotion.In summary, gratitude disposition can affect the three constituents of subjective wellbeing through two different mediating mechanisms, namely, the life reminiscence under the cognitive aspect and gratitude emotion under the emotional aspect. In particular, life reminiscence produces greater positive effects. Compared to life memory, gratitude emotion not only produces weaker effects, but it also possibly brings about negative emotions. Therefore, compared to gratitude emotion, life reminiscence seems to be a more important mechanism contributing to the wellbeing of elders.In the face of the rapidly increasing elderly population, the government has vigorously set up local aging community-based care systems, such as elderly care stations. In addition, targeting elders requiring long-term care, long-term care institutions, lane/alley long-term care stations, and so on have been set up. At present, the service momentum of these systems is a totally inadequate measure, and the quality demands strengthening. While the long-term care systems are being set up by the government, it is also reflected that delaying elderly aging is perhaps the fundamental solution. Hence, a greater emphasis is given to front-end aging prevention. From a more positive perspective, aging prevention is about promoting positive aging. This study reveals that: Psychological resources “gratitude disposition” and “positive life reminiscence operations” concerning life integration that meet the reachability and plasticity of the aging development stage can promote positive aging and make elders happier, which are said to be in line with the government’s policy direction.In any of the above-mentioned elderly institutions, gratitude and positive life reminiscence intervention programs can be easily and conveniently implemented. Through frequent practice, the psychological resources in these two aspects can naturally be enhanced, making elders happier and age more positively. Although there are already some intervention programs that enable elders to age more positively, these intervention programs have not explored the internal mechanism. The results revealed in this study can be further applied in programs intended to enhance the wellbeing of elders. With a more refined and more appropriate intervention program design, it can be applied in various elderly institution activities and courses, enabling elders to more positively take purposeful actions on their own to make themselves happier and lessen the financial burden on the nation and society and the load on the children.Finally, this study incidentally found the part where gratitude disposition is inconsistent with previous research (such as gratitude disposition in the model directly and negative affect positive emotions). This study especially provided an explanation on this part. Furthermore, the research limitations, future research direction, and feasible programs were put forward, hoping that the solution formulated can serve as a stimulus for more psychologists to make substantive contributions to Taiwan’s aging society.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2874,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Teacher’s Interpersonal Experience of Receiving consultation from the Perspectives of Interpersonal Process Theory,"Ya-Ping Tseng, Su-Fen Tu","interpersonal process theory, teacher consultation, school counselor, school consultation, counseling psychologist","This study was part of a teacher–counselor collaborative consultation project (MOST103-2410–H33-029) hosted by Dr. Tu and sponsored by the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan. The project aimed to develop positive counseling strategies through collaborative consultation with teachers to solve teachers’ difficulties in managing students’ problematic behaviors in classrooms. Participants included six teachers and five school counselors. The six teachers included five women and one man aged between 26 and 51 years, with 1 to 21 years of teaching experience. The participants were required to take 10 weeks’ videotaping of their classes and participate in five sessions of face-to-face consultation. The corresponding author, who was a senior counseling psychologist with a 15-year experience of working with teenagers and their families, served as the consultant. In this study, a follow-up was conducted one month after the completion of the aforementioned project to collect the teachers’ consultation experiences. This study explored the teachers’ interpersonal experiences of participating in collaborative consultation with a counseling psychologist from the perspective of interpersonal process theory. A purposive sampling method was adopted such that all the teachers who completed the project were invited. All the teachers agreed to voluntarily participate in this study. A semi-structured interview was designed to collect in-depth data on the teachers’ interpersonal experiences of working with a consultant in a consultation room and their students in classroom settings. The participants were interviewed 1–3 times per person and 1.5 hours per time in average. With regard to data analysis, the researchers followed a four-step circulative procedure of phenomenological analysis developed by Lee & Lai (2009). The four steps were gaining the whole picture, breaking into parts, meaning transforming, and organizing.The results summarized two major themes: teacher–consultant interpersonal process and teacher–student interpersonal process. In the teacher–consultant interpersonal process, the teachers’ experiences were categorized into four subthemes: (1) A safe, positive, and supportive consulting environment eliminated resistance and enhanced cooperation. The teachers felt a sense of security and trust when they perceived the consultant to be understanding, nonjudgmental, and hospitable. Thus, the teachers were more willing to explore their issues in teaching and disciplining the students when they received support from the consultant. (2) Interpersonal feedback from the consultant enhanced teachers’ awareness and reflections on their interactive patterns and internal conflicts with the students; furthermore, conflict resolution, belief transformation, and new actions became possible. The consultant’s interpersonal feedback and empathetic understanding helped the teachers realize the effects of their interpersonal patterns on their interactions with students. Thereafter, the teachers could stride across their internal conflicts through continuous self-reflections. (3) The consultant helped teachers understand the context of student problems, deepened their empathies toward students, and initiated more positive interactive strategies with students. Through reinterpretation of students’ inner world by the consultant, the teachers comprehensively understood students’ problems, thereby changing their feelings toward students. Moreover, the teachers developed different perspectives toward students and new guiding strategies for the students’ problem behaviors. (4) The teachers could “learn by doing”—trying out their new teaching and guidance strategies through multiple sessions of consultation. Through learning by doing, the teachers’ improvements were verified by the consultant and their own actions, further consolidating their changes. The teachers applied new positive behavior support strategies jointly developed with the consultant to their classrooms and refined the strategies according to the outcome. Next, in the teacher–student interpersonal process, the teachers reported three interpersonal subthemes experienced with their students: (1) the teachers reported positive changes between students and themselves, thereby creating effective teacher–student relationships. The teachers could listen and understand students’ needs better, acquired students’ trust, and experienced more sincere relationships with students. (2) The teachers used positive languages to create a positive teacher–student interaction cycle in the classroom. The teachers duplicated the positive experience in the consultation process with the consultant to the teaching practice site with students. They used more positive and supportive languages and gave more positive appraisals to their students, thereby increasing positive responses from the students; therefore, teacher–student interaction qualities were enhanced, and positive interaction cycles were created. (3) Teachers provided new possibilities of working with students and new ways of fulfilling their educational philosophies. When the teachers found new guiding strategies for students’ old problems through consultation, they transferred the learning experience to other life situations; in this manner, they met their own educational philosophies. Consistent with the literature, the study results indicated that the strong relationship between the consultant and teachers encouraged the teachers to join the consultation. The consultant helped the teachers learn student psychology as well as the teacher–student interaction.Furthermore, the consultant expanded the teachers’ repertories of positive strategies in managing students’ problematic behaviors in classrooms. Moreover, the positive teacher–consultant relationship ensured positive teacher–student relationships in a classroom setting. Further, the author discussed the transformation experience of teachers from the perspective of interpersonal process theory. According to the theory, the teachers’ interpersonal experiences could be conceptualized into two stages: consultant–teacher interpersonal experience and teacher–student interpersonal experience.First, a trusted working alliance was formed between the consultant and teacher. For the teachers, seeking help and showing their weakness were stressful. The consultant was perceived to be understanding and nonjudgmental. Moreover, the consultant provided emotional support and interpersonal appraisal, resulting in new and differential experiences that helped the teachers relieve from their own frustrations. Second, the consultant helped the teachers identify their rigid interactive patterns and core conflicts under the patterns, thereby helping the teachers self-introspect and creating awareness of their role in managing students’ problematic behaviors in classrooms. Third, empowerment feedback from the consultant through multiple sessions of consultation and students’ feedback enabled the teachers to effectively transfer their learning to classroom situations and to develop newer and positive interpersonal interaction styles with their students. Accordingly, this study concludes that collaborative consultation with teachers facilitates teachers’ professional development and positive teacher–student interactions. Thus, counselors can improve the effectiveness of their work through collaborative consultation with teachers. In addition, pre-service trainings in consultation should be included in the school counseling profession.Finally, future studies should explore interpersonal processes and factors determining the transformation experiences of teachers from the perspectives of interpersonal processing theory.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2870,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effects of Solution-Focused Group Counseling on Break-up Adjustment of Unmarried Adult Females,"Hsiang-Yun Chen, Wei-Su Hsu","break-up adjustment, solution-focused brief therapy, solution-focused group counseling, group effects","Dealing with intimacy is one of the essential life tasks in early adulthood. Ending an intimate relationship results in a loss of social networks, emotional support, role positioning, future expectations, and self-identity associated with the relationship. Therefore, breakup distress may cause negative impacts on the establishment of new intimacy and the choice of future marriage.Group counseling combined with short-term treatment has gained increasing popularity. The solution-focused approach, which with the characteristics of a short-term treatment, considers clients’ goals as well as their strengths and competence and clarifies steps toward the clients’ future vision or desired solution. The solution-focused approach has unique insights in dealing with the grieving process: (1) loss is not a problem in itself, but the real problem is coping with a life that has experienced loss; (2) through the perception shift, the future still has space for negotiation after experiencing loss; (3) understanding people’s negative emotions that accompany the loss and respecting the uniqueness of their emotion in the social context of the person concerned are crucial; (4) when forming a solution, considering the normality and individuality of each person and valuing the individualized goals and healing process of the loss are essential; (5) a belief exists that the grieving and healing processes can coexist; accordingly, learning self-care is vital when encountering a loss; and (6) it is meaningful to focus on the importance of meaning reconstruction during the adjustment process.Numerous studies have confirmed the effects of solution-focused group counseling on multiple topics, such as substance abuse, behavior problem, and mental illness. However, studies on the effects of solution-focused group counseling on break-up adjustment in Taiwan have been inadequate. This study explored the effects of solution-focused group counseling on break-up adjustment for unmarried adult females.Participants’ selection criteria were as follows: (1) single, young, unmarried adult women aged between 22 and 33 years and (2) those who experienced a specific and profound breakup in the past year and felt that they had not yet worked through the breakup. After recruiting and individual interviewing, six unmarried adult females, including two who proposed to actively breakup, were invited to attend the solution-focused group counseling. Participants’ intimate relationships lasted from half a year to 10 years. The solution-focused group counseling was led by a female leader who was a qualified counselor with 10 years of training in the solution-focused approach. The group’s co-leader was another female counselor who had acquired basic training in the solution-focused approach.All the group members of this solution-focused group counseling accepted an individual semi-structured interview for one to two hours before the group counseling, at the end of the group counseling, and four weeks after the group counseling. These three interviews mainly focused on understanding the current situation of group members’ breakup experience and adjustment process, including their current thoughts, feelings, and corresponding behaviors of breakup; their current ability and confidence in the adjustment process; and their thoughts about this past relationship and their own future. Furthermore, the interview aimed to understand their experience and gains of participating in this group counseling. The interviewing data were analyzed according to the principles of thematic analysis in qualitative research. After an overall understanding of the interview text, sentence segmentation and coding were performed according to the minimum “meaning units” of each sentence of the interviewees. The units with similar meanings were then assembled to initially summarize and develop subtopics. Thereafter, the related subtopics were further compared and summarized into subthemes through repeated comparison and induction for classification and filing. Accordingly, the “theme” was gradually formed. Finally, data analysis was conducted across six interviewees. The research team continued to discuss during data analysis.The solution-focused group counseling comprised 8 sessions of 120 minutes each once a week. Each session began with a warm-up activity to elicit group members’ exceptional moments last week and recall small changes in their daily life. Each session included one or two main solution-focused activities and a 15-minute break after the main activities. The leader and co-leader discussed during the break and returned to the group for a set of compliments to all members. Before ending each session, group members were assigned homework. The group session had the following objectives: (1) positive opening and finding pre-session changes, (2) looking for coping strategies and exceptional moments, (3) reframing the meaning of breakup experience and concretizing the changes, (4) using a miracle question to picture the preferred future and goals, (5) amplifying strengths and setting the first steps, (6) amplifying useful coping strategies and prompting actions by relationship questions, (7) using scaling questions to concretize the progress and elements of changes, and (8) exploring positive experience and effective strategies for maintaining changes in the future. Although the main activities were pre-designed, this group still retained flexibility, enabling group members to spontaneously share important topics. Two group leaders applied specific techniques of the solution-focused approach when responding to group members’ reactions. The study results supported that solution-focused group counseling can enhance the group participants’ positive adjustments on breakup experience. The dimensions of changes subjectively perceived by these group members at different group stages included the following: (1) group members developed positive personal meanings and effective coping methods; (2) breakup experience became an opportunity to increase group members’ self-awareness and self-efficiency; (3) with regard to facing an original intimate relationship, group members’ situation changed from being confused to re-examining the relationship; (4) group members’ attitudes toward their future relationships became positive; and (5) group members began engaging in positive interpersonal interactions. Furthermore, group members’ experience of participating in solution-focused group counseling included the following: (1) the trust in the group provides a safe environment for members to re-examine and reflect on the breakup experience; (2) the strengths and advancement of each group member facilitated interpersonal learning, support, and positive encouragements; and (3) solution-focused group counseling activities empowered group members to take actions and improve their confidence and sense of hope.This study discussed the effect of group therapeutic factors of solution-focused group counseling on breakup adjustment. (1) Break-up adjustment in the solution-focused group counseling can be treated as a solution-building process, (2) future-oriented and goal-oriented characters of solution-focused group counseling can ensure a sense of stability among group members, (3) empowerment- and change-oriented characters of solution-focused group counseling can facilitate high positive incentives for group members, and (4) group interactions in solution-focused group counseling can create opportunities for mutual learning, help, and encouragement.Based on the research results, some suggestions were proposed for future research and counseling practice. Future studies can adopt the quantitative design, including a control group and the measuring scales of group counseling effect, to expand the effect of solution-focused group counseling. Future studies should explore the therapeutic factors and effects of group activities in solution-focused group counseling with different member backgrounds, including factors such as the duration of an intimate relationship, the length of breakup, gender, and age.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2875,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effectiveness of Solution-Focused Brief Counseling in Promoting Body Image of Adolescents,"Yu-Shan Su, Wei-Su Hsu","adolescent, body image, Solution-focused brief counseling","Body image is one of the crucial components of adolescents’ self-development and social interaction in a critical period of seeking self-identity. In the process of physical and mental development, the influence of negative body image cannot be underestimated. Numerous studies have explored the negative influence of adolescents’ body image; however, only a few studies have focused on positive body image and ways to improve it. Personal subjective perception affects adolescents’ body image. One of the essential research directions is identifying ways to assist adolescents in clarifying their subjective feelings and beliefs regarding their body image and promoting its positive development. Although solution-focused brief counseling (SFBC) is suitable in assisting adolescents, this approach has rarely been used in research on body image. Accordingly, the question posed is as follows: Can SFBC improve adolescents’ body image? Will the counseling effect of SFBC persist? This study aimed to (a) investigate the immediate and follow-up effect of SFBC on adolescents’ body image and (b) understand the effective factors of SFBC in enhancing adolescents’ body image. This study adopted the embedded mixed method research design, embedding the “quasi-experimental design of pretest, protest, and follow tests” into “ qualitative data on the interviews conducted immediately after the SFBC session and one month later.” The counselor was a junior high school counselor for 10 years and was trained and supervised under SFBC for almost six years. Purposive sampling was used to select adolescents with the following conditions: (1) Those who had a negative perception of their body image and used methods, such as weight loss and dieting, to improve their body image but still failed; (2) those who consciously felt bothered in interpersonal, emotional, or life adaptation due to their body image; and (3) those who were willing to participate in the research process and obtained the consent of their guardians. After screening, 10 adolescents aged 14 to 16 years were invited to participate in this study. After conducting research explanatory meeting, those clients with a high willingness to accept counseling every week and they were invited to be a part of the experimental group. Accordingly, five adolescents each were included in the experimental and control groups. Both groups had two males and three females. The experimental group received SFBC once a week for approximately 4 to 6 times according to their decisions. Since the SFBC sessions were conducted on a school campus, the structure of the interviews was changed to approximately 45 minutes for each session to match the schedule of this middle school. The three phases of the SFBC were revised to (1) “building relationship and developing a solution-talk” phase for approximately 30 minutes; (2) break phase for 5 minutes; and (3) positive feedback phase for approximately 10 minutes, providing positive feedback with compliments, bridge, and suggestions. The Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire (MBSRQ) was the key research instrument, a well-validated self-report inventory for assessing body image. The MBSRQ included eight subscales: appearance emphasis (9 questions), appearance evaluation (9 questions), weight emphasis (2 questions), weight evaluation (3 questions), physical fitness emphasis (6 questions), physical fitness evaluation (7 questions), health emphasis (3 questions), and health evaluation (4 questions). As attitudes, these dispositions included evaluative, cognitive, and behavioral components. The reliability analysis results indicated that the Cronbach’s α value of the eight subscales was between .7 and .82. This result suggested that the internal consistency of each subscale was good. The participants were required to complete the MBSRQ before the SFBC sessions, immediately after termination, and one month later. The Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was used to analyze quantitative data as well as the descriptive statistics. Meanwhile, the experimental group underwent one 30 to 60-minute semi-structured interview before the SFBC sessions, right after the termination of SFBC sessions, and one month later. The outline of the interviews referred to the eight subscales of the MBSRQ, including the following: (1) The understanding and evaluation of their current body image as a whole and its dimensions (such as their evaluation and emphasis on appearance, physical fitness, health, and weight); (2) after accepting SFBC, their perception for their changes in body image (such as their evaluation and emphasis on appearance, physical fitness, health, and weight) and others (such as interpersonal, family, emotional, self-confidence, or future expectations); and (3) their subjective perception of the benefits from SFBC and the effective factors during the counseling process. These qualitative data were analyzed according to open-coding principles, with continuous research team discussion. The study indicated a significant immediate counseling effect in enhancing the appearance evaluation and physical fitness emphasis of the MBSRQ in the experimental group. The average scores of the MBSRQ and other dimensions did not reach statistical significance among the pretest, protest, and follow-up tests. However, the scores were slightly higher at the end of the counseling session than those before the counseling and slightly decreased one month after the counseling but continued to be higher when compared with the scores before counseling. The experimental group in the interviews shared their perception regarding the benefits after receiving SFBC: being more affirmative with regard to their efforts on body image, having increased self-confidence and self-efficacy, learning the abilities of self-motivation and self-monitoring, willing to continue to change, placing more emphasis on health and physical fitness gradually, and producing a positive feeling of “accepting their own body image.” Meanwhile, these benefits reduced the emphasis on weight and appearance, and gave the client more sense of control. The effective factors of SFBC in enhancing body image perceived by adolescents included the following: (1) counselors’ encouragement; (2) successful past experiences, willingness, and goal formation; (3) discussions for specific steps toward personal goals; (4) self-encouragement, self-efficacy, and self-motivation ability; (5) combinations of old and new effective methods; (6) explorations of specific small changes and self-monitoring; (7) acceptance of body image ; and (8) future expectations and effective strategies. The effective factors described above would influence each other in SFBC counseling process. Meanwhile, the effective factors, such as counselor’s encouragements, self-motivation ability, goal formation and planning, and past successful experience emerged in the earlier stage of SFBC process; combinations of new and old effective strategies, discussion on specific steps, self-encouragement, self-efficacy, and self-monitoring, confirmation of small changes, acceptance of body image, and expectations and confidence for the future change emerged at a later stage of SFBC process. Particularly, willingness, motivation, and confidence of clients involved throughout the counseling process were core effective factors for these clients’ changes. These effective factors were related to principles mentioned in the literature on helping adolescents improve body image and clearly echoed the therapeutic concepts of SFBC. In short, the SFBC presented its counseling effect and reflected the influence of social and cultural factors (such as the media). Based on the results and discussion of this study, future studies should consider the following: use effective factors of SFBC to help adolescents in improving their body image; expand research sample numbers and their backgrounds; analyze the process of SFBC in detail and examine how its interventions create counseling effects; and explore more about the influence of media, gender, weight, or sports on adolescents’ body images when doing their counseling work.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2876,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Impacts of Attachment, Depression, and Active Coping on Adolescent School Life Disturbance",Ying-Fen Wang,"parental attachment, peer relationship, coping, depression, school adjustment","The transition from the 9th grade to the 10th grade0 in Taiwan could be one of the most stressful times for many Taiwanese adolescents. This involves leaving the junior high school that they were familiar with and entering a new school environment (i.e., a senior high school, a vocational school, or a junior college). Adolescents face various academic and social challenges in the new environment (e.g., learning new curriculums, getting to know new teachers, and establishing new friendship network). Findings of previous studies have revealed that school-related concerns have troubled many Taiwanese adolescents (Chen, 2006; Liu, 2004; Ou, 2012; Tung, 2018; Wang, 2007). The ability to adjust in the new school environment increases the chance of successfully entering the emerging adulthood. Furthermore, school maladjustment increases the risk of dropout, mental health problems, and/or misbehaviors (King, 2003; Henry et al., 2009; Maynard et al., 2015). Studies have revealed that parental and peer attachment (Al-Yagon et al., 2016; Laible et al., 2000; Lim & Lee, 2017), active coping (Lu, 2014; Merlo & Lakey, 2007), and the level of mental health in the past (Bond et al., 2007; Duchesne & Ratelle, 2014) significantly contribute to adolescent school adjustment. However, most previous studies have adopted a cross-sectional design and have overlooked variables when considering the effect of time on adjustment. This study adopted a longitudinal panel design approach. The author intended to examine the predicting effects of parental attachment and depression at 9th grade as well as the effects of peer attachment and active coping strategies at 10th grade on adolescents’ school adjustment. Specifically, this study aimed to (1) examine the relationship between parental attachment and peer attachment and (2) explore predicting factors for adolescent school adjustment during their transition from a junior high school to a senior high school, a vocational school, or a junior college. Of the sample of 229 adolescents, 161 (70.3%) were girls and 68 (29.7%) were boys. Except 11 participants who did not report their age, the mean age of the rest of the participants was 16.38 years (range = 15.75–17.75 years, SD = 0.33). Furthermore, 104 (45.4%) participants attended a senior high school, 82 (35.8%) were from a vocational school, and 42 (18.3%) were from a junior college, a comprehensive high school, or other types of schools. The Relationship Structure Questionnaire-Chinese (RSQ-C; Wang & Neville, 2006), Coping Strategies Scale-Chinese (CSS-C; Ji, 2002), Adolescents’ Behavioral Disturbance Scale-Chinese (ABDS-C; Lin, 2002), Adolescent Depression Scale (ADS; John Tung Foundation, n.d.), and a demographic questionnaire were administered. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of these scales were above .73. Participants completed the surveys twice. Participants’ levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance toward their mother and toward their father as well as levels of depression were assessed when they were in the 9th grade. Thereafter, participants’ levels of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance toward their best friend and levels of using active coping strategies were assessed one year later when they entered the 10th grade. These eight variables served as predictors, and participants’ levels of school life disturbance in the 10th grade served as the criterion variable. Furthermore, the Pearson product-moment correlation and the stepwise multiple regression analysis were performed to test the research hypotheses. The study findings indicated that adolescents’ levels of attachment anxiety toward mother and father (Time 1) significantly related to attachment anxiety toward the best friends (Time 2) (r = .39, .32, p < .01) and attachment avoidance toward the best friends (Time 2) (r = .15, .14, p < .05). Moreover, higher levels of attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety toward parents were associated with higher levels of depression (Time 1) (r = .33, .17, .35, .20, p < .01). In addition, depression (Time 1), attachment anxiety toward the best friend (Time 2), and use of active coping strategies (Time 2) significantly predicted adolescents’ school life disturbance (Time 2) (β = .21, .22, -.34, p < .001) (F = 29.86, p < .001). The cumulative explained variance of these three variables on adolescents’ school life disturbance was 29%. Surprisingly, two dimensions of attachment toward mother and father (Time 1) were not significant predictors of school life disturbance (Time 2). Furthermore, attachment avoidance toward both parents (Time 1) was not related to two dimensions of attachment toward the best friends (Time 2). Consistent with the literature, this study supports that prior mental health status significantly predicts adolescent school adjustment. It is hypothesized that adolescents with high levels of depressive mood in 9th grade may show deficits in executive function and attention. They may also become socially withdrawing. These cognitive and interpersonal difficulties hinder their abilities of handling academic challenges and seeking social support in the new school environment, thereby leading to school life disturbance. Additionally, the findings support the differential effects of two dimensions of peer attachment on adolescent school adjustment. Although attachment anxiety toward the best friend significantly predicts school life disturbance, attachment avoidance toward the best friend does not. Earlier studies have mostly examined the effects of peer attachment on adolescents’ negative emotion. Studies exploring the influences of peer attachment on adolescents’ school adjustment have been inadequate. Accordingly, this study added evidence to the current literature concerning impacts of peer attachment on adolescent school adjustment. This study did not find attachment avoidance toward the best friend to significantly predict school adjustment. This may be because Taiwanese adolescents’ interpersonal interactions with others are guided by cultural rules and based on types of interpersonal relationship. Therefore, although adolescents may request assistance from friends, when encountering real difficulties, they still seek help from parents and siblings instead of friends as kinship is stronger than friendship. The author assumed that restraining from requesting support from friends reduces the influence of attachment avoidance toward the best friend on adolescents’ school life disturbance. Finally, the most significant predictor is active coping strategy. This result echoes the findings of previous studies regarding the influence of coping on individual adjustment. When adolescents actively adopt a problem-focused coping strategy to address issues arising during the process of adjusting to the new school environment, their levels of school life disturbance are expected to be low. Unexpectedly, two dimensions of parental attachment in the 9th grade did not significantly predict adolescents’ school maladjustment in the 10th grade. As adolescents get older, peer attachment plays a more important role in individuals’ adjustment than parental attachment. Furthermore, peer attachment exerts higher levels of influences than parental attachment. The reason may be that parental attachment was measured in the 9th grade and was significantly related to depressive mood, attachment anxiety toward the best friends, and active coping. These three variables significantly predicted adolescent school life disturbance. In stepwise multiple regression, the variable was excluded from the final prediction model for not adding more explained variance to the criterion variable. Further studies are required to provide evidences on these postulations. The study findings highlight the influence of prior depressive mood, attachment anxiety toward the best friend, and active coping on adolescent school adjustment. Based on these findings, the researcher recommends intervention programs for teaching active coping strategy and for facilitating peer relationships for 10th graders.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2871,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Dispositional mindfulness has been linked to mental health outcomes such as stress, emotion, rumination, and executive function. More information on the effectiveness of current mindfulness-based interventions may have indicated improved mental health outcomes owing to attentional control, emotional regulation, and heightened self-awareness. Designs of previous clinical studies have demonstrated an amelioration of psychiatric symptoms through exposure to mindfulness training. Furthermore, they have indicated that the effects of mindfulness training are noticeable, such as changing the structure and functions of the brain.Evidence for the benefits of dispositional mindfulness or mindfulness training has been illustrated in relation to theneurophysiological mechanisms underlying the brain.Recently, imaging and neuroelectric studies targeting mindfulness conditions have been employed to investigate the potential neuroscience mechanisms associated with mindfulness. The accumulating evidence suggests that mindfulness is associated with brain activation and connectivity. The default mode network (DMN) is a relative new discovery among brain networks that provides a viewpoint useful for discussing operations of brain functions and networks. DMN helps us understand the individual processes of internal psychological states, cognition, the causes of mental diseases, and behavioral affected performance. The DMN is a set of brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and precorneal cortices. These regions are those typically deactivated regions during cognitively demanding tasks. Conversely, the increase of activity among these brain regions reflects the individual’s mental states as mind wandering and experiencing thoughts unrelated to the current task. The available evidence indicates the important role of DMN in daily life. This is because of DMN involving self-referential mental activity and manifesting experience with prior recalls, associated with psychiatric diseases and negative mental states.Specifically, few studies have explored the effects of mindfulness on the DMN. However, studies have yet to specify the characteristics of mindfulness training that benefit brain outcomes. This review investigates the manner in which neuroscience mechanisms of mindfulness are based on the perspectives of DMN to determine whether dispositional mindfulness or mindfulness training is consequential to the brain functions. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology appears to be most suitable for observing functional connectivity in the DMN. Furthermore, electroencephalography (EEG) explores functional connectivity in the DMN and can complement the limitations of temporal resolution in an fMRI. Consequently, we focused on cross-sectional, longitudinal, and interventional empirical studies using an fMRI and an EEG to further understand the relation between mindfulness and mental health and their influence on brain mechanisms. The literature reviews were carried out in the following way: The first section briefly describes the definition of mindfulness and DMN, then introduces the recent trends of researchers. The second section reports cross-sectional, longitudinal, and interventional empirical studies. Finally, the third section summarizes information regarding the relations between mindfulness and DMN, explores the potential contributions of how mindfulness may apply to an educational context, and offers recommendations for future research directions.We searched in the official home pages of the PubMed database using keyword search terms “mindfulness,” “meditation,” “default mode network,” “mind wandering,” “fMRI” or “EEG.” Titles and abstracts were selected for initial screening of articles for narrative review, whereas other studies on protocol that did not use fMRI and EEG were excluded. The previous studies on mindfulness have indicated that dispositional mindfulness levels are associated with mental health and alternations of brain structures or functions. Mindfulness training positively impacted mental health outcomes and ameliorated the symptoms of psychiatric diseases. Diseases such as depression and Alzheimer’s might be caused by inappropriate or aberrant activation of the DMN. This further leads to the internalizing of such disorders while negatively affecting mental health-related quality of life. Furthermore, fMRI studies have indicated the association between dispositional mindfulness or mindfulness training and decreased brain function activity. These include the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), PCC, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) for functional connectivity in the DMN region as well as increased connections between the brain network relevant to executive control or attention and the limbic system. That is, functional connections between the hippocampus and amygdala positively influenced the emotional and cognitive processing of the individual. Thus, mindfulness-based interventions contributed to greater mental health. Few studies have used EEG measurements. EEG studies have revealed that dispositional mindfulness or mindfulness training was associated with DMN network activity in the gamma and theta frequency bands. Therefore, mindfulness is associated with reduced activation of DMN. Collectively, the effectiveness of mindfulness for mental health is affected by changes in DMN, thereby improving normal functioning of the brain and behavioral performance. In addition, mindfulness training promotes the development of DMN core regions. Dispositional mindfulness or mindfulness training may promote moving away from mind wandering driven by DMN, thereby contributing to beneficial effects on brain functions. The current evidence thus may provide information about the potential benefits of mindfulness for people with mental health issues. Thus, meaningful mindfulness training could help individuals reset their habitually interfering or automatically distracting thoughts to become capable of keeping away from self-related ruminations and engaging in more focused awareness of the present moment. The research also proposed the potential effectiveness of mindfulness in child and adolescent development research in the field of education.Although previous studies have indicated the roles of DMN in mindfulness and mental health, these findings must be interpreted cautiously because of conceptual and methodological issues (e.g., lower bounds on sample size, lack of active controls, limited use in measurements and methods) in recent research on mindfulness. Therefore, methodological challenges should be addressed to improve the research design. Overall, these reviews provide significant research development trends with regard to neuroscience studies on mindfulness and DMN. The evidence suggests the following research method improvements: using more rigid research designs that adopt randomized controlled trials while including adequate sample sizes and using active control groups; factoring sample generalizability that includes accumulated knowledge derived from these results, which then should be applied for investigating the emerging field of neuroscience of mindfulness in a variety of populations; measuring the effects of mindfulness training and their applications since the impact of mindfulness training will be enhanced if there are relative emphasis assessments given to different components; and improved reviews of the extant literature of mindfulness and mental health associated with DMN functional connectivity, which is still not well understood. Future studies should focus on the mediation effects of DMN on mindfulness and behavioral performance outcomes as well as DMN and its role in individual behavior performance. Importantly, current evidence remains limited due to few studies being applied to different populations. Accordingly, future research should clarify the unacknowledged effects of mindfulness training on DMN.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2872,52.1,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Reliability and Validity of the Short-form Chinese- version Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales for Adolescent Students,Manying Hsieh,"social skills, reliability, validity, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)","This study examined the reliability and validity of the short-form Chinese version of the Social Skills Improvement System-Rating Scales (SSIS-RS) for adolescent students; SSIS-RS comprises two scales, each assessing social skills and problem behaviors. The research sample consisted of 1031 grade 7-12 students [515 boys and 516 girls; mean (standard deviation) age = 15.58 (1.75) years]. The Adolescent Social Behavior Scale Student Form was also applied ; moreover, AMOS (version 20.0) was used for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The Cronbach’s alpha and test–retest reliability values were respectively .74- .84 and .67- .85 for the social skill subscales and .70- .74 and .70- .76 for the problem behavior subscales. The CFA results revealed that the theoretical models presented good model fit, suggesting that the empirical data supported the hypothesized theoretical frameworks of the social skill and problem behavior scales. The social skills and problem behavior scale scores strongly correlated with the scores of the adaptive and maladaptive behavior scales of the Adolescent Social Behavior Scale Student Form, respectively. Moreover, the observed classification consistency was high between the original and the short-form version of the Chinese SSIS-RS for the current adolescent students. Taken together, the current results demonstrate good reliability and validity of the short-form Chinese version of SSIS-RS in adolescent students.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2860,51.4,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development of Taiwanese Pregnant Women Adjustment Scale,Yen-Chun Liu，Yen-Yu Chen,"quality of life, Taiwanese Pregnant Women Adjustment Scale, depression, confirmatory factor analysis","Pregnant women undergo considerable changes in terms of their bodies, emotions, and social roles and are at risk of stress and low quality of life. This study developed an adjustment scale for assessing Taiwanese pregnant women and examined the physical and psychological changes that occur during pregnancy to provide them with appropriate mental health services. On the basis of our literature review and practical experience as well as expert opinion, this study developed the first draft of Taiwanese Pregnant Women Adjustment Scale, comprising 58 items pertaining to the following six dimensions: physiological changes, psychological stress, negative emotions, positive emotions, quality of marriage, and social support. The scales’ development was divided into three stages: In the first stage, 166 pregnant women were recruited in the pilot study, and the collected data were analyzed through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and internal consistency analysis to develop a 38-item questionnaire. In the second stage, a valid sample comprising 653 pregnant women (sample A) was used to conduct a second EFA to develop the final 31-itme questionnaire. In the third stage, a valid sample comprising 656 pregnant women (sample B) was employed for confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The internal consistency coefficient Cronbach’s alpha for the whole scale and the six subscales ranged between .76 and .94, indicating their reliability. The CFA results also indicated that the model was supported by observed data, and the model’s stability was confirmed. The results supported the six-dimension model. Moreover, prenatal depression, three dimensions of quality of life, and adjustment during pregnancy were found to be strongly correlated, indicating criterion validities—consistent with previous results. Thus, the Taiwanese Pregnant Women Adjustment Scale has adequate reliability and validity and could be used to evaluate the degree of adjustment Taiwanese women undergo during pregnancy.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2861,51.4,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Multidimensional Affective Morality Scale: Development and Reliability and Validity Evaluation,Angela Chi-Ming Lee,"multidimensional affective morality (MAM) scale, reliability and validity, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), cross-validation, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA)","This study developed the Multidimensional affective morality (MAM) scale by testing its reliabilities and validity. On the basis of both national and global academic experiences and research achievements, this study selected students from junior high school to graduate school in Taiwan as subjects to construct a concrete indicator for affective morality and enhance the theory and practice of moral education. This study first explored the rationale underlying the scale’s draft. The researcher then examined the content validity and conducted the pretest and formal survey. Statistical analysis was performed utilizing the IBM SPSS Statistics (version 23) and AMOS Graphics (version 25). In Stage 1, an item analysis was performed and the internal reliability was computed for the pretest group sample (N = 585). Stage 2 comprised an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for pretest_1 group (N = 283). Stage 3 comprised a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for pretest_2 group (N = 302). In Stage 4, the cross-validation for the formal survey_ group was assessed (N = 708). The researcher developed two versions of the MAM scale. The long version, comprising 4 moral stories, 4 constructs, and 44 items, passed the test for content validity and internal consistency. The short version, comprising 3 moral stories, 3 constructs, and 12 items, demonstrated goodness of fit (a one-factor second-order CFA model) and good composite/component/construct reliability, construct validity, and cross-validity. The long version of the MAM scale demonstrated contextualization and richness, whereas the short one demonstrated structure and refinement. Thus, the MAM scale has the following characteristics: (1) The MAM scale has good richness and offered an in-depth understanding of the multiple dimensions of affective morality. (2) Similar to other related scales, the MAM scale demonstrated the concepts of affective morality. In addition, the scale encompassed localization and creativity pertaining to moral issues. (3) The MAM scale’s reliability and validity could be tested using various evaluation methods. Finally, the researcher offered several suggestions for the scale’s application and further research to improve the development of affective morality among students in different educational levels.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2862,51.4,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Preliminary Research on Ecological Characteristic Index of School Refusal from School Guidance Perspective,"Mei-Ling Hung，Li-Fei Wang, Cheng-Chang Lin，Tsai-Pei Chang","ecological index, school refusal, maintaining factors","This study explored the ecological characteristics and maintaining factors of Taiwan’s school refusal issues from the viewpoint of ecological systems, examining individual, family, and school aspects. An exploratory sequential mixed method research design was utilized in this study. First, qualitative interviews were conducted with four guidance teachers from Taiwan’s junior high schools. The qualitative data were analyzed using the categorical-content method to explore the ecological characteristics of school refusal phenomenon through individual, family, and school aspects. Thereafter, on the basis of the qualitative analysis results, a questionnaire was developed and administered among 239 guidance teachers from Taiwanese primary, junior high, and high schools. Descriptive statistics and principal component analysis were applied to analyze the quantitative data. The qualitative results highlighted the following ecological characteristics of Taiwan’s school refusal phenomenon: (1) the individual aspects entailed internal emotional states, external behaviors, physical symptoms, and need for psychological medication or special education; (2) the family aspects comprised relationship between parents, family relationships and expectations, parenting styles and regulations, and economic status and resources; and (3) the school aspect constituted student learning conditions, relationships with teachers, relationships with peers, and rules of a school system. The quantitative research results indicated the following ecological characteristics index of school refusal: (1) personal anxious avoidance, (2) familial overprotection and conflicts, (3) personal and familial over-expectations, (4) personal opposition and indolence, (5) inactivity and lack of motivation, and (6) school pressure and personal physical discomfort. Moreover, the quantitative research results demonstrated that the maintaining factors index of school refusal comprised the following: (1) class management challenges, (2) problems with cooperation within school system, (3) issues of personal daily routine and Internet management, (4) family anxiety toward school systems, (5) insufficient parental intervention against attacks from child, and (6) family lacking knowledge on school refusal.

Changes in Indicator Values of Speech Function Across Lifespan,Jing-Yi Jeng,"oral diadochokinetic (DDK) rate, spontaneous speech rate, speech function, fundamental frequency (F0), maximum phonation time (MPT)","This study investigated the differences on the indicator values related with four speech functions among eight age groups of Mandarin speakers, and explored the changes in speech functions across lifespan. This cross-sectional study explored the changes in speech functions with age. The following four functional indicators of speech were measured: maximum phonation time (MPT), fundamental frequency (F0), oral diadochokinetic (DDK) rates, and spontaneous speech rates. The study recruited 350 participants, comprising of eight age groups, including 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 9-, 12-year-old children, young adults and older adults. The participant age ranged from 4 to 83 years. The results demonstrated that MPT increased with age—from an average of 5 seconds in 4-year-old children to an average of 21 seconds in adult male group. The MPTs of the older adults were shorter, at an average of approximately 15 seconds. The F0 values of preschool and 7-year-old children demonstrated no significant gender difference; however, gender difference appeared in 9-year-old children. The results showed that the F0s of adult females were significantly higher than those of adult males. For both genders, the F0s decreased with age, except for the older adults. The F0s of older women continued to decline, whereas those of older males increased slightly. The DDK rates increased with age, with a mean of 3.25 syllable/s, and it was fastest among all groups (mean: 5.28 syllable/s); however, the DDK rates in older adults tended to decrease (mean: 4.70 syllable/s). Although the spontaneous speech rates were slightly slower than the DDK rates, the tendency of changing with age was common for both indicators. The speech rates were moderately correlated with the DDK rates, suggesting that both of them may share the same articulatory motor control mechanism. The change of these indicators suggests that speech function generally improves with age, in terms of phonatory–respiratory efficacy, mass of vocal folds, articulatory agility, and coordination; however, the speech functions were observed to decline for older adults.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2864,51.4,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development of Quality Scale for Outstanding Medical Educators and Analysis of Differences in Background Variables,Shao-Yin Chu，Po-Sheng Huang，Ching-Yuan Chang，Lieh-Yu Yi,"teaching, outstanding medical educator, medical education","Training by competent doctors is essential in medical education. Being taught by an outstanding medical educator not only provides medical students with access to clinical knowledge but also presents them with a role model for caring about patients and cooperating with other professionals, thus in turn facilitating the development of medical students into excellent doctors. Therefore, identifying the teaching qualities an outstanding medical educator should possess is integral to establishing an assessment criteria for evaluating outstanding teachers. A good medical educator can be evaluated as a physician, human, and teacher. As a physician, a good medical educator should have sufficient medical and clinical knowledge, enthusiasm for medicine, skills for treating patients, ability to maintain positive doctor–patient relationships, and academic research abilities, among other qualities. As a human, a good medical educator should prioritize the welfare of human beings and should be friendly, approachable, honest, respectful, humorous, empathetic, communicative, and reflective. As a teacher, a good medical educator should establish a learner-friendly teaching environment, show enthusiasm toward teaching, have good teaching skills, encourage students to actively participate in the learning process, carefully observe students and identify individual differences between them, have good relations with students, respond to students promptly, stimulate students’ interest in learning, monitor students’ progress, and make good use of constructive assessment and feedback. Kilukawa et al, (2013) adopted a focus group method to interview Japanese physicians on their perception of the characteristics of a good clinical educator. Of the 30 themes identified in the responses, 24 were categorized under the teacher perspective, including providing students with sufficient support, opportunities for thinking, feedback, indicators of required progress, and practice opportunities. The other six were categorized under the physician perspective, including enthusiasm for patient care, patience with patients, and emphasis on pathological reasoning. However, characteristics pertaining to the human perspective were not found. Studies have indicated that medical students in Eastern and Western countries may have varying perceptions of a good medical educator’s characteristics. Medical students in Western countries emphasize on the physician and human characteristics of medical educators; however, medical students in Eastern countries are more likely to emphasize on the teaching practice of medical educators. Cultural differences heavily influence medical students’ perception of the qualities medical educators should possess; hence, identifying the qualities recommended by different cultures is critical. In Taiwan, the lack of effective quantitative tools for assessing medical educators’ qualities presents an obstacle. Therefore, development of the said tools is warranted. This study developed a quality scale for outstanding medical educators to serve as reference for medical education quality assessment. The reliability and validity of the scale were verified. The scale also investigated the possible difference in how medical students from different backgrounds perceive the qualities of good teachers. On the basis of the literature review on good teacher qualities in the general and medical domain, the authors identified six teaching dimensions to use as measuring items. The original scale comprised 36 items, encompassing six major teaching dimensions, namely teaching planning (five items, including curriculum planning and course organization), teaching activities (eight items, including learning activities and resource development), teaching passion (six items), learning guidance (six items, including student coaching, mentoring, and providing constructive feedback), teacher support (five items, including teaching support and professional development), and multiple assessment (six items). In total, 162 medical students (79 men, 82 women, and 1 gender unknown) in Eastern Taiwan were invited to rate the perceived importance of the six items in reference to their teachers’ qualities. According to the results of the exploratory factor analysis and discrimination analysis [indicators of corrected item-total correlation and critical ratio (CR)], the authors removed the items in which factor loading and corrected item-total correlation were <.40 and those with a CR of <3. Finally, 26 items were retained for the final scale. Five, six, four, five, three, and three items were assigned to each teaching dimension, respectively. Furthermore, reliability testing demonstrated that the internal consistency coefficients of teaching planning, teaching activities, teaching enthusiasm, learning guidance, teacher support, and multiple assessment subscales were .877, .887, .853, .892, .818, and .794, respectively. During validity testing, a second-order confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the scale exhibited acceptable statistical fit and internal quality. This indicated the proposed scale’s validity and reliability. Moreover, the study results suggested the following: (1) Medical students perceived teaching passion and teaching activities as the most important dimensions, followed by teaching planning, multiple assessment, learning guidance, and teacher support, F(5, 805) = 31.98, p < .05, ɳ² = .166. The authors speculated that the differences in perceived importance between different dimensions could be attributed to the learning environment and expectations of medical educators. Medical students in Taiwan believe that it is difficult for educators to provide additional assistance to facilitate students’ learning and guidance when they have to be a teacher and a clinician simultaneously. Therefore, medical students perceived learning guidance and teacher support as less important. Instead, they placed more importance on educators providing good teaching quality in their teaching process. (2) Male and female medical students differed nonsignificantly in terms of their perceived importance of the six teaching dimensions, ts (159) < 1.12, ps > .05. (3) Medical students who were admitted through the Star Plan [t (160) = 2.45, p < .05] and those in higher grade levels [F(3, 158) = 3.00, p < .05, ɳ² = .054] perceived teacher support to be significantly more important compared with medical students who were admitted through personal applications or those in lower grade levels. The authors speculated that the difference between grades could be attributed to the medical curriculum planning. Senior medical students acquire more medical knowledge and require more practical clinical experience. Hence, teacher support is more critical to the learning process of higher grade students than that of lower grade students. Moreover, medical students who are enrolled through the Star Plan have a clear path for their medical career. They are more eager to obtain resources provided by educators and gain advanced medical knowledge and clinical technology than those enrolled through personal applications. Therefore, teacher support is essential for them. (4) Medical students who did not retake the entrance examination perceived teaching activities, teaching passion, and teacher support to be significantly more important compared with those who retook the entrance examination, ts (160) = 2.78, 2.54, and 2.55, respectively; all ps < .05. The authors speculated that previous unsuccessful experience of re-examination could be responsible for this. These students may attribute their learning success or failure in medical courses to their own ability or lack of effort instead of viewing it as a reflection of the educators’ qualities. Therefore, students who retook the entrance examination placed less emphasis on teaching activities, teaching passion, and teacher support. Finally, the implications and limitations of the study results were discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2865,51.4,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationship Among Family Socioeconomic Status and Maternal Parenting Efficacy, Preschoolers’ Adjustment, and Receptive Vocabulary Ability",Yin-Ping Teresa Teng,"maternal self-efficacy, preschooler’s adjustment, socioeconomic status, parenting factors, receptive vocabulary","Results showed that mothers from families with higher SES were more likely to be employed, raise fewer children, exhibit higher maternal parenting efficacy, and follow responsive parenting style. Moreover, their children presented better adjustment (mothers’ report) and receptive vocabulary ability. After all variables of this model were controlled for, family SES was found to have a direct positive impact on children’s receptive vocabulary ability, and the integrated responsive and demanding parenting style had a positive influence on children’s language ability. Furthermore, SES exhibited no significant relationship with children’s maladjustment. However, through the mediation of parenting efficacy, SES had a negative impact on children’s maladjustment. In addition, demanding parenting practices had a positive impact on children’s maladjustment (mothers’ report). In summary, SES was found to be intricately associated with maternal parenting efficacy, preschoolers’ adjustment, and receptive vocabulary ability in different processes. The current study’s results can provide a reference for future studies on maternal parenting efficacy, parenting factors, preschoolers’ adjustment, and receptive vocabulary ability.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2866,51.4,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Hence, this study first proposed a remedial program to develop the language component skills of low-achieving beginner-level EFL learners. Subsequently, the program’s effect on low-achieving learners’ vocabulary and grammar was measured. Finally, the study provided an overview of the remedial program’s characteristics , highlighting its instructional methods and materials, teaching procedures, activity designs, and approaches for enhancing learner engagement. This study recruited 11 teachers and 567 grade 7 students from six junior high schools in Taiwan. Two subtests, DCEC-Vocabulary Size and DCEC-Grammar of the Diagnosis and Certification of English Competency (DCEC) system, were conducted on all 567 seventh-graders. In total, 117 grade 7 students who failed to reach the grade 4 level were assigned into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group (N = 56) received experimental instruction, whereas the control group (N = 61) received traditional instruction. The study results indicated that the seventh-graders who received experimental remedial instruction demonstrated better English component skills, including better vocabulary and familiarity with grammatical sentence patterns , compared with students who received traditional instruction for remediation. The current study provided a model remedial program by delineating the implementation of remedial instruction for low-achieving beginner-level EFL learners.

Validation of the Scientific Imagination Test-Figural,Chia-Chi Wang,"Mental Imagery, Rasch Partial Credit Model, Scientific Imagination, Scientific Imagination Test-Figural","The present study aimed to validate the Scientific Imagination Test-Figural (SIT-Figural; Wang, Ho, & Cheng, 2016) for undergraduates using Rasch measurement. Furthermore, this study not only provided validating evidence concerning content validity, structural validity, generalizability, substantive validity, interpretation, and external validity (Wolfe & Smith, 2007) but also explored the relationship among scientific imagination, mental imagery, and other background variables (e.g., gender, grade, and college). Quantitative data were collected from 616 participants using the questionnaire, which was extracted fromthe SIT-Figural model.The SIT-Figural was designed to measure students’ scientific imagination through four types of tasks: A, B, C, and D. Additionally, these assignments in the scientific imaginative process comprised three dimensions: brainstorming, association,and transformation/elaboration. The Rasch partial credit model was used to assess the model–data fit; differential item functioning (DIF) analysis was conducted to examine the consistency of the ratings by gender and college. The results of DIF demonstrated that some items in the SIT-Figural showed a significant difference. Moreover, the three dimensions in the SIT-Figural indicated a positive model-data fit. The reliabilities of three subtests were 0.85, 0.84, and 0.83. The correlation coefficients between scientific imagination and mental imagery ranged from low to medium. Furthermore, a significant difference was found between scientific imagination and gender, grade, and college. In terms of scientific imagination, female students performed better than male students. Third-year students displayed better scientific imagination than freshmen and sophomores. Students from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the College of Digital Design possessed better abilities than those from the College of Engineering and the College of Business. Finally, suggestions for revising and applying the SIT-Figural were proposed for future research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2853,51.3,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A developmental study of children’s local and global coherence inference abilities,"Wan-Shin Chang, Yuh-Tsuen Tzeng","Global coherence, Inference, Local coherence","Comprehension is not a unitary process. Instead, in addition to many other cognitive skills, several types of inference abilities are required to construct a situation model from the text. Despite knowing developmental differences in students’ inferenceabilities for reading comprehension, definite conclusions on the relative developmental sequence of local and global coherence inference cannot be reached. For reading comprehension, local coherence inferences are needed to establish links between words and sentences (e.g., anaphor). Global coherence inferences are required for readers to go beyond the text and integrate it with their general knowledge to fill the missing details and understand the text as a whole. In this study, we examined the development of both local and global inferences between and across grade levels. In this study, six shortnarrative passages were selected, each constituting approximately 200 Chinese characters. We devised one literal, two local, and one global coherence inference questions for each text in the multiple-choice format. The results clearly showed thatboth fourth and fifth grade students performed better than third grade students for both types of inferences. Additionally, fifth grade students had higher scores than third and fourth grade students for local and global coherence inferences. Cluster analysis of the inferences across grades indicated that students’ performance was not solely determined by their grade. Individual differences within grades and similar patterns across grades were observed. Cluster analysis results showed the existence of four groups. The results confirmed that comprehension is a complex process and that not all subskills can bedeveloped simultaneously. Not all students with high global inference ability are good at making local coherence inferences. Individual differences in the patterns of inference abilities are revealing and call for more research attention. The patterns revealed in this study can also serve as good foundations for reading instructions that emphasize individual differences.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2854,51.3,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Why do students cheat? The conditional indirect effect of perceived classroom goal structures, personal achievement goals, and boredom on cheating","Shu-Ling Peng, Biing-Lin Cherng","Boredom, Cheating, Classroom goal structures, Conditional indirect effect, Personal achievement goals","Based on an integration of achievement goal theory and academic emotions theory, the present study explored personal and contextual aspects of the achievement goal theory for disclosing how the perceived classroom goal structures (CGS), personal achievement goals, and boredom jointly have an impact on cheating. Accordingly, the aims of this study were twofold: first, to test whether personal achievement goals have a mediating effect on cheating through boredom (i.e., to validate the mediation role of boredom between personal achievement goals and cheating); second, to test whether the above mediation relationship can be moderated by the two types of perceived classroom goal structures (i.e., mastery and performance goal structures). Methodologically, one large-scale survey in the subject of mathematics was administered to a sample of 626 7th~9th grade Taiwanese students, and the collected data were analyzed using the technique of structural equational modeling (SEM) for validating the conditional indirect effect. The results showed that both the mastery and performance goals have a negative effect on cheating through boredom, but the negative indirect effect of ""mastery goals → boredom → cheating"" is relatively strong. Also, it was revealed that the perceived classroom goal structures well moderate the indirect effect of “personal achievement goals → boredom → cheating.” When the adopted personal goals are consistent with the perceived contextual goals, the negative inhibition effect of the personal achievement goals on cheating through boredom will become stronger as the perceived CGS score increases. That is, as the score of mastery goal structuresincreases, the effect of the mastery goals on cheating through boredom is gradually enhanced; as the score of performance goal structures increases, the effect of the performance goals on cheating through boredom is gradually enhanced. However,when the adopted personal goals are inconsistent with the perceived contextual goals, different moderating effects will occur as a result of diverse CGS types and the level of CGS scores. That is, when students perceive a high level of mastery goal structure, as the score of mastery goal structure increases, the effect of performance goal on cheating through boredom will be produced. When students perceive a low level of performance goal structure, as the score of mastery goal structures increases, the effect of mastery goal on cheating through boredom is likely to occur. Based on the reported results, several suggestions were proposed to not only inform the instruction and counseling practice of junior high school education, but also shed valuable light for future research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2855,51.3,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Regional Homogeneity Correlates with Mathematical and Scientific Talent and Intelligence Quotient,"Ching-Lin Wu, Ching-Chih Kuo","Regional homogeneity, Intelligence, Mathematical and scientific talent, Resting-state","Mathematical and scientific talented (MST) students are often to thought to those who have high intelligence (IQ). Recently, many studies evaluating the neurological mechanism underlying mathematical and scientific talent indicate that certain talents are associated with different brain structures. Furthermore, white matter microstructure is connected differently in cases of mathematical and scientific talent and intelligence. However, research evaluating the relationship between MST, IQ, and gray matter microstructure using the method of regional homogeneity is rare. To address this issue, sixteen MST individuals with average age 20.91 (SD = 1.75) and 14 typically developed undergraduate with average age 21.72 (SD = 0.92) were recruited to participate this research. Participants were recruited from the Departments of Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Medicine, and Life Science and the Department of Bio-resources and Agriculture of Taiwanese universities. The participants were assessed intelligence using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III and a resting-state brain approach. The present study was reviewed and approved by theResearch Ethics Center of Taipei Medical University of Taiwan. All the participants signed an informed consent before the experiment began. The results demonstrated that for both the MST and control groups, intelligence and regional homogeneity were positively correlated with the middle frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, and thalamus. After controlling for the influence of age and IQ, the local efficiencies of the frontal, parietal and temporal lobes, cingulate cortex, insula, and thalamus were higher in the MST group than those in the control group. These results are consistent with portions ofthe parieto-frontal integration theory that postulate that math-and science and intelligence work together in some brain regions, but operate independently in others. The findings of the present study contribute to a further understanding of the different traits between high IQ and math- and science as well as way to identify different kinds of talents.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2857,51.3,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"The Relationship between Adolescents´ Creative Self-efficacy, Competition Engagements and the Value of Participating in Competition-aking the IEYI International Exhibition for Young Inventors as an Example","Jon-Chao Hong, Mei-Lien Chen, Jian-Hong Ye, Po-Hsi Chen","Competition engagements, Competition value, Creative self-efficacy, International Exhibition for Young Inventors","Innovation entails the transformation of creativity into value. Innovation abilities are increasingly important and need to be valued and promoted in the current educational environment. To understand the role of students’ creative self-efficacy in practical competitions, this study explored the relevance of students’ participation in active competition and participation in the International Exhibition for Young Inventors (IEYI).Participants chose the work category attached to the value and created ideas between the work and the selected category, affirming the competition’s value through self-efficacy and engagements. This study collected data from 254 students and performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) through AMOS 20. All items in this study were different, that is, they could be used to investigate the response of the study sample. The average variation extraction ranged from 0.57 to 0.66, which was greater than 0.50; the factor load of each item ranged from 0.65 to 0.87, which was greater than 0.50. Therefore, the study data all met the test criteria of convergence validity and construct validity. In the study data, the combined reliability of each facet was above 0.899, which was greater than 0.70; the Cronbach’s αvalue of each facet ranged from 0.896 to 0.923, which met the criteria of internal consistency reliability. The acceptability model constructed in this study had statistically obtained indicators of χ2 = 497.1, df = 246, χ2/df = 2.02, RMSEA = 0.06, GFI= 0.86, AGF I= 0.83, NFI = 0.91, CFI = 0.94, IFI = 0.94, RFI = 0.91, PNFI = 0.79, PGFI = 0.71. The aforementioned indicators were in line with the verification criteria, showing that this model is suitable for analyzing all paths of this data construction. The hypotheses established in this study were all accepted; the creative self-efficacy was positively correlated with three types of competition engagement, comprising cognition, emotion, and behavior. Additionally, the three types of competition engagement were positively correlated with competition value. The cognitive input explanatory power was 62%, the emotional input explanatory power was 73%, the behavior input explanatory power was 79%, and the value explanatory power of participating in IEYI was 76%. The results showed that young peoples’ creative self-efficacy, competitionengagements, and the value of competition participation had a good fit and intrinsic quality, which verified the relevant acceptance model.The study findings suggest that students’ creative self-efficacy can be caused by the hands-on process of competition participation, such as participation in IEYI. This study further improves our understanding of relationship dynamics by showing that three types of competition engagement can promote or inhibit participants’ competition value. Compared with previous studies, this study’s results seem to have a more meaningful combined impact on the value of competition participation. The study results have two main contributions: first, the research proposes that creative self-efficacy of invention creation is an important trait; second, previous research has confirmed that creative self-efficacy can improve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement of competition and enhance the value of competition participation.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2858,51.3,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploring the Effects of Phonological Processing on Foreign-Language Reading: An Eye-Tracking Study for Chinese Learners of Japanese-as-a-Foreign-Language,Ying-Hua Gua,"Eye-tracking, Foreign language reading, Linear mixed models, Phonological processing","This study explored the effects of phonological processing on text comprehension and word processing in a group of advanced Chinese students learning Japanese-as-a-foreign-language (JFL). Participants’ reading performance and global- and word-level eye-movement patterns were compared under five reading conditions: articulatory suppression, read-aloud, concurrent reading while listening to the text or to an irrelevant speech, and silent reading. In addition, the study examined whether text complexity moderates participants’ phonological processing when reading Japanese text. Finally, how participants’ Chinese knowledge affects their processing of Japanese words written in different script types was investigated through analysis of their word-level eye-movement behavior. The results indicated that participants could comprehend shortJapanese texts without relying much on phonological recoding: Articulatory suppression and reading while listening to an irrelevant speech did not significantly impair reading comprehension nor did read-aloud and reading while listening to the text enhance text comprehension. Text complexity did not reliably moderate participants’ phonological processing under thereading conditions. The word processing results showed that participants’ Chinese knowledge facilitated their processing of Chinese-Japanese cognates (i.e., kanji existing both in Chinese and Japanese with the same meanings) but not the processing of Chinese-Japanese homographs or Japanese-coined kanji words. The fact that reading while listening to the text tended to only facilitate the processing of kana words but not the Chinese-Japanese cognates suggests that phonological recoding might not be necessary for accessing the Chinese–Japanese cognates’ meanings but is essential for the processing of words written in kana.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2859,51.3,2020,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Facebook Makes Me Happier? The Effects of Realistic and Online Interaction on Subjective Well-Being and Their Mediating Variable,"Chao-Jun Yang, Chin-Lung Chien","Facebook use, Friendship, Need to belong, Relationship quality, Subjective well-being","Interpersonal interaction is closely related to subjective well-being (SWB), but with the rise of social network sites (e.g., Facebook (FB)), a new form of interpersonal interaction has emerged. Taking FB as an example, this study examined the effects of realistic (face-to-face) and online (FB) interaction on SWB and tested the mediating effect of relationship quality. Previous research studies on the effect of Facebook use on SWB have revealed very inconsistent results (the so-called “Facebook paradox”). Our paper has exhaustively reviewed previous studies and proposed that FB interaction, defined as active and reciprocal interaction with friends through FB, as a type of Facebook use might be beneficial to SWB. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, and 412 participants (including students and non-students) filled in the scales of realistic interaction, online (FB) interaction, friendship quality, and SWB. Among them, 38 cases who were not FB usersand/or showed response sets were excluded from further analysis. Using structural equation modeling, the data were analyzed among the valid sample (241 females, 136 males). The Sobel test and the bootstrapping method with 5000 bootstrap samples were used to test the significance of the mediating effects. The results showed that: (1) realistic interaction with friends has a significant positive effect on SWB, acting through the mediating variable friendship quality; (2) controlling for the effect of realistic interaction, online (FB) interaction with friends still has a significant positive effect on SWB, acting through the mediator friendship quality; and (3) both realistic and FB interaction have fairly equal effects on friendship quality, through a model comparison approach. We conclude that FB interaction is beneficial to SWB, beyond the effect of realistic interaction. Thus, our study provides one solution to the Facebook paradox and thus contributes to issues relating to FB interaction. Implications, limitations, and future directions are also discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2851,51.2,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Validation Study of Bi-factor Structure of Chinese Nurses Burnout with ESEM,"Yan Zhao Y, Lawrence Wang, Chi-Hung Wang","Bi-factor Model, Burnout, Exploratory Structural Equation Model, Nurses","This study validated the bi-factor structural construct of the Nursing Burnout Scale (NBS) by using a stratified sample of 523 nurses from Jiang Shu, China, who completed the short version of the NBS survey in Chinese. Mplus software (version 8.1) provided the statistical outputs for all analyses conducted in this study. The findings for four alternative burnout constructs-single-, three-, high-order, and bi-factor models-employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM) approaches improved our understanding of work burnout among nurses in the hospitals in China. Statistical comparison among a series of nested CFA and ESEM models revealed that a bi-factor model with a global burnout factor and three content-specific factors-emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA)-involving the ESEM approach outperformed all other models in terms of the model data fit. Only global burnout factor and the content-specific DP factor explained the considerable unique proportion of variance in the observed scores. The content-specific factors EE and PA only explained a small unique proportion of variance in the observed scores. The findings support the bi-factor structure of the NBS that was originally proposed by Mészáros et al. in Hungary (2014). Moreover, the findings provide insights into understanding the cross-culture and cross-situation factorial consistency of nursing burnout. Compared with CFA, ESEM is a better approach for validating the bi-factor factorial structure. The findings improve our understanding of the complexity of the multidimensional structure of job burnout among nurses. Moreover, the proposed method provides hospital administrators with the total burnout score to ensure timely intervention for the staff who are at risk. However, the EE and PA scores should be interpreted carefully because these scores reflect a very small proportion of the burnout content. Further investigation on invariance measurement based on gender and time will provide insights into the generalizability of the bi-factor nursing burnout structure.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2846,51.2,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Ethical Judgment Process for Employee Assistance Program Professionals on Confidentiality Issues,"Su-Hui Chang, Jin-Fong Chuang, Chih-Hung Wang","Confidentiality, Employee assistance programs, Ethical conflicts, Ethical impact, Ethical judgment","This study explored the ethical judgment process of employee assistance program (EAPs) professionals on confidentiality issues. In-depth interviews were conducted with six EAPs professionals within the company, and the “category content” strategy was used for conducting qualitative analysis in the narrative study. The study found that EAPs professionals within the company have different types of confidentiality issues and experience the conflict, judgment, and impact stages of the ethical judgment process. First, the following confidentiality issues are encountered in the conflict stage: (1) the involvement of administrative forces in the operation of EAPs, thus leading to a confidentiality dilemma, (2) the differences in the attitudes of the parties toward the perception of confidentiality, and (3) the conflicts in the consideration of the confidential exception and the duty to warn. Second, in the judgment stage, EAPs professionals within the company make ethical judgments and decisions based on five aspects: (1) by using the EAPs code of ethics, (2) by considering whether the rights of the client are harmed, (3) by considering the optimal welfare of the client, (4) by evaluating and initiating related resource assistance, and (5) by considering the informed consent aspect in the decision for the parties. Third, in the impact stage, EAPs professionals within the company seek support from the support system and develop their adjustment methods: (1) internal self-adjustment, (2) inquiry pertaining to the external support system assistance, (3) redefining of the EAPs service function, (4) adjustment and coping strategies, and others. These processes will continue to precipitate and reflect, gradually forming the next treatment experience and judgment of ethical conflict events. Finally, based on the research results, this study also proposed relevant suggestions for the practical development of EAPs and the future research of the ethical issues of these programs.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2848,51.2,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Domain Specificity of Perfectionism: Depends on Whom and What the Domains Being Examined,"Ting Shao Hsu, Wei-Su Hsu, Jun Ren Lee","Domain-specific, Gender differences, Perfectionism","This study examined the concept of perfectionism pertaining to universality or domain specificity and observed the influence of gender on this concept. The Chinese version of the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised was used as the perfectionism index. We measured perfectionism in a certain domain by inserting the leading sentence to the questions of Almost Perfect Scale-Revised, for example, in sports. In the first study, athlete and nonathlete college students were recruited as participants. The study and sports domains were examined. This study found that the influences of the type of domain, type of participant, and gender at high standards were significant. Significant interaction was observed between the type of participants and the type of domains and gender. In a correlation analysis, a correlation was observed between the study and sports domains for nonathlete students but not for athlete participants, irrespective of the high standards or discrepancies present. No correlations were observed between the study and sports domains in terms of gender for high standards. However, a correlation was observed between study and sports domains for discrepancies for female participants. Factor analysis revealed two factors for athlete students but only one factor for nonathlete participants. The first study observed the differences between different domains in terms of the high standards and the unrelated phenomenon between the domains supported perfectionism as domain specificity, but the correlation between high standards between domains, and the result of a single factor for the non-athlete participants supports perfectionism as domain general. The second study further examined this topic pertaining to the life and study domains of college students. We observed a difference between the study and life domains in terms of the high standard scores. However, no differences were observed among genders, and there was no interaction between the gender and domain aspects. The correlational analysis revealed a significant correlation between life and study domains in terms of high standards and discrepancy for female participants but not for male participants. The factor analysis results presented a single factor. According to the results of this study, we suggested that the domain-general and domain-specific issues can be considered based on the perceived importance of the examined domain to participants and the characteristics of participants.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2845,51.2,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Survey on the Current Internship Training and Supervision in Counseling Psychology,"Cheng-Tseng Lin, Chia-Hsin Lin","Clinical supervision, Intern counseling psychologists, Internship, Supervision orientations","This survey study investigated the current conditions of counseling psychology internship training and the experiences of supervisors and interns in their supervision relationships. The participants of this study were intern counseling psychologists and their clinical supervisors. The researcher contacted 158 internship programs or sites, and 95 of them agreed to participate in this study. Moreover, 360 questionnaires were distributed to 180 pairs of supervisors and full-time intern psychologists. The exclusion of unmatched individual participants’ and invalid questionnaires provided a total of 103 usable supervision dyads, and 206 valid questionnaires were collected successfully. The effective response rate was 57.22%. The questionnaire was designed to understand the variation in the allocation of training hours and assigned tasks as well as the chief complaints by clients across different training sites. The questionnaire also included items to investigate the experiences of interns while receiving supervision, the satisfaction levels pertaining to supervision for both supervisors and interns, and the theoretical orientation or approaches adopted by the supervisors. The findings of this study are as follows: (a) the intern psychologist participants in this study reported an average client load of 7.76 h per week and 285.1 h annually, and the supervision hourswere 1.5 h per week. (b) The appointed tasks and chief client complaints varied with the training sites. For instance, significant differences were found across different sites on task items such as “couple and family counseling,” “intake,” “workshop and lecture,” “mental health promotion,” and “in-class outreach.” (c) In this study, 46.2% of the clinical supervisors recruited into the current study were accredited by the Taiwan Counseling Psychology Association or the Taiwan Guidance and Counseling Association, 67.9% of them had been in practice for more than 10 years, and the experience duration of the participants as clinical supervisor ranged from 4 to 10 years. (d) The top-three most frequently adopted theoretical approaches are “experiential” (35.9%), “post-modernist” (20.4%), and “psychodynamic” (14.6%). (e) The supervisors in the medical settings were less experienced than their counterparts in the community or school setting. However, their supervision hours exceeded the hours of supervisors in the community or school setting. (f) Overall, both supervisors and intern psychologists reported a high level of satisfaction with their supervision experiences. Specifically,50.5% of the intern psychologists reported that they were “very satisfied” with their experiences of receiving supervision, and 35% of them reported that they were “satisfied.” Moreover, 27.25% of the supervisors reported that they were “very satisfied” with their experience of delivering supervision, and 65.6% of them reported that they were “satisfied.” (g)Supervisors’ theoretical orientations had significant influence on their evaluation of interns’ performance and competence. Supervisors adopting a relational or experiential approach tend to rate interns higher on the scale than those who adopt a cognitive–behavioral orientation. The findings of this survey were then analyzed and discussed. Based on our discussion, the implications on future research and clinical training in counseling psychology are described.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2849,51.2,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Novice Counselor Educator’s Action Research on Teaching: An Undergraduate Counseling Practicum Course Based on Awareness and Reflexivity-focused Training,"Chao-Mei Chiang, Ying-Yi Su","Action research, Awareness and reflexivity, Counselor education, Self-awareness Supervision Model, Undergraduate counseling practicum course","This action research was initiated from the aspect of a researcher’s reflection on being a novice counselor educator. The researcher in this study was the instructor of an undergraduate level practicum for the first time and reflected on the manner in which this course should be arranged based on the guidance and counseling professional development context in Taiwan, professional development requirements of students, connecting course instruction, students’ learning, and professional practices. This study aimed to develop a course plan for undergraduate counseling practicum in terms of the Taiwanese context. Data collection was conducted using three focused group interviews that were conducted at the beginning of the course, in the middle of the course, and 3 months after the end of the course. As the researcher was an instructor and a supervisor of the course, all the interviews were conducted by research assistants who received focused group interview training in order to ensure individual participants’ rights protected. The researcher did not access the research data until the participants’ grades of the course were submitted. An inductive analysis was used for data analysis. The observations and findings obtained during the action research were as follows.

Positive affect creative self-efficacy on the ability and confidence to predict problem solving avoidance motivation in a digital advertisement design course,"Jon-Chao Hong, Jian-Hong Ye, Ya-Yun Shih","Creative self-efficacy, Problem-solving avoidance motivation, Project design, Positive affect, Vocational high school students","A successful goal-achieving behavior in a design-based learning environment requires a balance between positive emotions and creative self-efficacy. However, most past studies related to the field of design education have emphasized learners’ creativity and creative performance. However, few studies have discussed avoiding motivation. To understand the influence of positive affect and creative self-efficacy on the problem-solving motivation in the context of design practice, this study explored an advertisement design course and categorized self-reported self-efficacy into confidence and ability for predicting the problem-solving motivation. Based on the mood-as-information model, which states that individuals’ positive mood influence their cognitive processes in problem solving, this study explored the levels of psychological traits and states, such as positive affect, creative self-efficacy in ability, creative self-efficacy in confidence, and problem-solving avoidance motivation in digital advertisement design. Sixty-six students majoring in advertising design at a technical high school were recruited for this study, and the average age of the participants was 17.8 years. They were asked to fill out a questionnaire after completing the project design course task. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the collected data by using structural equation modeling, and a positive relationship was found between positive affect and both ability and confidence in creative self-efficacy. The two types of creative self-efficacy were negatively related to problem-solving avoidance motivation. For instance, the findings revealed that people with a high level of creative self-efficacy were less likely to face challenging problems. However, the students with a high level of motivation avoidance in terms of problem solving who had to complete a project may have less motivation to continue design improvement. By understanding these relationships appropriately, teachers can be in a better position to enhance the positive affect and the two types of creative self-efficacy of vocational high school students when they are involved in project design that can decrease their avoidance motivation to solve problems.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2850,51.2,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationships among Parental Involvement, Science Motivation and Science Achievements of Junior High School Students in Rural Towns","Man-ying Hsieh,Ching-Yuan Chang","Science Achievements, Science Motivation, Parental Involvement, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)","This study explored the relationships among parental involvement, science motivation and one-year later science achievements of the junior high school students in rural towns in Taiwan. The research subjects consisted of 425 8th grade junior high school students, including 221 males and 204 females. The mean age of the students was 14.36 years, with a standard deviation of 0.48. The parental involvement and positive parenting subscales of the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire Child Form (APQ-Child Form) as well as the Junior High School Student Science Motivation Scale were used in the study. The software IBM SPSS 18 and AMOS 20 were used for analyzing the data. The structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques were used to evaluate the hypothesized theatrical model, and a two-stage analysis strategy was applied. The fit of the measurement model was estimated in the first phase, and the fit of the structural equation model was estimated in the second stage. Moreover, multiple group analysis was applied in order to evaluate gender differences, and bootstrapping was applied in order to examine the mediation effects of science motivation. The study results offered support for the theoretical relationships among parental involvement, science motivation and science achievements. The multiple group analysis results provided support for the gender invariance of the hypothesized theatrical model, and the bootstrap results confirmed the partially mediating role of science motivation in the relationship between parental involvement and science achievements. In summary, the results demonstrated that parental involvement can impact their children’s science motivation, which in turn can improve the school’s success in science education one year later for the junior high school students living in rural towns. The findings were consistent with Coleman’s theory of social capital and provided evidence that supports Grolnicks and Slowiaczek’s motivational model. Based on the above results, some suggestions were proposed for improving students´ science motivation in rural towns.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2838,51.1,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Meta-Analysis of the Learning Effects of Flipped Classroom on Elementary School and Junior High School Students,"Ming-Cheng Yen,Bao-Yuan Huang","Meta-analysis, Learning effects, Flipped classroom","The purpose of this study was to investigate the learning effects of flipped classrooms on elementary school and junior high school students in Taiwan. The data were analyzed according to the method of Hedges and Olkin (1985) and other technology of meta-analysis. The keywords “flipped classroom,” “flipped teaching,” and “flipped learning” were used to search for relevant theses in the Taiwanese Master’s thesis system. A total of 49 relevant theses, including 48 in the cognition domain and 31 in the affective domain, were obtained. The theses were analyzed on the overall weighted mean effect size (Hedges´ g), homogeneity by using Cochrane’s Q, and publication bias by using a funnel plot and the trim and fill method. Categorical model analysis was performed on the theses by using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3.0 software, which was designed by Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, and Rothstein. The conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) Flipped classrooms positively influence learning effects for elementary school and junior high school students in Taiwan. The effect size for the cognition domain was 0.308, which equaled Cohen’s small effect. The effect size for the affective domain was 0.517, which equaled Cohen’s medium effect. (2) Moderator variables influence the learning effects of flipped classrooms on elementary school and junior high school students in Taiwan. Moderator variables of the learning effects of the cognitive domain include subjects, types of e-learning platforms, self-learning materials, self-learning inspection mechanisms, student-centered instructions, and elapsed teaching time. Moderator variables of the learning effects of the affective domain include students of different grades, subjects, types of e-learning platforms, self-learning materials, self-learning inspection mechanisms, student-centered instructions, and elapsed teaching time.

"The relationship between teacher reading instruction and students’ reading performance in the past ten years of Taiwan: Evidence from PIRLS 2006, 2011 and 2016",Ming-lei Chen,"PIRLS, Reading instruction, Reading performance","The reading performance of fourth-grade students in Taiwan has shown a trend of improvement since PIRLS 2006 to PIRLS 2016. Theoretically, because of the teachers’ day-to-day reading instruction in classroom, teachers have inevitably taken a key role in affecting the reading performance of the students. So far, little is known on relationship between the reading instruction and student reading performance in Taiwan. Therefore, the current study focused on the impact of activities of teacher reading instruction in Taiwan on the reading outcomes of students. By analyzing the ten-year PIRLS data, the present study can not only understand which aspects of teachers’ factors play key role on students reading performance, but also serve as an important empirical evidence for formulating future reading education policies.The linear mixed model was used to analyze the main effects of different teaching frequencies on students’ different reading performance. And the interaction between different teaching frequencies and the survey year. In three surveys, a total of 482 Taiwanese teachers completed the teacher questionnaire and 13,208 fourth-grade students in Taiwan completed the reading comprehension test. Each student has five reading grades, which are total score, story score, explanatory text score, direct understanding of grades, and interpretation of comprehension scores. There are five major questions in the questionnaires for teachers´ indoor reading teaching in three surveys, namely: (1) how often teachers use different types of grouping for reading instruction, (2) how frequently teacher asked their students to read various types of literary and informational texts, (3) how often frequently teacher teaching language skills, (4) how often frequently teacher asked their students to practice reading strategies in teachers’ reading instruction (5) how often frequently teacher asked their students to do various types of responses after students reading a text.It was found that teachers preferred the “small grouping type” than “whole-class” in PIRLS 2016 survey, but there were no effects of grouping type on students’ reading performance. However, when teacher more frequently asked students: to read longer fiction books with chapters, silent reading, and oral response on reading materials, the better performance of the reading scores of the students. It is worth noting that the frequency of reading skills or strategies teaching in teachers’ reading instruction does not affect students´ reading performance. Only in PIRLS 2016, when teachers more frequently asked students to make generalization and draw inferences, the better performance of the expository reading scores of the students. These findings are discussed in relation to reading education policy and the literature on instructional contexts.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2840,51.1,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Perceived Teacher Feedbacks, Personal Achievement Goals, and Academic Self-efficacy on Boredom: The Mediation Effect and Conditional Indirect Effect",Shu-Ling Peng,"Perceived teacher feedbacks, Personal achievement goals, Conditional indirect effect, Boredom, Academic self-efficacy","The study, grounded on the control-value theory of academic emotion, examined how the contextual factors (i.e., the perceived teacher feedbacks) and personal (i.e., the personal achievement goals and academic self-efficacy) factor have impact on boredom. Accordingly, the objectives of the present study are twofold: firstly, to construct four mediation models for investigating the relationship among the perceived teacher feedbacks, personal achievement goals, and boredom (i.e., “the perceived self-reference feedbacks → mastery-approach goal → boredom”, “the perceived self-reference feedbacks → mastery-avoidance goal → boredom”, “the perceived normative-reference feedbacks → performance-approach goal → boredom”, and “the perceived normative-reference feedbacks → performance-avoidance goal → boredom”); secondly, to test whether the above mediation relations can be moderated by the academic self-efficacy. Methodologically, a math survey was conducted with 1105 participants of 7th grade students in Taiwan, and the researcher analyzed the collected data using the technique of structural equation modeling (SEM) to test both the mediation effect and conditional indirect effect. The results showed that the two mediation models of “the perceived self-reference feedback → mastery-approach goal → boredom” and “the perceived normative-reference feedback → performance-avoidance goal → boredom” were supported by the observed data, which adequately captures the relationship among the perceived teacher feedbacks, personal achievement goals, and boredom. Specifically, mastery-approach goal fully mediates the prediction of the perceived self-reference feedback on boredom, and performance-avoidance goal fully mediates the prediction of the perceived normative-reference feedback on boredom. Also, it was found that the academic self-efficacy well moderates the negative indirect effect of “the perceived self-reference feedback → mastery-approach goal → boredom.” In other words, when the level of individual’s academic self-efficacy is gradually increasing, the inhibition effect that the perceived self-reference feedbacks with individuals’ adoption of mastery-approach goals pose on boredom increases. Based on the findings, relevant recommendations were proposed for further research, teaching practices, and junior high school counseling.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2841,51.1,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploring the Process of Generating Group Creativity within a Science Teacher Group,"Chia-Yu Liu,Wei-Wen Lin,Chao-Jung Wu","Scientific creative teaching, Teacher learning group, Group creativity","Creative teaching is becoming essential in sparking student’s interests and enhancing their performances. To improve teaching, teacher learning group is a good way to support teacher competence development. However, few studies have focused on how teachers make effective dialogue and generate creativity with others within a teacher learning group. Thus,we adapted Csikszentmihalyi’s systems model to reveal the way of the dialogue within a middle school science teaching group affected the developing process of group creativity. The mixed-method approach was adopted and data from video recordings and semi-structured interview during 2016-2017 were collected. We used constant comparative analysis to analyze the data. First, twenty-eight dialogue elements of group creativity in first order and nine in second order were identified. Next, a serial of Mann-Whitney U tests was conducted to examine the general and unique dialogue elements. After modifying by the interview data, the Interactional Group Creativity Model was constructed. In this model, group members would discuss fluently with the general dialogue elements. Furthermore, group creativity would be promoted with the unique dialogue elements, which are contained in five stages: 1. Goal-oriented context stage: Group members achieve shared understanding in group goals and directions; 2. Expanding stage: Group members demonstrate multiple teaching ideas proposing, alternative solution raising, and teaching resources sharing to broaden the group’s thinking and knowledge; 3. Understanding stage: Group members perform illustration seeking, explaining, and feedback to reinforce group’s knowledge basis in this stage; 4. Suspending stage: By distracting their attentions temporarily, group members consider more possibilities and developed appropriate ideas; 5. Information elaborating stage: Within the spiral circulation of the two stages, ideas and information are elaborated through contextualization and combination. It is noteworthy that the five stages are nonlinear but circles that might be generated within single or multiple stages. Group creativity developed and elaborated in the spiral circulation between the five stages. Based on the results, relevant empirical and theoretical research have been discussed, and the practical suggestions for scientific teacher groups have also been proposed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2842,51.1,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Shared Book Reading Practices on Child Development in the Context of Taiwanese Families: Applying Data from Kids in Taiwan Study,"Chia-Hui Lin,Huei-Mei Liu,Chien-Ju Chang","Child development, Socio-economic status, Structural equation modeling, Shared book reading","In this study, we used the data from the study of Kids in Taiwan: National Longitudinal Study of Child Development and Care to understand parent-child shared book reading practices in Taiwan and the association between home environment factors, such as socio-economic status and childcare operation, and shared book reading practices as well as between shared book reading practices and children’s development in cognition, language, and socio-emotions when they were 36 months old. The total number of children who participated in this study was 2,164. This study found that about two thirds of the parents read books to their children at least once a week, and one-third of the parents never read to their children or read to them less than once a week. Moreover, using structural equation modeling analysis, three latent variables were constructed, namely the socio-economic status, shared book reading practices, and the development of the child. The results indicated that socio-economic status had a significant relation with shared book reading practices. The β value was 0.6, which indicated that the socio-economic status factor could explain 36% variation of shared book reading practices. Furthermore, shared book reading practices had a β value of 0.51 (i.e., explaining 28% variation) for its relation with the development of the child. Socio-economic status, however, exhibited an insignificant relation with the development of the child. In this sense, shared book reading practices mediated the relationship between the socio-economic status and the development of the child. Shared book reading practices exhibited the highest effect on the cognitive memory development of a child and had a large effect on the language expression and emotional development of the child. In this study, we also compared different subgroups to investigate the existence of moderating factors and found that the respondent types (father or mother), child’s gender, and birth order did not have any moderating effect on the causal model. Noninvariance of structural weights was observed in three subgroups of childcare operations. A stronger relation between the socio-economic status and shared book reading practices was observed for parents who did not use any childcare services (i.e., children who were cared by their own parents full time) than for parents who used childcare services less than 10 hours per day and parents who used childcare services 11-24 hours per day. The effects of shared book reading practices on the child’s development was the largest for the group using 11-24 hours of childcare services but was the least for the group that did not use childcare services. This result may imply that shared book reading practices can improve the child’s development most effectively though parents who can only spend limited time with their children.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2843,51.1,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Personal And Environmental Factors Affecting Students’ Digital Reading Performance: Exploring Data from the PIRLS 2016,"Yu-wen Chang,Hwa-wei Ko","Print reading, Home resources for learning, Digital use, Digital reading, Reading confidence","The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of personal factors (print reading performance, gender, and reading confidence, and self-efficacy for computer use) and environmental factors (home resources for learning, digital devices in the home, and digital use) on digital reading performance in primary students. The data of 69507 fourth graders from 13 countries participating in the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) 2016 were examined. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were conducted by the IEA IDB Analyzer software version 4. The results showed that print reading performance, reading confidence, self-efficacy for computer use, home resources for learning, digital devices in the home, and digital use as predictors, the regression line can explain 49%-73% the variation of digital reading performance. Print reading ability can explain 60% variance in digital reading performance, which suggested that processes readers use to comprehend digital text are similar to what is required to comprehend print text. It also suggested that digital reading requires a different set of skills from those required to read the print text. Most countries in the study, girls have outperformed boys in print reading and digital reading. When holding print reading performance constant across genders, gender gaps are no longer statistically significant. This means that digitalization does not exacerbate gender inequality. Home resources for learning can explain 14% and 16% variation respectively in digital and print reading performance. The indirect association (through the effect of home resources for learning on print reading skills) accounts for most of the variation, the direct association accounts for 0.6-2.3% of the variation. Increasing in reading confidence of 1 point could increase in the digital reading of 16 points while increasing in self-efficacy for computer use of 1 point, the increase in digital reading is only 4 points. This suggests the importance to boost students’ reading confidence. The relationship between digital use and digital reading skills varies across countries and the activities for which student use computers. What students do with ICT are more important than digital access to them.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2844,51.1,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Positive Psychology Interventions on Well-Being and Depression: A Meta-Analysis,"Jing-Hua Chen, Min-Ning Yu","Depression, Meta-analysis, Positive psychology interventions, Well-being","Positive psychology research has been developing continuously for the past few years and has become a focus of research attention worldwide. The effects of positive psychology interventions have been examined by Sin and Lyubomirsky (2009; 1977–2008) and Bolier et al. (2013; 1998–2012). The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of positive psychology interventions on well-being and depression. The study time was defined as 2013–2017. The present study undertook a systematic literature search using the PerioPath Index to the Taiwan Periodical Literature System, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A total of 47 articles describing 48 studies met the criteria for inclusion. The studies concerned a total of 10,652 participants, 4,509 of which were in control groups. Primary outcomes were subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and depression. Positive psychology interventions included individual interventions and group training. Recruitment was conducted both online and offline. Positive psychology interventions that were used were gratitude interventions, strengths interventions, forgiveness interventions, engagement and flow interventions, savoring interventions, and meaning-oriented interventions. The results revealed that (1) the effect size of the fixed effect model was 0.309 for subjective well-being, 0.451 for psychological well-being, and 0.376 for depression. Positive psychology interventions had a low to moderate positive effect. At follow-up from 1 to 6 months, the effect size was still significant for subjective well-being and depression, indicating that the effects were fairly sustainable. Additionally, the results revealed that (2) moderators were intervention time, intervention methods, age level, recruitment method, recruitment category, sample characteristics, student category, control group treatment conditions, and different languages, all of which had a significant influence on subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and depression. Moreover, indications regarding literature collection, publication bias, and cultural differences were found, and the quality of the studies varied widely. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that positive psychology interventions were effective for the enhancement of subjective well-being and psychological well-being as well as for reducing depression symptoms. Finally, according to the conclusions, suggestions for positive psychology intervention research, educational practice, and future research are proposed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2831,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Ambiguity and Inference Processing in Verbal Jokes: Analyses of Eye Movement,"Hsin-I Lu, Yu-Chen Chan and Hsueh-Chih Chen","Ambiguity jokes, Eye tracking, Humor techniques, Inference jokes, Joke categories","Humor is a high-level cognitive ability in humans. In jokes, it is the humor-generating technique and not the content of the humorous stimulus that generates amusement. Eye-tracking techniques can provide a direct and objective recording of participants’ internal representations in various cognitive and affective processes. The present study thus aimed to compare the cognitive and affective processes associated with distinct humor techniques (i.e., ambiguity and inference jokes) by using eye-tracking techniques, with both objective eye movement indices and subjective ratings. Sixty-eight participants participated in two experiments that had within-subjects designs. Experiment 1 investigated various categories of ambiguity jokes by using stimulus categories (phonological jokes, phonological nonjokes, semantic jokes, semantic nonjokes, syntactic jokes, and syntactic nonjokes) as independent variables and both objective eye movement indices (first pass gaze duration, total viewing time, average fixation counts, regression counts, and average pupil size) and subjective ratings (comprehensibility and funniness) as dependent variables. Results supported the hypothesis that first-pass gaze durations for setup lines do not differ significantly between jokes and nonjokes. Additionally, total viewing time and regression counts were shorter and lower, respectively, while reading phonologically ambiguous jokes than for syntactically ambiguous ones.Experiment 2 compared the effects of semantically inferential and semantically ambiguous jokes. The experimental design was the same as in experiment 1, except that the stimulus categories were semantically ambiguous jokes, semantically ambiguous nonjokes, bridging inferential jokes, bridging inferential nonjokes, elaborative inferential jokes, and elaborative inferential nonjokes. Results demonstrated that total viewing time was longer, regression counts were higher, and average pupil size was bigger for inferential jokes (bridging inferential jokes and elaborative inferential jokes) than for semantically ambiguous jokes. It was concluded that the cognitive processing of inferential joke takes more time and is more complicated than that of semantically ambiguous jokes, and this consequently results in deeper cognitive involvement and amusement. Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that the greatest pleasure accompanies this cognitive comprehensibility with the deeper semantic processing but that joke techniques also play a major role. Future research might use neuroimaging techniques to further investigate the neural correlates of cognitive, affective, and laughter processing of various types of joke techniques as well as design humor training courses on joke techniques.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2832,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Construction of 4-Dimensional Perfectionism and Its Relationship with Achievement Goals and Burnout,Ying-Fen Chang,"4-dimensional Perfectionism, Achievement Goals, Burnout, Perfectionistic Strivings, Self-oriented Perfectionism","Perfectionism is a highly influential personal disposition that affects students’ learning motivation, behavior, and adjustment. Most studies have classified perfectionism according to its “character” or “resources”; however, the study results have been mixed. Thus, more detailed classification of perfectionism might be necessary. Furthermore, both “character” and “resources” are useful means by which to classify perfectionism. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to construct a 4-dimensional perfectionism model by employing 2 character aspects (perfectionistic strivings/perfectionistic concerns) and 2 resource aspects (self-oriented perfectionism/socially prescribed perfectionism) and explored the relationships of the 4-dimensional perfectionism with achievement goals and burnout.Accordingly, this study performed confirmatory factor analyses of three competing models of perfectionism in order to construct the 4-dimensional perfectionism model and then constructed a model of perfectionism, achievement goals and burnout in order to analyze the relationships of perfectionism with achievement goals and burnout. The participants were 1,310 junior high school students, and structural equation modeling was used. The following results were obtained: (a) the 4-dimensional perfectionism model fitted the observed data better than the other two competing models; (b) the model of perfectionism, achievement goals, and burnout fitted the observed data well; (c) self-oriented perfectionistic strivings had the strongest effect on approach-mastery goals, and socially prescribed perfectionistic strivings had the strongest effect on approach-performance goals; (d) approach-mastery and approach-performance goals negatively predicted burnout, and avoidance-mastery and avoidance-performance goals positively predicted burnout; and (e) self-oriented perfectionistic strivings negatively predicted burnout, and self-oriented perfectionistic concerns positively predicted burnout.This study classified perfectionism through combining both its “character” and “resources” dimensions to expand past studies. The findings concerning the relationships between 4-dimensional perfectionism and 4-dimensional achievement goals yield more abundant information than past related studies. The study focused on the perspectives of approach and avoidance to analyze the relationships between 4-dimensional achievement goals and burnout to overcome the research gap. In pedagogical implications, parents and teachers can promote children’s self-oriented perfectionistic strivings and approach-mastery goals and decrease their socially prescribed perfectionistic concerns and avoidance-performance goals to lessen their burnout.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2833,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Study of the Internal Structure of the Chinese Session EvaluationQuestionnaire (C-SEQ): Client-Level Analyses,Ching-Fu Chen and Kai-Ting Chen,"Chinese Session Evaluation Questionnaire (C-SEQ), Internal structure, Session Evaluation Questionnaire Form 5 (SEQ-5), Session Effect","The Session Evaluation Questionnaire (SEQ), which is a self-rating instrument, has been widely applied in measuring the impact of counseling sessions. The SEQ may be conceived as a bridge between the counseling process and outcome. The SEQ Form 5 (the latest version of the SEQ; Stiles, Gordon, & Lani, 2002) includes 21 bipolar adjective scales in a 7-point semantic differential format. Objective: The purpose of the present study was to explore clients’ responses to the Chinese SEQ (C-SEQ), which was translated by Chen and Lin (2016). The clients’ responses to the C-SEQ were elicited and then analyzed to understand the internal structure of the C-SEQ. Methods: A total of 200 clients from 21 Taiwanese universities were recruited using heterogeneous convenience sampling by the researchers between April 2017 and July 2017. After each client attended his or her latest individual counseling session, he or she was asked to complete one copy of the C-SEQ. Thus, our collected data were drawn from the questionnaires. Results: Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted. The influences of counseling sessions, including the dimensions of session evaluation and postsession mood evaluation, were measured. The results of this study corroborated the premise that four factors are elicited from the C-SEQ, namely Depth, Smoothness, Positivity, and Arousal. Thus, the C-SEQ assesses two dimensions of session evaluation, Depth and Smoothness, as well as two dimensions of postsession mood, Positivity and Arousal. Conclusion: The internal structure of the C-SEQ encompasses four factors: Depth, Smoothness, Positivity, and Arousal. Intercorrelation coefficients between Depth, Smoothness, and Positivity were between low and medium (.27- .67, p < .01). The C-SEQ is now available as an instrument for giving feedback regarding counseling practice and counseling process research in Taiwan. Additionally, based on the findings and limitations in this research, suggestions for counseling practice and future research are offered by the researchers.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2834,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Adolescent Clients’ Perception of the Counseling Relationship: An Initial Qualitative Analysis from the Client Perspective,"Ying-Fen Wang, Ying-Chi Huang and Wan-Yi Chen","Adolescent clients, Attachment, Common factors, Counseling relationship","The purpose of the current investigation was to explore adolescent clients’ experiences in the counseling relationship,especially the emotional bond to their therapist, in the context of school counseling in Taiwan. Six adolescent clients who received counseling for at least three sessions and were currently receiving counseling were recruited to participate in this study.A qualitative method with semi-structured in-depth interview was adopted to understand participants’ experiences. The mean age was 15.5 years, and ages ranged from 13 to 18 years. Five of the participants were girls and one was a boy. Three were junior high school students, and the rest were senior high school students. Data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Findings revealed four categories of experiences regarding the counseling relationship: clients’ perception of therapists’ personal traits and emotions, clients’ perception of therapists’ attitude toward them, clients’ reaction and evaluation of the counseling relationship, and clients’ changes outside the counseling sessions. The most significant finding identified by the authors was that clients’ reaction and evaluation of the counseling relationship could be divided into the following three subcategories: clients noticed that the counseling relationship was different from their other interpersonal relationships, clients experienced a positive emotional bond when interacting with their therapists, and clients’ internal reactions and behavior changed within the counseling relationship.Findings of the current study indicated that when adolescent clients perceive that their therapists treat them with respect, equality, acceptance, and care, which differs from their other interpersonal experiences, adolescent clients develop a sense of trust and intimacy with their therapist and are willing to cooperate with the therapist on therapeutic tasks, even changing the manner in which they interact with the therapist. After receiving counseling, they reported increased self-understanding, developed a more flexible manner of emotional expression, and exhibited more adaptive interpersonal behaviors. Based on these findings, the authors propose that future research could explore changes of the nature of the relationship during the course of counseling and effects of the counseling relationship on outcomes across the stages of counseling. Additionally, it is suggested that in clinical practice, building emotional connections and providing a positive interpersonal experience should be underscored when counseling adolescent clients.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2835,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Young Children’s Social Dominance, Influencing Factors, and Resources Control Strategies",Hsiu-Lan Tsai and Yu-Ju Chou,"Children, Resource control strategy, Social dominance","This study was designed to investigate the phenomenon of young children’s social dominance. The study evaluated age and sex differences and assessed the associations between parenting, moral behavior, social dominance and the resource control strategies of young children. The study was divided into two stages. In the first stage, a total of 110 preschoolers (ages 4-6) were rated by their teachers on social dominance and moral behavior and their parents filled in the parenting behavior questionnaire. In the second stage, 30 highly dominant children were rated by their teachers on resource control strategies and observed resource control behavior in a play situation.The study determined that young children’s social dominance increased with age. A significant difference in social dominance was evident between age groups but not between sexes. Children’s social dominance was correlated with negative parenting and children’s moral behaviors. In parenting, six-year-old children’s social dominance was correlated with the deprivation of rights. Five-year-old children’s social dominance was correlated with corporal punishment parenting. Children’s moral behaviors improved along with the age increase and were highly correlated with social dominance. After controlling for the age difference, moral behaviors and social dominance were still correlated.As evident in the observation of various age groups’ resource control behaviors, the highly social dominant children exhibited stronger resource control strategies. Most of them were bistrategic controllers and prosocial controllers. The use of the prosocial control strategy increased along with age but the coercive control strategy did not. The top two prosocial control strategies the children employed were giving suggestions and offering objects, and the least used strategy was verbally misleading a partner. The top two coercive control strategies the children employed were taking objects directly and thwarting a partner, and the least used strategy was physical aggressiveness. Highly dominant children tend to use the prosocial control strategy when interacting with other highly dominant children. However, when interacting with low-dominance children, they tend to use the coercive control strategy.The study not only improved our understanding in young children’s social dominance, but also provides a reference for parents and educators.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2836,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Connecting Principled Information and Worked Examples: Effects of Content Abstractness and Solution Complexity,Hsinmei Liao,"Analogical mapping, Example complexity, Principle abstractness","Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of content abstractness (Experiment 1) and solution complexity(Experiment 2) for connecting principled information and worked examples. College students who had not learned theselected statistical distribution studied the principled information and two examples. In Experiment 1, the participantscompleted tasks for principle-example mapping and example-example mapping. Overall, their performance inprinciple-example mapping was lower than that in example-example mapping. They also committed more one-to-manyerrors and mapped fewer parallel contents and more nonparallel contents in principle-example mapping in comparison withthose in example-example mapping. However, these effects were weaker when one example in the example-example pair was relatively complex. In Experiment 2, the participants completed tasks for principle-simple example mapping and principle-complex example mapping. Their performance in principle–complex example mapping was lower than that in principle-simple example mapping. In addition, the participants made more one-to-many errors and mapped fewer parallel elements and slightly more nonparallel elements. This study adds direct evidence to the research literature concerning the process of connecting a principle to its example. Abstractness causes principle-example mapping difficulty but not example-example mapping difficulty. Because a general element in the principle may be mapped onto several possible candidates in the example, mapping of corresponding elements between the principle and example is less accurate. However, principle-example mapping provides learners an opportunity to examine elements not demonstrated in the examples, and such learning tends to be more accurate in comparison to example-example mapping. Furthermore, pairing a simple example with the principle appears to facilitate learning of the parallel content, whereas pairing a complex example with the principle tends to promote learning of the nonparallel content. The implications of these findings are discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2837,50.4,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
White Matter Network Connectome of Mathematical and Scientific Talents,"Ching-Chih Kuo, Hsueh-Chih Chen, Keng-Chen Liang, Susan Shur-Fen Gau, Ching-Lin Wu","Diffusion tensor imaging, Graph theory, Intelligence, Mathematical and scientific talents","Recent studies have highlighted that people with mathematical and scientific talents develop a different brain structure from those with typical development. However, most of these studies have focused on the relationship between cognitive functions of the brain and the operation of a single area of the brain. This study explores the connections among the network structures with relation to mathematical and scientific talents, intelligence, and white matter. The study recruited 42 men with normal nerve functions. The experimental group comprised 21 participants with mathematical and scientific talents and an age of 21.00 ± 1.67 years; the control group comprised 21 participants with typical developmental and an age of 21.48 ± 2.29 years. The mathematical and scientific talent and typical developmental groups consisted of 21 people each. The researchers adopted the third version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test to evaluate individual intelligence, conduct diffusion tensor imaging of participants, and construct a network of white matter to analyze the overall network attributes and nodal efficiencies using graph theory. The results show that the communication efficiency among the nodes inside the local region is relatively better in people with mathematical and scientific talents, particularly the in the superior prefrontal gyrus. Moreover, when intelligence was equal between the two groups, the mathematical and scientific talent group outperformed the other in terms of node efficiency in local regions and the clustering coefficient in the superior occipital gyrus. The relationship between the topological properties and the intelligence of the mathematical and scientific talent group and the typical developmental group showed that only the intelligence of the typical developmental group was positively connected with integrated efficiency across several regions of the brain; however, no direct correlation was shown in the mathematical and scientific talents group. The results not only provided empirical evidence for the disparity in white matter structure between mathematical and scientific talent and typical development groups but also distinguished mathematical and scientific talents, mathematical ability, and intelligence based on the topological network of the brain, which can be used in future assessments for people with mathematical and scientific talents.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2824,50.3,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Filial Therapy on Parents of Children with Externalizing Behaviors,"Hsiu-Chu Liu, Shu-Chen Kao and Wan-Lin Kao","Externalization problems children, Filial therapy, Parent-child relationship, Parental stress","This study investigated the effects of filial therapy on children with externalizing behaviors and mothers’ parenting stress. The results obtained using the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment show that six parent-child pairs among the members had an externalized scale t score above the marginal clinical range (t ≥ 60). Based on the study design, the members were invited to participate in a filial therapy group for 2 hours per week over the course of 10 weeks. The study was also conducted over the course of 10 weeks. The study adapted both quantitative and qualitative research methods; the quantitative method uses a single-subject design. The members were administered the pre- and pro-tests of the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment and the Parenting Stress Index, as well as the Teacher’s Report. After the test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine the results. For the qualitative method, to investigate the experiences of mothers who had children with externalizing behaviors in the filial therapy session, the members were interviewed individually to explore the experiences of mothers for 1 hour after the session was completed. This study provides the following research findings: (1) Filial therapy had significant effects in terms of not only reducing the children’s problems related to internalizing, externalizing, and overall parts but also in rapidly reducing the mothers’ parental stress continuously. (2) The qualitative data analyses showed that the effects of the filial therapy program on the mothers of children with externalizing behaviors include awareness and understanding, positive changes, finding wonderful things in life, and improving both family relationships and communication. The study results show that filial therapy had positive effects on all the members, including by reducing children’s externalizing behaviors and reducing mothers’ parental stress.

The Influence of Order of Mention and Type of Character Expression on Mandarin Chinese Readers’ Pronoun Resolution,Mei-Yao Wu and Yuh-Tsuen Tzeng,"Order of mention, Pronoun resolution, Reading comprehension, Recency effect, Type of character expression","Narrative texts often contain several characters, and these characters have different levels of importance in the text. For example, some characters play primary protagonists, whereas others play supporting or minor roles. These characters are introduced in different orders and presented through different types of character expressions, such as proper nouns, pronouns, or role descriptions. When an author uses pronouns to refer to the characters mentioned in earlier sentences, readers must figure out which characters the pronouns are referring to. Therefore, pronouns can be integrated in earlier sentences. As a result, in later sentences, referential processing becomes essential for building discourse coherence. The order of mention and the types of character expression affect readers’ pronoun resolution; and developmental data in the literature have shown that the ages of readers affect their pronoun resolution, too. The present study focused on how three factors affected pronoun resolution, namely the order of mention, the type of character expression, and the reader’s age. We recruited 24 college students and 26 sixth grade students as the study participants. A three-way mixed design (age × order of mention × type of character expression) was adopted to examine the interaction patterns of these factors. The participants were asked to read texts sentence-by-sentence at their normal speed, and the reading time was then recorded. The results showed that no three-way interaction occurred. Two-way interactions were further examined in participants from separate age groups. The adult participants were unaffected by the order of mention and type of character expression. The sixth grade students were unaffected by the type of character expression when a pronoun referred to the first-mentioned character; however, in terms of the second-mentioned character, the proper name expression of the characters enhanced pronoun resolution in readers. This implies that the name of the character is more important than the role description for readers. Moreover, the reading time patterns were observed to be similar across these four two-way conditions for both age groups. Finally, some applications of pronoun resolution instruction and practical examplaes are serve as suggestions for teachers.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2826,50.3,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effect of Dongshi Based Dance Therapy Group on Body Image in Female College Students,"Hsing-Yi Ma, Chung-Hsin Chiang and Tsung-Chin Lee","Body image, Dongshi-based dance/movement therapy, Positive body image, Prevention program","Body image is a crucial issue in the self-development of modern women. Body dissatisfaction is believed to be one of the risk factors for eating disorder development in women in adolescent and young adult age brackets. Therefore, body image promotion programs have been provided for these groups. However, these programs have primarily emphasized negative body image factors. Although the concept of positive body image has been developed to emphasize positive feelings about one’s body and body-mind attunement, a well-organized program is required to ensure this concept is put in practice. Moreover, most body image promotion programs focus on cognitive or behavioral methods of changing negative body image or body dissatisfaction, and such programs seemingly disregard strategies for directly experiencing or becoming aware of one’s body and changing one’s body image. Therefore, this study developed a body image promotion program that draws from Dongshi-based dance and movement therapy to examine its effectiveness in developing body appreciation and responsiveness and reduce negative body image. A total of 49 female students (aged 18-25 years) were recruited from a university in Taipei and were then categorized into three groups-namely, the experimental (N = 14), physical education (N = 15), and control (N = 20) groups. The experimental group attended eight weekly 1.5-hour sessions of the proposed program. Data for all three groups were collected using a self-reported questionnaire with three data collection points, namely, before participation, after participation, and during a 3-month follow-up. The results showed a significant effect on body awareness and physical appearance comparison behavior in the post-test and 3-month follow-up for the experimental group compared with the physical education and control groups. In conclusion, this study developed a Dongshi-based dance and movement therapy program to promote positive body image for female college students, with the initial results indicating an improvement in body awareness and appearance comparison behavior among the participants.

Validating the Standard Setting on Multimedia-based Assessment of Scientific Inquiry Abilities,Hsiao-Hui Lin and Hsin-Kai Wu,"Bookmark, Scientific inquiry abilities, Standard setting, Validation","This study developed a standard setting for Grade 11 of the Multimedia-based Assessment of Scientific Inquiry Abilities (MASIA) based on three levels of standard performance descriptions: below basic, basic, and proficient. The study also used a bookmark to identify the cut-off scores. Furthermore, the study discussed the correct degree of the MASIA standard, which depends on multiple levels of evidence, namely procedural, internal, and external evidence for validity. First, the result of the procedural evaluation for validity showed that the standard setting of scientific inquiry abilities adopted in this study is supported by the procedural evidence for validity. Second, the result of the internal evaluation for validity showed that the standard error of each performance level that participants reached in rounds one and two were within an acceptable range (standard error [SE] < 0.12), thus indicating good intra-rater consistency. The consistency within the standard-setting method was evaluated using the standard error of the sample mean based on the median of the cut-off scores from round two. The result showed that the standard error of every performance level was within an acceptable range (SE < 0.12), thus denoting high consistency within the results of the standard-setting method. Third, the inter-rater consistency of the standard setting was examined using an independent sample t test, and the results showed that none the cut-off scores set by the participants of different groups reached statistical significance. Therefore, the standard setting of scientific inquiry abilities can be supported by internal evidence for procedural validity. Finally, this study treated the quasi-setting results derived from the cluster analysis as convergent validity-based evidence to assess external validity. The results showed that the correlation coefficient of the three performance levels of the students differentiated by two standard-setting methods reached statistical significance, thus indicating that those who judged the performance levels of the students had a certain degree of consistency. Moreover, a discriminant analysis was conducted to determine the consistency of the standard settings, and the results revealed that the consistency of the factors classified into “observing and questioning,” “planning and experimenting,” “analyzing and concluding,” and “reasoning and arguing” were in the following sequence: 79.50%, 86.00%, 100.00%, and 89.90%. In the present study, the cut-off scores obtained by the bookmark presented high discrimination for each performance level category and can be supported using external evidence for validity. These results suggest that the bookmark standard setting of scientific inquiry abilities are appropriate and effective.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2828,50.3,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Validation of a Strengths Scale for Adolescents in Taiwan,"Yu-Chen Wang, Yi-Mei Lee and Ching-Lin Wu","Adolescent, Scale development, Strengths","The study was developed in three stages to establish a strengths scale for adolescents in Taiwan. In the first stage, the participants were 438 junior high students and 73 junior high teachers and data related to the strengths of junior high students were collected; we created questions about the scale based on the results. In the second stage, after expert validation was conducted, we conducted a pretest on 170 junior high students and established a formal scale. In the third stage, we verified the reliability and validity of the scale. The participants were 431 junior high students, (218 boys (50.6%) and 213 girls (49.4%) between the ages of 12 and 16 years (M = 14.31, SD = 0.85). The strengths scale for adolescents in Taiwan contained 47 items and nine constructs, namely introspection and responsibility; creativity and curiosity; dream and ambition; activeness and humor; altruism and cooperativeness; happiness and gratitude; friendliness and amiability; reframing and relief; and optimism and hope. High scores indicate a high degree of strengths in a specific construct. The Cronbach’s α of each subscale was between .80 and .93, and the factor loadings of each subscale were between .486 and .952. The correlativity of each factor was between .39 and .70. The result of a confirmatory factor analysis showed a good fit; the component reliability was between .61 and .91. The average variance extracted of the subscale, optimism and hope, was .35, and that of the other subscales was between .47 and .71. The correlation between each latent factor ranged from .42 to .82. Overall, the results indicated good construct validity and criterion validity. The study reported that among the nine subscales, creativity and curiosity scored the highest, whereas activeness and humor scored the lowest. Gender differences were only noted in altruism and cooperativeness. Finally, the results and suggestions for application and future studies were discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2829,50.3,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"A Passion for English Learning? Comparing the English Learning Motivations and Self-Perceived English Proficiency between Two Types of College Students in Taipei, Taiwan",Yann-Ru Ho,"College students, English learning motivation, Self-perceived English proficiency","This study investigated the English learning motivations and self-perceived English proficiency between two types of college students in Taipei. Students from public, private, comprehensive, and vocational colleges were selected and 720 effective samples were obtained. Factor analysis, t-test, MANOVA, and multiple regression were used to conduct the data analysis. A scale with 15 items of English learning motivations was designed and 12 items were retained after an item analysis and exploratory factor analysis. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, three factors-intrinsic motivation, instrumental motivation, and passivity towards requirements motivation-were extracted. This scale had high internal consistency reliability (α = .850 - .913), test-retest reliability (r = .88 - .93), and good construct validity. The research findings are as follows: First, intrinsic motivation had the highest intensity, whereas passivity towards requirements motivation had the lowest intensity. This result differed from those of many studies that found that East Asian students had low intrinsic motivation. Second, among the three motivations, intrinsic motivation differed significantly based on sex (female students > male students) and between the type of college (comprehensive college students > vocational college students). For instrumental motivation, comprehensive college students had significantly higher motivation than vocational college students did. Third, students’ self-perceived English proficiency was not high (1.64 on a 3-point scale). The female students’ mean score was significantly higher than that of male students. Moreover, college students’ comprehensive mean score was significantly higher than that of vocational college students. Furthermore, the results also revealed the strong predictive power (31.9%) of background variables (gender and college type) and three types of motivations on students’ self-perceived English proficiency. Finally, this study offered suggestions for increasing students’ English learning motivation.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2830,50.3,2019,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Investigating Sources of Differential Item Functioning: the Relationship Between Item Property and Differential Item Functioning,"Guo-Wei Sun, Cheng-Te Chen and Ching-Lin Shih","DIF source, Differential item functioning, Differential facet functioning, Linear logistic test model, Random effects linear logistic test model","Because assessment methods for differential item functioning (DIF) have been developed and thoroughly investigated, the focus in DIF research has shifted to explaining DIF phenomena. Experts in this field are recruited to tap possible sources of DIF. Quantitative analysis results help experts reviewing DIF to locate sources for DIF items. This study aimed to demonstrate the use of the differential facet functioning (DFF) procedure implemented using the linear logistic test model (LLTM) and random effects linear logistic test model (LLTM-R) to explain possible DIF sources. The efficiency of LLTM and LLTM-R in detecting DFF under various conditions was also evaluated. The simulation results indicated that the DIF effect was significantly influenced by the DFF effect of item properties. Moreover, as the design matrices had a high density (e.g., 60%), Type-I error rates of DIF assessment were seriously inflated. We also demonstrated the procedure of DFF analysis with an empirical data. The result showed that most DIF items were related to two item properties, which would be provided as possible DIF sources in the item-review meeting. Researchers should implement DFF assessment using LLTM-R to help explain DIF sources.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2815,50.2,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Instrument development and validation of implicit and explicit measures of gender stereotypes in the division of housework,Yu-Ling Lan and Hung-Yu Lin,"Domestic labor, Gender stereotype, Iimplicit measure","The purpose of this study was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of two new instruments-the Domestic Gender Role Scale (DGRS) and the Domestic Gender Role Implicit Association Test (DGR IAT)-in assessing Taiwanese people’s explicit and implicit gender stereotypes regarding domestic labor. In a pilot study, 92 Taiwanese adults were recruited to obtain a sample of genderized household chores for development of the initial DGRS and DGR IAT versions. In the main study, another 149 Taiwanese people were recruited on a voluntary basis to examine the psychometric properties of the DGRS and DGR IAT. Confirmatory factor analysis of this sample indicated that the DGRS was a three-factor model. Except for the DGRS subscale for male baby boomers, the Cronbach’s alpha values and composite reliability coefficients of the three DGRS subscale scores were all above .7, indicating satisfactory reliability. The significant IAT effects of the DGR IAT indicated that it was a valid instrument for assessing implicit gender stereotypes regarding domestic labor. Its reliability coefficient was over .7 only when assessing Taiwanese baby boomers using the congruent association-first version of the DGR IAT. Moreover, the weak association between its IAT effects and the three DGRS subscale scores revealed the divergent validity of these two instruments, whereas the moderate correlation among the three DGRS subscale scores indicated its convergent validity. As newly developed instruments, the DGRS demonstrated suitable reliability and validity, whereas the DGR IAT had suitable validity but required further modifications to improve its reliability. This study provided only an initial validation of these two instruments, and further research should validate their psychometric properties using samples with diverse education levels and marital statuses.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2816,50.2,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploring the insight problem-solving rules and evaluating the effectiveness of teaching the problem-solving rules,"Fa-Chung Chiu, Chih-Chun Hsu, Yu-Lin Chang, Yao-Nan Lin and Hsueh-Chih Chen","Divergent thinking, Lexical ambiguity, Insight problem","Insight problem-solving training is a core topic in creativity education and creative thinking. However, few studies on enhancing such skills have identified the norms of insight problem-solving. According to the literature, a commonality exists between insight problems and jokes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate insight problem-solving rules and examine their effects on improving problem-solving skills and divergent thinking through analyzing the problem-solving characteristics and structures of jokes. In the first study phase, 101 participants were randomly assigned to either the insight problem-solving training group or the control group. The experimental group received training for “homonyms,” “exceptions to the rules for punch lines,” and “alternatives for punch lines,” and completed tests on insight problem-solving skills and divergent thinking. The results indicated that the experimental group had significantly better performance in “homonyms,” “alternatives for punch lines,” and overall insight problem-solving than the control group. In the second study phase, differences in the effects of three types of insight problem-solving training were examined. A total of 200 college students were recruited and randomly assigned to four groups: “homonyms,” “exceptions to the rules for punch lines,” “alternatives for punch lines,” and “no training” (i.e., the control group). The results indicated that the “homonyms” group performed significantly better for “homonyms” and overall insight problem-solving than the other groups. However, training for “exceptions to the rules for punch lines” and “alternatives for punch lines” exhibited no significant effects insight problem-solving and provided preliminary findings for the effects of training of “homonyms” derived from the structure of jokes.

Development and analysis of a checking assessment for word problem solving in primary school learners,Chia-Hua Hsu,"Checking, Learning assessment, Single-step word problem, Word problem-solving","This study developed a Checking Assessment for Single-Step Word Problem-Solving for Addition and Subtraction (CA-SSWPS-AS) using componential and content analyses. The checking ability component was divided into two dimensions: reflection and error detection. The reflection dimension consisted of checking actions and checking skills, whereas error detection comprised errors in answer calculation, operational procedure, problem semantic context, and quantitative information catching, as well as a correct (no error) facet. The single-step word problems for addition and subtraction were derived from various mathematics textbooks for first and second graders in Taiwanese elementary schools. Componential and content analyses were used to examine the checking operations and semantic schema involved in single-step word problem-solving for addition and subtraction. The results were then used in development of the CA-SSWPS-AS. Considering the homogeneity of learning contents and experiences in different schools, 864 second graders from Chiayi City and Chiayi County in Taiwan were selected as participants through convenience and cluster sampling. All participants were tested using the CA-SSWPS-AS combined with experience preactivated tasks in single-step word problem-solving for addition and subtraction. The data were divided into two clusters for use in random cross-validation statistical analyses. Validity analysis using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis produced a number of factor structures that matched the aforementioned two dimensions and their facets. The variance proportions of factor extraction and model fitness were positive, as was criteria-related validity (using students’ scores assessed by teachers in classroom performance-checking as criteria). Reliability analysis demonstrated a positive α coefficient and composite reliability. Regarding item analysis, the critical ratio was strong, regardless of whether a single item, a subassessment, or the whole was analyzed. Finally, reflection and error detection performance varied significantly when checking individuals with different word problem-solving performances.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2818,50.2,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Relationship between session impact, working alliance, and counseling satisfaction on preoccupied clients with attachment style in the initial counseling stage",Ching-Fu Chen and Ya-Hsuan Wang,"Counseling satisfaction, PLS-SEM, Preoccupied with attachment style, Session impact, Working alliance","The purpose of this study was to investigate relationships between clients’ perception of session impact, working alliance, and counseling satisfaction in the initial counseling stage. All of the clients in this study had a preoccupied attachment style. The data were collected through questionnaires, namely, the Session Evaluation Questionnaire Form 5 (SEQ-5) (Stiles, Gordon, & Lani, 2002), Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) (Horvath & Greenberg, 1989), and Counseling Satisfaction Inventory-Short Form (CSI-S) (Chen & Jian, 2011). A total of 87 clients from 13 Taiwanese universities were recruited through heterogeneous convenience sampling between October 2014 and July 2016. After their third individual counseling session, clients completed the SEQ-5, WAI, and CSI-S. In addition, partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypothesized path model. The results of this study were as follows: 1) clients’ session impact predicted working alliance (effect size: .84, p < .001); 2) clients’ working alliance predicted counseling satisfaction (effect size: .56, p < .001); 3) clients’ session impact predicted working alliance (effect size: .84, p < .001); 4) clients’ working alliance predicted counseling satisfaction (effect size: .56, p < .001); 5) clients’ session impact indirectly predicted counseling satisfaction through working alliance (effect size: .47, p < .05); and 6) clients’ session impact directly predicted counseling satisfaction (effect size: .31; p < .01).

The nature of Yuan and its influence on career development,Di-Chen Li and Shuh-Ren Jin,"Career Development, Narrative Research, Yuan","The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of Yuan, the role of Yuan and its influence on career development. Yuan（緣）refers to a potential relationships between people and people, people and things, people and universe as well. Comparable to the thought of karma in Buddhism, it can be interpreted as destiny, coincidence as conditioned by one’s past in the Chinese folk religion. According to purposive sampling method, six participants were invited to tell their Yuan-related stories. Their stories were then analyzed using a category-content analysis in narrative research method. The results were as follows. 1. There are eleven characteristics of Yuan and they can be classified into three main categories, which can be entitled as “Yuan as changing”, “Yuan as connecting” and “Yuan as matching”. “Yuan as changing” indicates two characteristics of Yuan. First, Yuan as uncertainty, it cannot be controlled or predicted; Second, Yuan is very complex in its’ nature, it always has a personal meaning for the research participant. “Yuan as connecting” indicates six characteristics of Yuan. First, Yuan can make sense of the causal relationship between seemingly unrelated things in the participant’s career path. Second, Yuan happens again and again, which helps the participant to adjust accordingly to the new environment and to stabilize their career development. Third, Yuan can guide participants via different events to become themselves. Fourth, Yuan can directly or indirectly promote the participant’s career development. Fifth, Yuan can enlighten participants. Sixth, Yuan happens at the right time and always has a significant influence on the participant. “Yuan as matching” indicates three characteristics of Yuan. First, Yuan presences by our side unexpectedly with those who has close relationship with us previously. Second, Yuan matches us with people in terms of inexplicable attraction and it has a unique inspiration to the individual. Third, people must first try their best in career, and allow Yuan to do the rest. 2. There has six functions of Yuan in the process of career development. First, it can help us fulfill ourselves as a whole; Second, it can offer opportunities when people are struggling with career frustration; Third, it can stabilize career development by offering a positive emotional experience in working practice; Fourth, it can play a reflexivity role when career adversity is encountered; Fifth, it allows people to be themselves by connecting people and thing in diverse career positions; and sixth, it can integrate experience by enabling adaptation to career change. 3. The Yuan has two main influences on career development, namely, on practical work and on personal growth.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2822,50.2,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Physical activity and the aging brain: A review of functional magnetic resonance imaging studies,"Feng-Tzu Chen, Chih-Mao Huang, Chun-Chih Wang and Yu-Kai Chang","Cognitive aging, Executive function, Magnetic reasoning imaging, Physical activity","In this article, we review recent findings of the effects of physical activities on the aging brain and cognitive functions, focusing on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (TB-fMRI). Moreover, the present articles explored both cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies that examined the brain function alterations induced by physical activity training, which included cardiovascular fitness/aerobic exercise training, Tai Chi training, resistance exercise/weight training, and coordination exercise training, using measured amounts of physical activity as assessment criteria, and taking into account cognitive-related physical activity responses. Results of these RS-fMRI studies showed that older adults that engaged in cardiovascular fitness and aerobic training showed evidence of increasing brain functions. Furthermore, these positive effects also extended to older adults engaging in Tai Chi training. Also, a few studies focused on resistance exercise training; however, the results of these investigations remain inconsistence and thus will require further confirmation in the future. Results of the TB-fMRI studies indicated that older adults with higher levels of cardiovascular fitness or those engaged in cardiovascular fitness training combined with coordination training, have gained beneficial effects regarding brain functions. Specifically, the positive effects of cardiovascular fitness could be found in both normal and pathological aging populations, including older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Older adults with higher amounts of physical activity benefited in their brain functions more than older cognitively intact adults, or those with a high risk for dementia. Collectively, the results of previous studies established an experimental basis for assessing positive relationships between physical activities and brain functions, revealing that physical activity approaches might induce different improved brain functions. The consequence of these reviews provides physical activity prescriptions and exercise models relevant to improving brain functions for older populations in the society of Taiwan.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=2823,50.2,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Effectiveness of Group Counseling Sessions Aimed at Alleviating Examination Stress among Junior High School Students,"Tzu-Yang Chao, Yao-Ting Sung, Hui-Ning Kuo and Ying-Ying Chang","Adolescents, Examination stress, Examination Stress Scale, Group counseling session, Mixed method","For adolescents, examination stress is a widespread and universal phenomenon, and how to alleviate Examination Stress is also an important issue. The purpose of this present study is two-fold: based on the Examination Stress Framework, to set up group counseling sessions to help junior high school students alleviate examination stress, and to inspect whether the group counseling sessions are effective for ninth-grade students who experiencing high levels of examination stress. The parallel mixed method research design was used in this present study, by conducting both quantitative and qualitative methods. In regard to the quantitative method, we used the single-group-pretest-posttest design. The Examination Stress Scale (ExamSS) was used to measure the level of examination stress of ninth graders at a public junior high school in Taipei. According to the results, we then recruited 25 students experiencing high examination stress, and divided these students into four counseling groups. Each group underwent six counseling group sessions, after which the ExamSS was re-administered in order to determine whether there had been any decline in levels of examination stress. In regard to the qualitative method, in the other hand, we also interviewed six students after the counseling group sessions, to conduct qualitative content analysis to explore the possible benefits of the group counseling sessions. The quantitative result indicates that there is a significant reduction in levels of examination stress after the six counseling sessions. The qualitative result also indicates that benefits of group counseling sessions may be classified into “mitigation of physiological anxiety”, “emotional release”, “change of perspective”, and “learning how to deal with stress and other problems”. On the basis of these results, the present study provides theory- and practice-based recommendations about the group counseling sessions for examination stress, hoping that educational policy can be used to provide counselling programs in schools where it is needed so as to effectively reduce examination stress among adolescents.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1817,50.1,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

A newly developed three-step specification latent transition analysis of Mplus7.3 was used for data analysis. The research variables were measures of self-esteem, scores on the dissatisfaction scale, depressive symptoms, and delinquent behaviors. A total of 2,685 junior high school students participated in the study, and self-report questionnaires were administered for three consecutive years. Latent profile analysis results revealed that the self-esteem of adolescents could be classified into four heterogeneous classes: low, middle, high, and contradictory classes. Latent transition analysis results also indicated that during the 3 years of the study, the transition of students from one class to another was more likely to be upward than downward. Furthermore, the ratio of movers from the seventh grade to the eighth grade was lower than that of movers from the eighth grade to the ninth grade. Auxiliary variables such as academic performance, peer relationship, closeness with homeroom teacher, and mother-child relationship exhibited a significant correlation with membership of the four self-esteem classes.

However, the path between gratitude and mental health is still unclear and needs to be further examined. Purpose: The present study wanted to emphasize that gratitude can beneficially affect people’s positive and negative mental status simultaneously. And it would like to know if resilience, as a potential mediator that has the same characteristic as gratitude, could fully explain the relationship between gratitude and mental health. Method: This study adopted both “well-being” and “perceived stress” which represented positive and negative indicators of mental health to investigate multiple routes among gratitude, resilience, and mental health. Survey data were collected from 209 staff of six Chinese independent high schools in Malaysia. It measured participants’ gratitude, resilience, well-being, and perceived stress by using relevant survey tools. Results and Conclusion: The results from structural equation modeling analyses suggested that: 1) resilience could significantly mediate the relationship between gratitude and well-being; 2) resilience could significantly and highly mediate the relationship between gratitude and perceived stress; 3) gratitude could go through resilience and perceived stress to increase subjective well-being.

Study on Attitude toward Mobile Devices in Students with Visual Impairments: Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use as Mediating Variables,"Hsing-Ning Lee, Yung-Fu Cheng, Chien-Huey Sophie Chang and Jung-Gen Wu","Mobile device, Perceived usefulness, Perceived ease of use, Students with visual impairments","The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of various factors on the attitude toward mobile device of students with visual impairments (VI) in Taiwan. This study also explored the mediating effect of perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) and verified the structural model of social support, resource possession, and abilities and attitudes regarding the use of mobile devices. We redesigned the attitude scale in accordance with the suggestions of other studies to comprise three sections: cognition, affect, and conation. We investigated 144 students with VI above junior high school who had ever used mobile devices. Reliability and validity were examined using item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. The results revealed that social support had a positive effect on PU and PEOU and an indirect effect on attitude toward mobile devices, mediated by PU and PEOU. Possession of resources and knowledge had a positive effect on PEOU and an indirect effect on PEOU, mediated by abilities for mobile device use, and consequently exhibited a relationship with attitude. PEOU had a positive effect on cognition, affect, and conation. Nevertheless, PU exhibited a significant relationship only with cognition and conation. Therefore, the findings of this study provide some suggestions for improving the attitude of VI students toward mobile devices. First, the researchers suggest the perceived ease of use (PEOU) be considered primarily when developing mobile devices, digital tools or applications, in order to accommodate the needs of users with visual impairments and to motivate their acceptance of those digital equipments. Secondly, family members, teachers, relatives and friends can provide more social support to encourage frequent use of digital mobile devices in people with visual impairments. Finally, the researchers will strongly recommend the government to provide sufficient mobile devices with related trainings for applying these devices, which will definitely help promote their attitude toward mobile devices.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1820,50.1,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Forum Theater: Innovation for Enhancing Medical Ethics Teaching,Gin-Hong Lee and Hou-Chang Chiu,"Forum theatre, Medical education, Medical ethics, Role play","Background: Student role-play is a commonly utilized practice in medical ethics education. Because of various limitations, the benefits of role-play have not been fully realized. An interactive forum theater exhibits a unique design that may compensate for the drawbacks of role-play and provide opportunities to achieve the goals of ethics education. This study explored the application of participatory forum theater in a bioethics course and evaluated its effectiveness from different perspectives. Methods: Forty-seven second-year medical students who had taken a compulsory bioethics course participated in this study. Four bioethics clinical vignettes were predesigned by the research team. The forum theater program was conducted by four drama experts and the course instructors; this program had a total duration of 8 weeks, with 2 weeks (4 hours) for each vignette. The quantitative measurements were the interpersonal reactivity index, an ethics knowledge questionnaire, and a final-term evaluation. The qualitative data were collected through in-class observation, after-class review meetings, and student reflection reports. Research data were collected at the beginning, middle, and end of this program. Results: Compared with the initial measurements, a significant increase was observed in student feelings of satisfaction and perceived benefits with regard to this program as well as ethical knowledge at the end of the course.

The Impact of Service-learning Attitudes on Caring Minority Groups for College Students: The Moderating Effect of Online Social Caring Connections,"I-Hsiung Chang, Hsiang-Ying Shen and Ru-Si Chen","Caring minority groups, College students, Moderating effect, Online social caring connections, Service-learning attitudes","This study focused on the college students’ attitude toward service learning on the perceptions about minority caring and helping intentions, and explored the moderating effects of social caring minority groups on this relationship. This study examined the influencing factors and moderating effect of college students’ attitudes toward service-learning and caring minority groups by survey. The questionnaire consisted of three factors, including service-learning attitudes, caring minority groups, and online social caring connections. The researchers employed partial least squares to analyze the sample data, and testing interaction effect and statistical significance with the moderating factor. The results indicated college students’ perceptions about the online social caring interactions and community connections moderated their attitudes toward the relationship of service-learning practices and caring or improving the social situations of minority groups. The college students with the lower scores of online social caring connections had the positive preferences about practical objectives and instructions of service-learning activities, and helped their considerations about the unfair and unequal situations for minority groups to improve their disadvantaged status.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1822,50.1,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Developmental study of Elementary School Children’s Pronominal and Causal Inference Abilities during Reading: Cross-sectional and Ind,,"Causality inference, Developmental pattern, Referential pronoun inference","Referential and causal inferences are key abilities for the development of reading comprehension. It is hence important to delineate children’s developmental patterns of these abilities to serve as indexes for predicting future reading comprehension achievement and providing diagnostic sources of comprehension difficulties. This study aims at examining the development and interactions of different forms of pronoun and causality during reading short texts for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grade students, and further comparing differences between good and poor comprehenders. The numbers of participants for each grade were 174, 249, and 219 respectively. Thirty-six short texts were constructed with each contained two sentences. The first sentence always mentioned two characters and the second sentence related to the first one by varying pronominal (zero versus overt pronoun) and causal relations (high versus low causality). An interrogative question appeared at the end of each text to probe readers’ comprehension. Participants sit in front of a personal computer and read the texts in a self-paced manner by pressing designated keys. This study was a 3x2x2 mixed design with grade as a between-subject factor (2nd, 3rd, & 4th grade) and pronoun forms (zero versus overt pronoun) and causality (high versus low causality) as within-subject factors. The main dependent variable was the reading time of second/inference sentences. The results indicate that three-way interaction is not significant. Two-way interactions among three factors are all significant. Overall, the developmental pattern shows that, older the readers, shorter the reading time for inference sentences. All grades show a similar pattern for processing inference sentences. The effect of causality is always significant with shorter reading time for high than low causality text for both zero and overt pronoun conditions. Further analysis reveals that, for high causal relation texts, inference sentence reading time for zero pronoun condition is significantly shorter than that of overt pronoun condition. However, for low causal relation texts, there is no inference sentence reading time difference between zero pronoun and overt pronoun conditions among students across all grades. After selecting poor versus good comprehenders from 3rd and 4th grade, we further analyze their differences in reading inference sentences. Third grade good comprehenders process inference sentences faster than poor comprehenders but there is no reading time difference between good versus poor comprehenders for the 4th grade students. To conclude, both good and poor comprehenders take less time in reading the high than the low causality texts, and less time for zero pronoun than overt pronoun texts. This study has demonstrated that the high causal relation texts for zero pronoun conditions will improve children´s resolution process, whether they have good or poor understanding of the text.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1806,49.4,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The inference processes of summarization,"Chi-Shun Lien, Yuh-tsuen Tzeng","Generalization inference, Inference, Macrostructure, Summarization","The ability of summarization is an important indicator of textbase understanding. Readers who are able to write an ideal summary of text can build up the macrostructure of text and extract the literal meaning from the text (Kintsch, 1998). A lot of local and global inferences were needed for macrostructure. Readers employ the three macro-rules during reading: First, readers delete both redundant and trivial information from the text. In order to do so, readers read text elements sequentially and decide the importance for each element on inclusion or deletion by their background knowledge. After deletion procedure, readers generalize related or similar concepts/sentences and construct superoridinate terms as substitutes. In this paper, two studies were presented to show how these inferences affected the construction of summary. In the first study, the purpose was to investigate the development of there types of inferences during summarization (i.e., deletion, generalization and construction). Fifty-three fourth graders, 55 fifth graders and 56 sixth graders were recruited from an elementary school in Chia-Yi City. Three versions of experimental texts, which were created to examine deletion, generalization, and construction inference-making abilities respectively, were given to participants for writing 60-words summaries. There was a significant developmental difference between fourth and sixth graders on the performance of generalization. Then, we selected low-ability participants from the 6th grade level and matched their word-recognition and reading-comprehension scores with participants on 4th grade. The result showed that there was a reliable difference between the low-ability group and the comprehension-match group. In the second study, the purpose was to examine how generalization inference affected children’s summarization. Sixty-five fourth graders and 53 sixth graders were recruited from an elementary school in Yunlin County. All participants were administered the Reading Comprehension growth Test, the generalization test, and the expository summarization assessment. The results showed that there was significant developmental difference on the performance of generalization inference. In addition, the generalization inference reliably predicted the performance of summarization for the fourth graders.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1807,49.4,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Development of Progress Monitoring Test of Reading Comprehension,"Yi-Fen Su, Li-Yu Hung, Po-Hsi Chen, Hsin-Yi Chen","Ability value, Elementary school students, Equivalent test, Growth curve, Reading comprehension","The purpose of this study was to develop a set of equivalent tests for reading comprehension progress monitoring for grades four to six. The reading comprehension equivalent tests can also be used as tools for evaluating instructional effects of remedial intervention. In this test, there were six alternate-forms for each grade. Four testlets were included in each alternate-form. Each testlet had one passage and ten test items. The four passages in one alternate-form included one short narrative, one short expository, one long narrative, and one long expository texts. There were 200-300 characters in short passages, and 400-500 characters in long passages. The test items were designed to measure lexical access, literal comprehension, summarization, and inferential comprehension. There were forty items in total in one alternate-form. Regarding reliability, the Cronbach´s α coefficients and split-half coefficients of all alternate-forms were mostly above .80. Using “Reading Comprehension Screening Test for Elementary School Students-Version A” as criterion, the criterion validity coefficient were .67 (p < .001), .59 (p < .001), .75 (p < .001) for grades 4, 5, and 6 respectively. In addition, based on the data collected from six time-points in 2011 school year, the growth model analysis revealed that the reading comprehension abilities of the fourth, fifth, and sixth graders increased from the beginning to the end in one school year. In order for teachers to monitor students’ progress, this test provided not only the norm of percentile rank, but also the norm of ability value (theta score). Using the ability values between two time-points, a growth coefficient could be calculated.

Psycholinguistic Properties of Chinese Characters in Primary School Corpora of Taiwan,"Meng-Feng Li, Yi-Fen Su","Phonetic consistency, Phonetic regularity, Semantic transparency, Visual complexity","This study aims at analyzing the properties of the listed vocabularies which are included in three versions of current mandarin textbooks, Nan-Yi, Kang-Syuan and Han-Lin, for students in grade one to grade six. The psycholinguistic characteristics of vocabularies, including types of characters, spatial structure, visual complexity, phonetic regularity, phonetic consistency, semantic transparency, independent and bound components, as well as phonetic and semantic radical families, are carefully analyzed. In general, the elementary level mandarin textbooks validated by the Taiwanese Ministry of Education may display differences between the simplified and traditional characters, when compared to those used in China or Hong Kong. This study established a psycholinguistic property database of Chinese character for mandarin corpora used in Taiwanese elementary schools. This database can be a reference for both the mandarin textbook publishers and the instructors for developing remedial instruction materials. It is also a useful resource for future researchers to select experimental materials. To give examples, we suggested to investigate whether the Chinese character within the word will automatically activate the network of neighborhood words sharing the character, and took a further investigation about whether the neighborhood words will affect the identification of the target Chinese characters, and whether the process of characters within the word has been involved in Chinese word recognition.

Children’s Problems With Inference Making: Causes and Consequences＊,"Jane Oakhill, Kate Cain","Comprehension difficulties, Inference abilities, Vocabulary depth","Understanding a text requires not only understanding the individual words and sentences, but also requires the construction of an integrated model of the text as a whole: a Mental Model (Johnson-Laird, 1983) or Situation Model (Kintsch, 1998). In the first part of this paper, we differentiate between the types of inference that occur as a reader understands a text: necessary inferences (at both the local and global level) and ‘merely elaborative’ inferences, which might embellish the reader’s understanding, but which are not essential to it. We then go on to discuss the problems of children who have a Specific Comprehension Difficulty (i.e. they are able to read words at an age-appropriate level but, nevertheless, have a poor understanding of the text overall). We describe the particular difficulties that such children have in answering inferential questions about a text, and outline the evidence that such difficulties are causally related to comprehension skill. We then discuss the reciprocal relation between vocabulary skills and inference making. Inference skills have a clear role in helping readers to derive the meanings of unknown words from text through the use of contextual cues and, conversely, deep vocabulary knowledge (what is known about words), and rapid access to that knowledge, can support inference making.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1813,49.4,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Knowledge-Based Inference Making for Reading Comprehension: What to Teach and What Not*,Carsten Elbro,"Graphic organizer, Inference instruction, Knowledge-based inference","It is easy to see that texts do not tell the whole story. Rather, they can be seen as detailed instructions to readers about which background knowledge they should activate and combine into a coherent mental model. There fore, readers will have to add knowledge and link information from the text with relevant background knowledge. In many cases, the text does not exhibit any explicit signal that something is missing, and the reader has to make an inference to maintain the global coherence of the text. It has been shown that students with poor comprehension sometimes fail to make such knowledge-demanding inferences because they fail to activate the relevant knowledge. In a first study, 11-year-old students were taught to activate relevant background knowledge by means of graphic organisers: some boxes had to be filled with information from the text, while others were to be filled with information from the reader’s background knowledge. The teaching turned out to be highly effective not only for inference making in reading, but also for reading comprehension in general. Two limitations are discussed. First, teaching to activate background knowledge is probably much more important for comprehension of expository texts than for typical narrative texts. This is so because comprehension of expository texts depends much more on background knowledge that is abstract, not first hand experience and thus not immediately available. Second, an over-reliance on background knowledge may stand in the way for learning something new that is in conflict with prior knowledge or beliefs. The paper ends with a call for replication studies. It is further suggested that the teaching of knowledge activation for inference making may be integrated into the teaching of common text structures such as cause-consequence, compare-contrast, and problem-solution.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1814,49.4,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Longitudinal correlational research of happiness and academic competence among Taiwanese high school students,"Chong-shiann, Hsu","Academic competence, Cross-lagged correlations, Happiness, Taiwan Education Panel Survey, Latent growth modeling","This research presented latent growth models of general happiness and school happiness among Taiwanese high school students. The relationships of these two types of happiness and academic competence were also examined. Seven hypotheses were made based on the economic and psychological explanations of happiness, the academic emotion theory, the broad-and-build theory, and the theory of eudaimonic well-being. The data from the Taiwan Educational Panel Survey were analyzed, and latent growth modeling and cross-lagged correlation were conducted. First, it was found that high school students showed decreasing general happiness and school happiness as grade level increased. However, there were slower declines for those with higher initial levels of general happiness. Second, the cross-lagged correlations showed that general happiness and school happiness significantly predicted each other. These findings implied that the economic explanation would better explain the origin of happiness than the psychological explanation. Third, the relationship between general happiness and academic competence was not significant. Fourth, the higher the initial level of school happiness, the slower the academic competence grew. The growth slope of academic competence was correlated positively with the growth slope of school happiness. But the growth slope of school happiness was negatire. Students with faster growth of academic competence would experience faster decline of school happiness. It implied that academic competency might grow at the cost of decreasing school happiness. These findings did not support the prediction from the academic emotion theory, broad-and-build theory, or theory of eudaimonic well-being. However, the theories of academic emotion and eudaimonic well-being were supported by results from the cross-lagged correlations. It showed that school happiness in Grade 7 positively predicted academic competency in Grade 9, which in turn predicted school happiness in Grade 11. It suggested that in the same educational stage, school happiness affected academic competence; while transitioning between two educational stages, academic competency affected the following school happiness.

The study designed a structured interview guide for adolescents’ sense of purpose and conducted a 40-mintute interview with each participant. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze verbatim transcription of interview data and induced four contents and relevant experiences of their sense of purpose. The contents of sense of purpose were ambitions for future, life focuses, an ideal life, and an ideal society. The relevant experience was related to contents, reasons, the timing to establish the sense of purpose, engaging and involving, and support from interpersonal sources. We calculated the frequencies of relevant categories and explored the variances between these categories. The results showed that 50% of participants had developed concrete ambitions. Ambitions for future were selected based on participants’ interest and personality characteristics or specialties, external expectations, suggestions or conditions, altruism, and life meaning. Life focuses were related to furthering academic pursuits, parents and family, classmates and friend, interests, and recreations. An ideal life was related to an ideal career, a decent life, a safe and ordinary life, and having a family to live with their parents. An ideal society was perceived as a positive and harmonious society including environmental and ecological conservation, educational and cultural development, and multidimensional justice. There was a significant difference between the age and the time to establish a sense of purpose as well as actions taken.

The Deterioration Process Resulting from the Loss of Role Understanding to the Emergence of Hostility: Intimate Partner Homicide Caused by Accusations of Infidelity,Hsien-Huei Chiou,"Chinese Relationalism, Cultural Consideration, Infidelity, Intimate Partner Homicide","Accusing one’s partner of infidelity is one of the major causes stated by offenders when intimate partner homicide occurs. Much research has been undertaken concerning this issue among western research literature, but most of them lacked cultural considerations with respect to the psychological process of homicide. In Taiwan, researchers who investigated this topic with Chinese cultural consideration undertook only narrative research based on a single participant, which only presented the specific experience from an individual’s perspective and thus generalization is limited. Therefore, there is a gap within the literature on this this topic area. This study is based on Chinese Relationalism perspectives and is designed to comprehensively construct the psychological mechanism behind this type of homicide. Participants of this study consisted of ten male prisoners who accused their partners of infidelity and were convicted of homicide. Consensual qualitative research (CQR) was applied to analyze interview scripts, along with consulting written verdicts, criminal records, and records maintained by social workers. The results revealed one characteristics category and four process categories. The former was “Personal thoughts: Male thinking related to fidelity based on Chinese Relationalism”. The later includes (a) Fundamental reasons: couple conflicts along with the loss of role understanding; (b); Proximate reasons: the emergence of hostility after losing trust; (c) Explosion: the worsening of intimate partner violence and accumulated rage leading to intimate homicide. (d) Looking back: regret. There were several implications from these results. Firstly, based on Chinese Relationalism, the interviewees’ homicide process seemed to be “a deterioration process resulting from the loss of role understanding to the emergence of hostility.” Secondly, based on the results, it could be hypothesized that “during the process of intimate partner homicide, the loss of trust and the emergence of hostility caused by partner infidelity might be an important reason for the worsening of intimate partner violence.” However, no research literature has discussed the role of the trust/hostile related to the intimate partner homicide caused by accusation of infidelity; thus, this would be an important area for future research to explore.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1803,49.3,2018,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The results reveal three main findings. First, on average, each radical has 2.66 permissible positions. Second, 33% of the 438 radicals exhibit extremely high position-based regularity (i.e., they only appear in one particular position). Third, only the factor “non-character” could predict high position-based regularity.

Relationship Between Child Sexual Aggression Intention and Practice and Its Impact Factors,Jiun-Yih Huang,"Child sexual aggression, Deviant sexual arousal, Intention and practice","Few studies have examined the relationship between criminal intention and practice. However, investigations in this field have implications in crime prevention. Sexual aggression against children causes severe harm to victims, has a prevalence, and is associated with major social concerns; therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between child sexual aggression intention and practice and its impact factors. An anonymous self-report questionnaire was adopted to collect data from 915 incarcerated males at Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung prisons in Taiwan and 559 male college students from 6public and private universities in Taipei and Hsinchu. The results show that the intention and practice of child sexual aggression are related. Child sexual aggression intention accounts for 13.7~28.0%, 2.2~8.4% variances of practice separately in male inmates and college students. Besides, deviant sexual arousal (pedophilia tendency), cognitive distortion (child sexual aggression myth acceptance), antisocial personality disorder tendency, and viewing child pornography are factors influencing the relevance of child sexual aggression intention and practice among male inmates. Antisocial personality disorder tendency, cognitive distortion, and viewing child pornography are factors influencing the relevance of child sexual aggression intention and practice among male college students. The impact factors and the amount of variance they can account for the relevance of child sexual aggression intention and practice are different in the two samples.

To this end, we used scientific texts describing the dispute of the relationships between climate changes and the Three Gorges Dam and developed assessment items according to our rubric. Test items included 10 close-ended and 9 open-ended questions and were categorized into 4 subscales: information retrieval, information generalization, information interpretation, and information integration. The results of analysis showed that the cronbach’s α values were more than .9, indicating that the intra-rater consistency was well. Secondly, the Kendall’s coefficient of concordance was more than .8 and its P value was smaller than .001, denoting a consistent scoring pattern between raters. Additionally, the analysis of many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) and the comparison of the rating scale model (RSM) and the partial credit model (PCM) showed that the chi-square test of rater severity and threshold difficulty were significant. The infit and outfit MNSQ of the former are between 1±0.3, meaning that both severe and lenient raters can distinguish high-ability students from low-ability students more effectively. The latter means that the rating procedures involve human interpretation, evaluation and scoring processes so that it is difficult to reach a machine-like consistency level. However, this is in line with expectations of typical human judgment processes. Thirdly, most values of Cronbach’s α of test items were larger than .7 except those from information retrieval and information generalization but overall they were all within acceptable range. Finaly, confirmatory factor analysis showed that there was an acceptable goodness-of-fit among the SMTRCA. The SMTRCA accounts for .60, .66, .80, and .80 of the variance associated with the first order factors of 4 subscales.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1793,49.2,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Do you ask for help? Exploring the Relations between Achievement Goal Orientations and Academic Adaptive/Nonadaptive Help-seeking/Help-avoidance Behaviors,"Shu-Ling Peng, Shu-Ling Peng, Shu-Ling Peng","Academic help-avoidance, Academic help-seeking, Adaptive behaviors, Nonadaptive behaviors, Persona goal orientations","The topic of academic help-seeking behavior has been extensively researched in past studies. Nevertheless, few studies explore both the help-seeking behaviors and its counterpart, namely, help-avoidance simultaneously. This study, accordingly, aims to achieve the following objectives: (a) developing the Academic Help-Seeking/Help-Avoidance Behaviors Scale and testing its validity and reliability; (b) clarifying the attribute of five help-seeking/help-avoidance behaviors as adaptive or nonadaptive; (c) investigating the relations between the achievement goal orientations and five help-seeking/help-avoidance behaviors. 1376 junior high school students were recruited in the study. Structure equation modeling was used for data analysis. The results showed that: (a) the Academic Help-Seeking/Help-Avoidance Behaviors Scale containing instrumental help-seeking, executive help-seeking, independent help-avoidance, covert help-avoidance, and complete help-avoidance had a good validity and reliability, indicating that the scale was suitable for examining the academic help-seeking/help-avoidance behaviors adopted by students in math; (b) instrumental help-seeking and independent help-avoidance could be regarded as adaptive behaviors, while executive help-seeking, covert help-avoidance, and complete help-avoidance were considered nonadaptive behaviors; (c) academic help-seeking/help-avoidance could be predicted by achievement goal orientation. Most specifically, approach-mastery goal could promote the adoption of adaptive help-seeking/help-avoidance behaviors but inhibit students’ tendency toward nonadaptive help-seeking/help-avoidance behaviors. The predictive effect of avoidance-performance goal on academic help-seeking/help-avoidance displayed the opposite result to that by mastery-approach goal. Based on these findings, pedagogical implications were discussed to offer reference for teaching and counseling.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1795,49.2,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Development of Mathematical Epistemological Beliefs Scale of Elementary School Teachers and Its Reliability and Validity Evaluation,Chin-Tang Tu,"Confirmatory factor analysis, Mathematical epistemological beliefs, Measurement invariance","This study aims at developing the Mathematical Epistemological Beliefs Scale (MEBS) suitable for elementary school teachers by evaluating its reliability and validity. The analysis consisted of two phases: pre-test and test. Both phases adopted stratified sampling method with elementary teachers of 251for the pre-test and 439 for the test respectively. Through exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, four factors were found: simplicity of knowledge, certainty of knowledge, source of knowledge, and justification of knowledge. The internal consistency of the Cronbach´s alpha of the MEBS was .80 for the total score of the 13 test items, which shows the high degree of reliability of the MEBS. This study further investigated the measurement invariance of the test. The results indicated that the same construct is being measured across different genders of the elementary school teachers, which confirmed high level of construct validity of the MEBS.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1796,49.2,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Changes in Parent-Child Relationship Satisfaction During Adolescence: The Effects of Ecological Contexts,"Huey-Ya Lin, Ying-Ling Hsiao","Adolescent, Ecological contexts, Parent-child relationship satisfaction","This study estimated the trajectory of changes in parent-child relationship satisfaction during adolescence over time. In addition, this study examined the effects of ecological contextual changes (including adolescent perceptions of parenting practices, the quality of parental marital relations, friends’ support, and school grades) on changes in parent-child relationship satisfaction. The data used in this study was drawn from wave 1, 3 and 6 in the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP), and a total of 1226 students completed 3 waves of data collection. The results of the growth curve models showed that parent-child relationship satisfaction significantly declined when the adolescent was in between 7th grade of middle school and the junior year of high school. Changes in parenting practices and parent’s marital satisfaction perceived by adolescents were associated with changes in father-child and mother-child relationship satisfaction. Adolescents who perceived their parents used more inductive reasoning, more monitoring behaviors, and less physical punishment were more likely to have a good relationship with their parents. Also, adolescents who perceived their parents had a satisfying marriage tended to have a better quality relationship with their parents. Changes in friends’ support and school grades were associated with changes in mother-child relationship satisfaction but not associated with changes in father-child relationship satisfaction. The findings of this study advance theoretical understanding of how parent-child relationships change during adolescence and provide some implications for practical application.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=274,49.1,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Word Association Norms and Associated Responses: Reference Index for 1200 Two-Character Chinese Words,"Jon-Fan Hu, Yen-Cheng Chen, Shu-Ling Zhuo, Hsueh-Chih Chen, Yu-Lin Chang, Yao-Ting Sung","Abstraction level, Commonality responses, Idiosyncratic responses, Valence, Word association norms","The word association task is one of the most important techniques to explore knowledge structures in human beings. It has been applied to the educational, clinical, and business research areas. Thus, establishing a comprehensive association norm that contains enough staple words as stimuli is a necessity. However, only a few association norms were established in Chinese, and these norms were often only prepared for words of particular categories. Hence, the goal of the present study was to establish a larger Chinese association norm covering more stimulated words. In the preliminary experiment, 30 subjects were asked to rate the level of abstraction of 900 frequent and 900 infrequent Chinese words with a 7-point scale. After deleting the words with large variability in abstraction ratings, there were 1800 Chinese words remaining. From this pool, 200 words from each combination of high/medium/low abstraction levels and frequent/infrequent words (six combinations in total) were chosen, resulting in a total of 1200 words chosen as word stimuli in the formal study. We also asked 104 subjects to rate the valence degree on these word stimuli in order to let follow-up researchers select the stimulus from the norm reported by the present study. In the formal study, 1200 subjects were recruited, and each performed a free association task with only 200 words among the word stimuli. An average of 200 responses were collected for each cue. Commonality, idiosyncratic index, and associated reference index of each stimulus word were analyzed. The result showed that commonality of low frequency or high abstraction words was higher than the commonality of high frequency or low abstraction words. It further indicated that low frequency or high abstraction words yielded more consistent and convergent associative responses. The association norms from our study could help future researchers explore the Chinese semantic network and manipulate experimental stimuli more carefully.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=276,49.1,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Development and Validation of a Career Calling Scale for Working Adults in Taiwan,"Yu-Chen Wang, Qing-Lin Wu","career calling, scale development, working adults","This study developed a career calling scale for working adults in Taiwan. In the first stage, the participants were 30 working adults over the age of 20. Focus group interviews were conducted to collect the data, that the author used to establish the scale as a pilot scale. In the second stage, three experts were invited to assess content validity. Then, a pre-test of the pilot scale was conducted to obtain 151 questionnaires, and the data was analyzed and selected under item analysis and factor analysis methods to establish a formal scale. The Career Calling Scale (CCS) contains 20 items rated on a 4-point scale and consists of four subscales: Interests and Passions, Life Meaning, Altruism, and Transcendent Summons. Higher scores people in each subscale show strong inclination toward that aspect. In the third stage, the participants were 548 working adults between the ages of 16 and 58 (M = 35.59, SD = 11.48). Reliability analysis indicated that the internal consistency of the four subscales was between .87 and .92, and the internal consistency of the whole scale was .97. The comparison of background variables showed that the scores for each subscale for social workers and enterprising workers were significantly higher than the scores for realistic workers. Using Job Satisfaction, Self-Efficacy, and Work Stress as criteria, the test showed high criterion-related validity. Confirmatory factor analysis also showed a good model fit, which supported good construct validity.

The Effect of Academic Competition and Coping Strategy on Students’ Psychological Distress,Chong-Shiann Hsu,"Academic competition, Coping strategy, Educational expectation, Psychological distress, Taiwan Education Panel Survey","This study examined the effect of academic competition and individuals’ academic competency and coping strategy on psychological distress among third-year students in senior high school. Data from the third and fourth wave of the Taiwan Education Panel Survey were used for this study. We excluded participants without complete responses and classes with less than five students taking part in this survey. There were 1,181 classes and over 15,000 students included in this study. Academic competition was defined operationally as class competition structure and classroom competition aura. Explorative factor analysis showed that class competition structure was composed of academic performance ranking, testing frequency, and misappropriation of deputy subjects time to main subjects. Classroom competition aura was represented by classmates’ educational expectation, academic competency, and coping strategies. First, hierarchical linear modeling was conducted, and it was found that after controlling for psychological distress in students’ second year, class competition structure and classmates’ coping strategies positively predicted psychological distress in the third year. Second, students with poor mental health in their second year experienced worsened psychological distress in their third year due to class competition structure. Third, students’ academic competency did not predict their psychological distress, and class competition structure did not moderate the prediction. Fourth, individuals’ educational expectation and coping strategy positively predicted their own psychological distress. The higher the educational expectation that peers had concerning future career, the more the individuals’ educational expectation negatively predicted their psychological distress.

Validation of the Learning Progression in Scientific Imagination: A Measurement Perspective,"Chia-Chi Wang, Hsiao-Chi Ho, Ying-Yao Cheng, Wen-Bin Chiou","BEAR assessment system, Learning progression, Rasch partial credit model, Scientific imagination","This study aimed to validate a learning progression (LP) for the scientific imagination (Authors, 2015) based on a measurement approach using the BEAR Assessment System (BAS; Wilson, 2005, 2009) in an attempt to better understand the core ideas and developmental path of the scientific imagination process as well as align curriculum, instruction, and assessment through LP. Participants in this study were selected from Taiwan and classified into two categories. The first category, which included 767 third to sixth grade elementary school students, was administered the Scientific Imagination Test-Verbal (SIT-Verbal). The second category consisted of two award-winning teachers who were interviewed in order to achieve more information for the LP. The SIT-Verbal, Imagery Questionnaire, and the outline of interview were used in this study. Among these, the SIT-Verbal covered four key components of the scientific imagination process: brainstorming, association, transformation/elaboration, and conceptualization/organization/formation. The Imagery Questionnaire covered imagery ability, which could generate imagery, objects, and pictures in one’s mind. For analysis, the multiple validities (Wolfe & Smith, 2007) of the SIT-Verbal were assessed using the Rasch partial credit model. The findings showed that (1) the BEAR assessment system and Rasch measurement approaches provided a feasible framework for developing validated tools to assess the LP of scientific imagination; (2) the empirical data supported that students’ scientific imagination progressed “from brainstorming, association, and transformation/elaboration to conceptualization/organization/formation.” Implications for the assessments with the LPs and revisions for both the SIT-Verbal and the scientific imagination LP are also proposed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=279,49.1,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Do people prefer to process and recall positive or negative feedback? Would the processing and memory of different feedback be affected by different outcome situations? These are the questions our research concerned. An experiment was conducted to examine the influence of outcome status (high score or low score) on the attending and memory of positive or negative feedback. The measurement of Mental Health was used to give a bogus score to manipulate the outcome status. We used an eye-tracking system to record the viewing time of feedback, and then asked the participants to recall and recognize the feedback. Overall, the results show that (a) participants would view negative feedback longer and recognize better than positive feedback so the resolution model was supported, and (b) outcome status would not influence the processing and recall of feedback because participants would view or recognize more of negative feedback regardless of high or low score outcome situations .

Preschoolers’ Achievement Goal Settings and Temperament Patterns,"Mei-Juan Kung,Keng-Ling Lay","achievement motivation, goal setting, preschooler, temperament patterns","Prior research has indicated that setting easy, intermediate, or difficult challenge goals may reflect the individual differences of achievement motivation. Individual differences in goal setting have also been found to relate with personality traits. The current study adopted Atkinson and Litwin’s (1960) ring toss paradigm to investigate the manifestation of individual differences of preschoolers’ goal-setting behaviors in their temperament patterns. One hundred and thirty-eight preschoolers (age range = 4 yr. 8 mo. to 7 yr. 0 mo.) participated individually in a ten-trial ring toss game. Children freely decided how far from the target they wanted to toss for each trial. Information of the goal setting and the success/failure of each trial were simultaneously made available to the preschoolers to help them make the goal setting decision for the future trials. After the game, they were then categorized into one of the three goal-setting styles of “Low Challenging,” “Moderately Challenging,” and “Unrealistic Challenging,” according to whether they often decided to toss from a distance nearer than, close to, or farther away from their current best tossing performance, respectively. Mothers filled up the Chinese version of Children’s Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), from which four motivation-related temperament indices of “surgency/extraversion”, “negative affectivity”, “effortful control” and “fear” were derived. A non-hierarchical cluster analysis was implemented on the four indices resulting in three patterns profiling preschoolers’ motivation-related temperament. Chi-square tests indicated that the proportion of children of different goal-setting styles distributed in the three temperament patterns differently. Specifically, preschoolers in the “Moderately Challenging” group were characterized by average levels of surgency/extraversion and above-average levels of fear, negative affectivity, and effortful control, suggesting potential compensatory mechanisms behind different temperament indices in regulating young children’s achievement motivation. This study highlighted the advantages of using temperament patterns rather than single temperament dimensions or factors to understand the individual differences of children’s goal setting behaviors.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=18,48.4,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

To assess the speech ability, most researchers use the total or average of the raw scores as final scores. However, when there are many students attending the test, raters need to be divided into several groups to provide grading, and the severity of the raters for different groups may impact students´ score. In this study, the scoring criteria, rater´s severity and person´s ability are all considered into the multifaceted Rasch model. The results show that, even for the trained raters, there still exist subjectivity and different level of rater severity. On the other hand, school principals feel most difficult in content, framework, proper usage of words and time control and feel relative easy in pronunciation, prosody, and appropriate manner in the context of impromptu speech.

This study investigated the current status of undergraduate caring-for-self and explored the differences in caring-for-self of undergraduates with diverse backgrounds. In total, 1,361 undergraduates participated in this study, which used the Caring-for-Self Inventory for Undergraduates as a valid and reliable instrument. The data obtained were statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics and a multivariate analysis of variance. The caring-for-self of the undergraduates surveyed was categorized into 5 dimensions: career, learning, spiritual, physical, and recreational. Among the 5 dimensions, the spiritual dimension was the most cared-for dimension of undergraduates, likely because of the influence of the Sunflower Student Movement which provided active discussion environment for undergraduates. Significant differences in undergraduate caring-for-self were observed for factors of grade, gender, religion, school location, and college. However, school sponsor and socioeconomic status factors revealed no significant difference on students’ caring-for-self. Compared with Noddings’s 4 vital concerns of peoples’ caring-for-self, undergraduate caring-for-self in this study contains an additional learning dimension and excludes religion from the spiritual dimension. The added learning dimension indicated the salient role of undergraduates, whereas the absence of religion from the spiritual dimension may result from the cultural differences between the United States and Taiwan.

The present study aims to investigate whether the global coherence of moral thinking develops by age. The researchers utilized four moral scenarios to evaluate the participants’ responses to two contradicting arguments regarding behaviors of stealing, lying, cheating in an exam, and breaking a promise. The degree of coherence was evaluated by the correlation of the two responses. Since assessment materials should be developed differently for younger children and older subject, the researchers designed two separate studies for different age groups: Study 1 for elementary school children, and Study 2 for older subjects. Study 1 results showed that sixth graders’ moral judgment was more coherent than third graders’ except for the “Breading Promise” scenario. Study 2 showed that college students’ moral judgment was more coherent than sixth graders’ except for the “Breaking Promise” scenario, as well. Taking both Study 1 and Study 2 into account, coherence of moral thinking increases by age which supports Piaget and Kohlberg’s theoretical hypothesis.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=23,48.3,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Students in the experimental group participated in a four-week forgiveness education course, while those in the control group participated in a course with integrated common activities. Results showed that students in the experimental group had higher scores on the forgiveness attitude and well-being post-tests than the students in the control group. Results indicate that enhancing 5th-graders’ well-being through forgiveness education is practical, acceptable, and highly effective. To achieve optimal effectiveness, the teachers should take into account the teaching environment, duration of time, and presence status of students.

Test of a model of future-oriented self-regulated learning and an examination of the moderating effect of classroom goal structures in the model.,Shu-Ling Peng,"classroom goal structures, future goal, personal goal orientation, self-regulated learning","This study integrates future goal theory and achievement goal theory. This study aims to (a) construct a model of future-oriented self-regulated learning to explain the relations among students’ distant goals, proximal goals, and self-regulated learning (SRL), and (b) investigate the moderating effect of students’ perceptions of classroom goal structures within the model. 768 junior high school students were recruited to participate in the study. Structure equation modeling was used for data analysis. The results showed that the proposed model was supported by the observed data and truly suitable to interpret the relations among future goals, personal goal orientation, and SRL among Taiwanese students. Future intrinsic goal was found to be most strongly related to approach-mastery goal, whereas future extrinsic goal most closely associated with approach-performance goal. Also, approach-mastery goal had the strongest positive influence on SRL. Regarding the moderating role, it was found that classroom goal structures moderated the relation between personal goal orientation and SRL; namely, the small, positive relationship between approach-performance goal and SRL was enhanced within mastery classroom goal structures but was reduced within performance classroom goal structures. This empirical study not only contributes to theory development but also sheds light on the practice of teaching and mentoring.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=25,48.3,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Longitudinal Study of Depressive Mood and Deviant Behavior in Taiwanese Adolescents,"Hui-Min Lai,Po-Wen Cheng,Chin-Pin Chen","adolescents, deviant behaviors, depressive moods, longitudinal study, Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS)","Many studies have explored adolescent depressive mood and deviant behavior separately, and much of this research is cross-sectional. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between depressive mood and deviant behavior, developmental changes, and gender differences in adolescents from 7th to 12th grade. Using a longitudinal approach, panel sample data were collected from 3,506 junior and senior high school students with the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (TEPS) in four waves in 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007. Data analysis was performed using the autoregressive cross-lagged model (ARCL) and the latent growth curve model (LGCM). Results showed the following: (1) Depressive mood and deviant behavior generally occur during ninth grade. Ninth grade is a critical turning point in adolescent development that often leads to depressive mood or deviant behavior. (2) Regarding differences in gender, girls experience a higher magnitude of depressive mood, and boys exhibit a higher magnitude of deviant behavior. (3) The correlation between the initial status of depressive mood and the initial status of deviant behavior was positive. (4) The cross-lagged effect of depressive mood on subsequent deviant behavior is significant, and the cross-lagged effect of deviant behavior on subsequent depressive mood is also significant, with boys and girls following significantly different paths when developing depressive mood and deviant behavior. Further suggestions are also presented based on the study results.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=26,48.3,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Variation of Professor-Student Affairs? -The Sexual Harassment Experiences of Female College Students,"Hsiu-Ling Peng,Li-Li Huang","female college students, sexual harassment between professors and students, the experiences of sexual harassment","This study investigated female college students´ experiences of sexual harassment by male professors. In-depth interviews were used to collect data. The participants in this qualitative research were 10 female students who had been sexually harassed by male professors during their undergraduate career; for six of the participants, the incidents had occurred within one year of the interview, whereas for the other four participants, the incidents had occurred over one year before the interview. Data collection and analysis were conducted based on the grounded theory. The results indicated that the participants went through a series of processes, which affected future adaptation. First, not being able to put a name to the harassment with confusion and discomfort. Then, self- persuasion to deny the truth in the reverence or acknowledgement or good- impression of the teacher, or tolerance, repression, or dissociation in fear and anxiety even when they confirmed and realized the truth. When they received support from others and discovered other victims, the awakened rage would activate the will to seek justice. This study also discussed how the relationships between professors and students had affected the incidents of sexual harassment. The results can be used as a reference in future investigations of sexual harassment and during counseling and psychotherapy.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=27,48.3,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Examining Learners’ Self-regulatory Behaviors and Their Task Engagement in Writing Revision,Karen Chung-chien Chang,"learner’s attitudes/beliefs, learner autonomy, Relative Autonomy Index, self-regulated behaviors","Autonomous learners are described as those who assume responsibility for and take charge of their own learning. However, research has pointed out that autonomy does not represent a fixed state but a developmental continuum, making it difficult to measure those in the transition of becoming autonomous. As one’s autonomy development can be explained by one’s self-regulatory behaviors, a learner’s development of autonomy can be investigated through how he/she evaluates his/her participation in a learning task. This study aimed to explore students’ self-regulation levels in the participation of writing assignments and revisions and their task engagement during the multi-drafting revision process. Twenty-eight students participated in this study. In an 18-week semester, the students were required to complete four writing projects, each with three drafts. The students received teacher feedback for revising their works. Data collection tools included one survey, students’ drafts, and one interview. The survey assessed the students’ learning attitudes/beliefs and their behavioral regulation; the writing drafts were used to identify their task engagement in revising from the first to the final drafts; the interview was further conducted to investigate factors affecting the students’ development of self-regulatory behaviors and task engagement. The findings showed that more than 90% of the students perceived writing as a good way to improve their analytical skills, master the English language, gain a sense of pride in their own ability, and enhance their future career. In addition, among the 28 students, 18 students demonstrated consistency between their Relative Autonomous Indexes (RAIs) and their task engagement levels. Another ten students were further interviewed, and their responses indicated that semester workload, extracurricular activities, and genre preference could impact one’s task engagement level in the revision process.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=28,48.3,2017,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploring the Processes of Summarization,"Chi-Shun Lien,Hung-Hui Chen,Yu-Htsuen Tzeng","macrostructure, summarization process, reading comprehension","According to Kintsch and van Dijk’s (1978) theoretical model, we investigated the summarization processes of children with different ages. By manipulating three versions of texts, this study measured the process of reading comprehension and investigated the relationship between reading ability and summarization for Chinese readers. Participants were 34 third graders and 34 sixth grades. They were asked to read three different versions of texts and then performed three cognitive tasks (free recall, summarization, textbase questions). The results showed that there were moderate correlations among the measures of summarization, free recall and text comprehension, but no correlations among the measures of deletion, generalization and construction processes. Sixth graders outperformed third graders on all cognitive tasks. Readers at different developmental stages exhibited a significant difference in the sub-process of children’s summarization skills. The performance on the deletion-version was better than that on the generalization-version and construction-version. Among them, the performance on construction-version was the worst. Only one-fifth of third graders and one-third of sixth graders could select topic sentences of the text correctly.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=29,48.2,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

There were two studies in this research. The first study collected discipline situations from a purposive sample of 30 teachers who teach in junior high schools with questionnaires, and identified top three disturbing discipline situations as: (a) disbehaviors in class and other repeated disbehaviors, (b) lower willingness to learn, and (c) disputements between peers. Based on the findings of the first study, the second study collected discipline strategies from 27 teachers who won the Positive Discipline Award with open-ended questionnaires. It was found that the most effective strategies in the top three disturbing discipline situations were: (a) use regulation effectively, (b) use counseling skills to solve problems, (c) instruct students to take responsibility for the consequences of their misbehaviors and accept discipline, (d) be a role model for students and use teaching skills effectively, (e) exert peer influence, (f) make good use of supporting systems, and (g) track afterward. Finally, a process chart of positive discipline was developed, concrete suggestions for teachers and education authorities were provided, and directions for future studies were discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=30,48.2,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

"How creative you will be depends on who you are: The relationship between personality traits, cognitive styles and different types of creativity","Chia-Yu Liu, Wei-Lun Lin, Ping-Hsun Tsai","personality trait, creativity, cognitive style, dual process theory","Past studies on individual differences in creativity rarely explored empirically the joint effect of personality traits and cognitive styles on creativity. Moreover, past studies often mixed different types of creative performance. According to the dual process account of creativity theory (Lin & Lien, 2013) and the duplex model of cognitive style theory (Sadler-Smith, 2009), experiential cognitive style may be associated with open-ended creativity; whereas closed-ended creativity may involve versatile cognitive style that combines experiential and rational cognitive styles. This study aimed to separate two types of creativity (open-ended and closed-ended) and investigate the role of personality traits and cognitive styles on the two types of creativity. The results showed that creative personality traits were positively correlated with both types of creativity, but different cognitive styles had different relationships with different types of creativity. Further analyses revealed that versatile cognitive style played a mediating role only on the relationship between personality traits and closed-ended creativity, but not on the relationship between personality traits and open-ended creativity. Open-ended creativity was instead more associated with experiential cognitive style. In particular, experiential cognitive style mediated the relationship between personality traits and fluency. These results clarify the relationships between personality traits, cognitive styles, and creativity, and have implication on teaching and creativity applications.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=32,48.2,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"On Teachers’ Background, Internal-external Locus of Control, and Interpersonal Competencies for Career",Peter Yang,"internal-external locus of control, interpersonal competencies for career, career success, demographic effects, teaching career","The study examined 122 primary school teachers’ career success, and its relations with background variables, internal-external locus of control, and interpersonal competencies for career (bonding and bridging social capital). Methodologically, structural equation modeling by Mplus was carried out to assess the fit of the hypothesized model. The results showed that the model fit the data well after a slight modification. Three major conclusions were drawn. Firstly, teachers’ perceived career success was positively related to their interpersonal competencies for bonding social capital for career. Secondly, having a child (children) and internal locus of control positively contributed to teachers’ interpersonal competencies for bonding social capital for career, while the competencies were negatively related with the external locus of control. Teachers’ career success was positively related to interpersonal competencies for bonding social capital for career. Thirdly, teachers’ interpersonal competencies for bridging social capital for career was positively related to the status of having a child (children) and having a managerial position, as well as to the internal locus of control. However, teachers’ career success was not significantly related to their interpersonal competencies for bridging social capital.

The Development of Self-affliction Tendency Scal,"Pei-Yu Wu, Ching-Wen Lin, Luo Lu","Self-affliction Tendency Scale, cross-validation, confirmatory factor analysis","The purpose of the study was to develop the Self-affliction Tendency Scale (SATS) for college students. Based on phenomenon observed and literature reviewed, the authors proposed a framework for studying the concept of “self-affliction” as a tendency of self-destruction in various aspects ranging from cognitive, emotional, behavioral, to interpersonal relationships. The SATS is comprised of 30 items in 7-point Likert-type scale and can be completed between 5 to 10 minutes. It included four dimensions: existential alienation, dysfunction, poor self-care, and contradictory relationship. The values of reliability and validity on the SATS were calculated from a sample of 2,679, all of which were Taiwanese undergraduate college students from ten universities. Accordingly, the internal consistency reliability (N = 172~1,050), test-retest reliability (N = 66 and 98), construct validity (N = 470), cross-validation (N = 519), and criterion-related validity of the developed scale (N = 172~1,050) were evaluated. Seven tests were conducted to relate the 4-dimension model to various psychological issues in the Taiwanese society. These issues included self-esteem, mental health, internet addiction, loneliness, depression, and happiness. Descriptive statistics, including means, variances, and item-total correlations, were computed for each item. The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, one-factor repeated measures analysis of variance, and discriminant analysis were conducted to differentiate the similarity and difference between variables. Internal consistency of the scores on SES and its subscales was estimated by Cronbach’s coefficient alpha (full scale was .94~.96, subscale of existential alienation was .81~.86, subscale of dysfunction was .93~.96, subscale of poor self-care was .76~.84, and subscale of contradictory relationship was .82~.90). Stability coefficient was based on 2 test-retest procedures (an interval of 2 weeks was .89, and an interval of 3 weeks was .72). Validation of the SATS was based on a 4-dimension model, followed by cross-validation on the calibration sample (N = 470) and validation sample (N = 519). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the model was well supported by observed data and the stability of the model was confirmed. The result had supported the scale structure. These evidences thus generally supported the 4-dimension self-affliction model. Applications of the SATS and the suggestions of future study were discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=34,48.2,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

This study used the sample data of indigenous people (N = 2057) of “Sampling and Implementation of Questionnaire Survey on Social Changes and Policy Assessment of Indigenous Peoples in Taiwan” in 2007 to investigate the influence of residences of indigenous peoples on their mental health through intervening variables of education, occupation, income, and social support. This study found indigenous people in townships had a lower educational level, occupation status, and income than those in urban areas. However, when individual background variables were controlled, the education gap between townships and urban area disappeared, and the occupations that were advantageous in plain townships became more remarkable. While education had a highly significant positive influence on mental health, the influence of occupation, income, and social support on mental health were insignificant. Moreover, there was no significant difference in mental health among indigenous people in the three residence areas.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=35,48.2,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
On Exploring Factors for Creative Science Teaching,"Wei-Wen Lin, Chia-Yu Liu","catreative teaching, creativity, instructional innovion, science teaching","Creative teaching is one of the effective ways to achieve the learning goals. If we could extract the critical factors from creative teaching process, we may offer support to teachers who desire to develop their creative teaching in a more effective way. Therefore, the main purpose of the current study is to explore the factors of creative science teaching and to improve teachers´ creative teaching ability. A structured Delphi questionnaire was developed based on the interviews of nine creative science-teachers and analysis of creative science-teaching programs (Lin & Liu, 2013). A two-round Delphi questionnaire survey was conducted to collect opinions from 14 scholars and teachers of science education to explore the factors of creative science teaching. Results indicated that among all the 22 creative science teaching factors, 6 factors were regarded as the most important: connect teaching to daily life, transform abstract to concrete, adopt cross-discipline/themes, use multiple assessments, use inquiry-based learning, as well as foster the ability of observing, independent thinking independently, and problem-solving.

Five hundred and nineteen 10th graders participated in this study, and the structural equation modeling technique was applied to analyze the data. The results indicated that different coping strategies correlated differently to parental attachment and that passive coping was significantly and positively related to adjustment problems while other coping strategies were negatively related to adjustment problems. Most importantly, attachment avoidance toward parents had significant indirect effects on adolescent adjustment problems through active coping and passive coping. Also, maternal attachment anxiety had both direct and indirect effects on adjustment problems through active coping and passive coping. On the other hand, paternal attachment anxiety had both direct and indirect effects on adjustment problem only through passive coping, but not active coping. Based on these findings, the authors recommend that interventions should be tailored to fit different needs of adolescents with high levels of paternal attachment anxiety and those with high levels of maternal attachment anxiety.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=37,48.1,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Understanding Children’s Conceptual Development of Distributive Justice along the Implicit-Explicit Dimension,"Hua-Nu Xu, Wan-Chi Wong","childhood, concept of distributive justice, moral development, Representational Redescription model","Based on the Representational Redescription model (Karmiloff-Smith, 1992), the present study investigated children’s conceptual development of distributive justice along the implicit-explicit dimension. In this microdevelopmental study, forty-two children aged 5 to 9 years were asked to complete the distribution tasks and to provide verbal explanations for seven hypothetical scenarios in the first step. They were then invited to complete the judgment task of imagining themselves as judges who had to evaluate the appropriateness of a child’s distributions in the seven scenarios. After making their judgment, the children received feedback on the appropriate distributions in the seven scenarios, which was presented in visual form as decisions of a large group of judges. In the last phase, the children completed another set of distribution tasks for seven similar scenarios and provided verbal explanations. Concerning the concepts of “equality” and “equity”, children’s performances were significantly higher on distribution behavior and judgment than on verbal explanation. Regarding the concepts of “need” and “integrated conception of justice”, there were no significant differences in children’s performances on distribution behavior, judgment, or verbal explanation; however, analysis including the data collected after feedback revealed significantly better performances on distribution behavior than verbal explanation. The same result was attained in a similar analysis in the post-feedback stage with regard to the concept of “distribution based on empathy”. Overall, children’s mastery of each subconcept of distributive justice showed differences in their representations along the implicit-explicit dimension. It is noteworthy that the effect of feedback was supported by the improvement in children’s mastery of the concepts of “equality”, “need”, and “distribution based on empathy” in the explicit representation. In the analysis of developmental trends by age, the 7-and 9-year-olds performed significantly better than did the 5-year-olds in their mastery of the concepts of “equality”, “equity”, and “integrated conception of justice”. By introducing a new theoretical and methodological approach to the study of children’s conceptual understanding of distributive justice, we found differentiated forms of implicit and explicit representations of distributive justice. This approach also enables the refined analyses of children’s developmental patterns with regard to the subconcepts of distributive justice along the implicit-explicit dimension. Taking consideration of the effects of the feedback on the development of children’s concept of distributive justice, this study sheds light on the practice of moral education by reminding us that children may acquire implicit understanding without educators’ explicit verbal explanation.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=38,48.1,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

We also offer future directions for research andclinical practice on this issue. After reviewing the diagnostic criteria and related assessment tools from the threeaspects of “substance abuse”, “impulsive control disorder” and “problematic internet use”,wealso included the compensatory use and neuropsychological /neuroimaging research findingsto obtain a picture of how the diagnostic indicators developed. We found that there were many psychiatric disordersassociated with internet addiction, butits diagnostic indicators cannot be developed solely based on the perspective of mental disorder. The psychometric properties of the assessment tools were validicated by many studies, but no concensus have been reached. The application of assessment tools shifted from a single scale to a package of tools with muti-dimensions and multiple assessing methods. Based onsuch findings, we recommend toinclude the experience of internet users as the foundational concepts for understanding the phenomenon of internet addiction, and propose a conceptual model to validate its constructs and formation process. Both the diagnostic criteria and assessment tools need to be reinvestigated. The clinician should obtain information from multiple perspectives of problematic internet users’ life experincesto offer interventions focused on their motivation, needs, and behavioral characteristics.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=39,48.1,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Regret and Psychological Adjustment: An Examination of the Dual-Route Mediating Effect of Self-Compassion and Self-Judgment,"Yi Cheng, Yi-Cheng Lin","psychological adjustment, reflection, regret, rumination, self-compassion.","research on regret mostly discussed the effects of various types of regretted events or investigated individual differences on some cognitive characteristics to explain why regret leads to psychological well-being or illness. The authors argued that the literature on regret ignored the emotional processes in which individuals often undergo a back-and-forth self-talk. An individual examines one’s own behaviors and the consequences of one’s own doings in the forms of reflection, rumination, encouragement, or blame. In such a dialogue, an individual establishes different types of relationship with oneself, which might be a very important key to understand the way in which regret impacts psychological adjustment. In this study, we used two factors of self-compassion to index the processes of self-talk, and hypothesized that different self-compassion factors mediated the relationships between regret and psychological adjustment. The results showed that when facing regret, decent reflections increased self-compassion, which in turn increased well-being; on the other hand, it is through self-judgment which made ruminating individuals trapped in regretful mood and in turn negatively impacted well-being. The authors also discussed the role self-compassion could play when facing negative events and how self-integration is possible.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=40,48.1,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Comparison of Two Mathematics Problem-Solving Strategies of Line-Diagram Representations on Learning Achievements,"Yi-Hung Huang, Jin-Tai Shie","cognitive load theory, line diagram, representations","This research is to study how the two mathematics problem-solving strategies, length and proportional line-diagram representations, affect sixth grade students’ cognitive load and learning performance during they study the unit of “baseline and comparison”. The researchers adopted Schnotz’s integrated model of text and picture comprehension to analyze the cognitive process of studying worked examples with line diagram, and compare the differences in term of cognitive load between the two methods based on cognitive load theory. Then, the researcher conducted a three phases of true-experimental design to show the effectiveness of our analysis. The experimental results show that the proportional line-diagram condition performed significantly better than the length line-diagram condition on post-tests, and after the students had learned the unit of “ratio”, the difference between the length line-diagram condition and the proportional line-diagram condition on delay-test are not significant.

An Investigation of Core Competencies in Psychological Assessment: Comparing the Evaluation between Interns and Supervisors,"Ya-Han Hsu, Yu-Ling Lan, Wan-Lan Chen","clinical psychology interns, competency-based assessment, psychological assessment","Psychological assessment is one of the core competencies in professional psychology and an important training domain for clinical psychologists to function well in practice. The purposes of this study were (1) to measure psychological assessment competency (PAC) for master’s level interns and (2) to investigate the current psychological assessment education and training in Taiwan. Thirty dyads of clinical psychology interns and their supervisors were recruited as participants for the study. They were assessed with a questionnaire (including the internship version of the Psychological Assessment Competency Scale (PACS-I) and other questions) at the beginning and the end of internship. The PACS-I required both interns and supervisors to evaluate the interns’ competencies in psychological assessment. The PACS-I included 15 5-point Likert scale items grouped into three domains: knowledge of psychological testing, assessment skills, and interpersonal relationship. The results indicated that interns at the beginning of the internship considered themselves having the best performance on the interpersonal relationship domain, and their performance on the other two domains would require further enhancement. At the end of the internship, interns considered themselves to have significantly improved on all three PACS-I domains. A similar pattern was shown on supervisors’ post-internship PACS-I ratings of their interns in comparison to the pre-internship ones. To maximize the internship training effects, supervisors suggest that interns meet the following four basic competencies before entering internship: three PACS-I domains and knowledge of differential diagnosis. Due to the small sample size and most participants being recruited from the division of psychiatry in the hospital, the findings of this study may not generalize to other training sites.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=52,47.3,2016,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

In this study, the impacts of approach-mastery goal structure and multiple goal structure on self-regulated learning strategies (SRL) were compared and changes of these impacts over time wereinvestigated with a quasi-experimental approach. Six classes with 152 [WM[1] seventh-grade junior high school students in Taipei City participated in this study. All the classes were conducted as individual study groups for different manipulations,including 3 distinct levels: approach-mastery classroom goal structure, multiple classroom goal structure, and control group. The effects of classroom goal structures on SRL were examined at 3 stages: pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test. The results showed that there were significant two-way interactive effects between the classroom goal structures and measurement occasions on motivational/affective regulation (MR) and contextual regulation (CR) strategies. We found that multiple classroom goal structures had the best impact on students’ adaption of SRL because of its positive effects on MR and CR for both the post-test and delayed post-test; approach-mastery goal structure had minor positive effects on MR and CR because of its positive effects for only the post-test and not delayed post-test; the average scores for MR and CR in the control group declined or showed low-levels with time.

To Re-Understand Peak-Experience Base on Zen Meditation Experience,"Yi-Ru Tzeng, Cheng-Chang Lin","peak experience, phenomenology, Zen meditation experience","The purposes of this study were to re-understand the peak experience from the perspective of the Zen meditation experience. Through meditators’ different experiences, a variety of aspects of the peak experience could be reexamined to further discover its essence. Moreover, the study aims to clarify public myths toward the peak experience and this issue would be received more attention in academia. [AK1] This study adopted phenomenology as the methodology of this study. The transcripts of conversation recordings from eight Zen mediators were analyzed, and the results were as follows: (1) All of the peak experience, the plateau experience and the Zen meditation experience descend from the same origin which expects that human beings should weaken the boundary of ‘ego’ and focus on ‘self’. However, it shows that the peak experience is not equivalent to the Zen meditation experience. There are differences which existed in the depth and the width between the two experiences. Previous studies provided more details about the Zen meditation experience than the peak experience. (2) There are no fixed images of the peak experience. (3) The trigger is not necessary for approaching the peak experience. Therefore, those essentially the same activities such as Yoga and Taichiquan , are also helpful for the transformation of the body and soul and realizing the essence of the peak experience. (4) The essence of the peak experience lies in the idea of ‘self-transcendence’. The nature of the peak experience is for validating the world view and humanity view of transpersonal psychology. That is, we try to be aware of the existence of ‘self’ to achieve the goal of ‘self-actualization’ and to further reach for ‘self-transcendence’. We go beyond the temporary ‘ego’ and accomplish the ‘real self’.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=144,47.2,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

One of the environmental factors is the variation in the language systems. The purpose of this study is to investigate the developmental changes in the semantic content and composition of early expressive vocabulary in Mandarin-speaking infants and toddlers. Parent report data (N = 1897) was collected using the Mandarin-Chinese Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI), and the results showed that the trend in the development of early expressive lexicons in Mandarin-speaking infants and toddlers were similar to those with other language backgrounds. The semantic content of the early expressive vocabulary was mostly related to the toddlers’ daily life, and the major grammatical category was nouns. Different developmental trends were found for different categories: nouns, verbs, and adjectives grew rapidly in the early stage while closed-class words showed a slow and continuous growth across the development of expressive vocabulary. In addition to the theoretical aspect, the detailed list of the age of acquisition for individual items provided in this study could be used to examine vocabulary development in children with language disorders and to design intervention programs in clinical settings.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=146,47.2,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Problem and Effect of Developing the Executive Function Curriculum for Economic Disadvantaged Children,Ya-Ling Chen,"early childhood curriculum, economic disadvantage children, executive function, scaffolding strategy","The purposes of this research were to develop the executive function curriculum for economic disadvantaged children, and to evaluate the problem and Effects of the EF curriculum. Data collection methods of the problems with developing and implementing the EF curriculum included regular discussion, film recording, and teaching reflection. Data of the Effectiveness of the EF curriculum were collected through observation in developing curriculum stage, and through EF tests in experimenting stage. Data of the problem with implementing EF curriculum were analyzed qualitatively. Data of the Effectiveness of the curriculum were analyzed using statistic methods. The experimental class of students consists of 90% of the economically disadvantaged children. The research results show that: the main problems of developing the EF curriculum includes: the lack of basic skills in “learning partnership” and “representing-planning-implementing-evaluating”, which needs time to establish these skills. In addition, the scaffolding design often neglects the low-ability or inner children’s needs. The Effect evaluation shows that: when implementing the EF curriculum, teachers are more sensitive to children who have EF weakness. The intervention of teachers’ EF teaching can often promote children’s EF ability. Besides, the result of EF tests shows that children’s EF ability has significant progress. However, the Effect of EF curriculum cannot exclude the influence of children’s maturation because of the one-group pretest-posttest design. In the final part, researcher provides discussion and suggestion in the aspects of “EF implementing strategy”, “age effect on EF ability”, “evaluating methods of EF ability” and “controversial issue of EF concept”.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=148,47.2,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effectiveness of Neurofeedback-Based Neuropsychotherapy on Improving Meta-Attention Functions for Children with ADHD,"Yu-Chi Liao, Nai-Wen Guo, Shin-Jaw Chen, Hsing-Fang Tsai, Bei-Yi Su","ADHD, CATS, meta-attention, neurofeedback, neuropsychotherapy","Neurofeedback (NF) training technique can effectively reduce inattention and behavioral symptoms in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) based on a meta-analysis study of Arns et al. (2009). Yet, there are two concerns that need be addressed. First, most training programs developed from the NF technique last for more than 40 hours. Second, little efforts had been put to the neuropsychological function, especially training effects on improvement of meta-attention and executive functions. Thus, this study was aimed to establish a novel neuropsychotherapy training program with a shorter training time and to investigate if it has multi-level mental function training effects. Combined Comprehensive Attention Training Systems (CATS) and the concept of autonomy throughout the whole training process with NF technique developed into a novel neuropsychotherapy program, called Will Well NF (WWNF). The training course for WWNF lasts 20 hours. Twenty-two ADHD children were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON group) or an experimental group (WWNF group). The CON group, after taking interview and pretests, kept original treatment protocols until posttests were done after 10 weeks. The WWNF group, after taking interview and pretests, received additional WWNF training for 10 weeks until posttests were done. This study used indices from three levels of evidences to discuss the curative effects, including clients’ neuropsychological functions and behavioral and learning adaptive questionnaires reported by their parents. The two-way repeated measured method (ANOVA) and bootstrapping method of a dependent T-test were used for statistical analysis. An F-test revealed that there were interaction effects in both neuropsychological and behavioral questionnaire levels. Compared to the CON group, the WWNF group made less delay errors and omission errors, more correct responses, reduced reaction time among attentional assessments in neuropsychological tasks, decreased inattention and ADHD symptoms in SNAP, and better daily attention function reported by parents in the questionnaire level. Improving time management behaviors reported by parents within WWNF group were also noted. This study suggested that ADHD children improve in mental functions, including attention monitoring and executive functions, and daily life behaviors after WWNF. Even though the sample size in this study was small, it proved the effect of WWNF. Future studies should increase the sample size to discuss individual impacts on effectiveness, follow up on the maintenance of effectiveness, and apply the method to different mental disabilities.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=149,47.2,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Negative Emotion Regulation Strategies Scale for Children and Adolescence,"Jia-Ru Li, Ching-Wen Lin","emotion regulation, emotional regulation strategies, SEM","Purpose: This research seeks to develop a new measurement tool on negative emotion regulation to identify how children regulate their negative emotions. Methods: The “Negative Emotion Regulation Strategies Scale for Children” (NERSC) was administered. Subjects during pretest (N = 238) and formal testing (N = 878) wereall fifth to sixth-grade elementary school students in Taiwan. Through questionnaire survey, data was collected and analyzed using item analysis, principal component analysis,pearson product-moment correlation, multivariate analysis of variance, and Structural Equation Models. Results: The results are as follow. First, through literature review, a research framework was constructed. The pretest questionnaire contained 39 items and includedsix categories. Expert validity was established through the review from three experts in child psychology. Factors extracted from item analysis and principal component analysis wereused to delete and revise items based on pretest results. Second, a seven-point Likert scale was adapted for the 36 items on the formal testing version of the NERSC.Six strategies were: negative emotion clarification, negative emotion expression, negative emotion inhibition, negative emotion venting, negative emotiontransfer regulation strategies, and negative emotion acceptance. The internal consistency of the six strategies ranged from .63 to .89, and their test-retest reliability ranged from .63 to .86. Third, confirmatory factor analysis, conducted on both the calibration and validation samples, provided evidence supporting a 6-factor structure of the NERSC. Finally, significant differences in strategies were found among different grades and genders. Boys adopted more emotional venting strategies and less emotional expression strategies than girls. Sixth grade children adopted more strategies than fifth grade children. Conclusions: Based on the findings shown above, the NERSC can be useful for understanding the emotional regulation strategies of children in counseling and education.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=150,47.1,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

An Evaluation of the Reliability and Validity of the Mathematical Metacognition Scale,Chin-Tang Tu,"confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory factor analysis, mathematical metacognition, measurement invariance","The main purpose of this study was to develop the Mathematical Metacognition Scale (MMS) on 5th – 8th graders in elementary and junior high schools. The present study included two phases: pretest and test. By adopting purposeful sampling and cluster sampling in both phases, 457 and 861 students were selected for the pretest and the test, respectively. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were conducted with the pretest data. The confirmatory factor analysis resulted in three factors including metacognitive knowledge, planning and monitoring, and evaluation. The Cronbach´s alphas of the MMS subscales were .87, .87, .72, and .90 for the total score, which indicated good reliability. Measurement invariance was conducted to the test and indicated gender invariance. Therefore, it showed that the MMS has good construct validity.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=155,47.1,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Development of Mother-Infant Bonding Inventory,"Pey-Ling Shieh, Tsung-Ho Ying, Ren-Hau Li, Pao-Chun Hsieh","anxiety, depression, Mother-Infant Bonding Inventory, perinatal mental health, social support","Mother-infant bonding is defined as a mother’s thoughts, feelings, and commitment toward her baby. Bondingis important to the wellbeing of mothers and infants. The study aimed at developing a reliable and valid Chinese Mother-Infant Bonding Inventory that can be applied at the immediate postpartum period. An initial version of the inventory was developed based on the qualitative study (Shieh et al., 2012). Women who gave birth in Taichung were invited to fill the initial version of the inventory within the fifteen days postpartum. Demographic information, as well as mothers’ psychosocial status during both pregnant and postpartum periods were also collected. A valid sample witha total of 567 women was obtained. After item analysis, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, a 25-item, four-factor inventory was derived. The four factors were Proximity, Parental Adjustment, Commitment and Confidence of Reciprocity. For the reliability, internal consistency coefficients of Cronbach’s alpha for the whole inventory and four sub-scales ranged between .82~.90. The Pearson’s correlationamong four sub-scales ranged between .18~.60. The factor structure of the inventory was consistent with its conceptual analysis. For criterion validities, relationships between bonding and demographics, pregnant and postpartum psychosocial status were found to be consistent with the literature. For example, participants with higher anxiety or depression scores in their pregnancies showed lower bonding scores. With regard to the postpartum psychosocial status, degrees of depression and anxiety were negatively correlated with the bonding scores. Degree of social support was positively correlated with the bonding scores. We conclude that the Mother-Infant Bonding Inventory has adequate reliability and validity and can be use to evaluate the relationship between Chinese women and their infants.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=156,47.1,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

An investigation of the causal mechanisms behind the male sexual victim-perpetrator cycle,Jiun-Yih Huang,"male sexual victimization, sexual offense, sexual victim-perpetrator cycle","The phenomenon of male sexual victims becoming sexual perpetrators is called the sexual victim-perpetrator cycle. Reviewing past research investigating the causal mechanisms behind the sexual victim-perpetrator cycle, it was found that a theoretical proposition is needed to explain how this cycle occurs. This study therefore proposed causal factors behind the sexual victim-perpetrator cycle from a theoretical standpoint to make up for the lack of past research in this area. This study proposed the following four factors linking sexual victimization and sexual offenses: the victim’s perception of the sexual perpetrator’s positive feelings toward the sexual-offending behavior; the victim’s increasing reinforcement from being sexually victimized; the endangerment of the victim’s masculinity; and the increased accessibility of sexual-offending behavior after being sexually victimized. In addition, past research that looked at family factors and a history of sexual victim experiences was examined. Participants included 472 male inmates from Taipei and Kaohsiung prison and 395 male juveniles from Taoyuan and Changhua juvenile reform schools in Taiwan for a total 867 male participants. An anonymous self-report questionnaire was used to collect data. The results of this study showed that the increased tendency towards sexual-offending behavior after being sexually victimized acted as a mediator of sexual victimization and sexual offenses in the juvenile offenders sample. No single factor had a significant effect on the sexual victim-perpetrator cycle in the adult offenders sample. The increased accessibility of sexual-offending behavior after being sexually victimized had a significant effect, and the endangerment of the victim’s masculinity had a marginally significant effect on the sexual victimization and sexual offense link in the sample of juvenile and adult offenders. Finally, the implications, applications, and limitations of this study, and directions for future research were addressed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=157,46.4,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The construction of CIAS-P is based on the framework of the Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS) and the Chen Internet Addiction Scale-Children Version (CIAS-C), and is modified with other relevant literature and expert opinions. This research mainly utilized pair sampling procedures. Two stages were included in this study. The participants in the first stage were 360 5th-6th -graders and their parents sampled from Taoyuan county and Kaohsiung city. For reliability, the Cronbach´s α value was .83-.91. An exploratory factor analysis showed that CIAS-P revealed three factors: core symptoms, interpersonal and health problems, and time management problems. These three factors accounted for 64.73% of the total explained variance. For validity, there was a moderate correlation between scores on CIAS-P and CIAS-C. In the confirmatory factor analysis, the absolute and parsimony indices were acceptable (RMSEA = .08、GFI = .76、SRMR = .02、IFI = .94、NNFI = .93、NFI = .90、CMIN/df = 2.25、PNFI = .80. The participants in the second stage were 164 1st-4th graders’ parents sampled from Taoyuan county.

Although some scholars proposed that these two theories are related, few empirical studies have explored the relations between them. Therefore, the main purpose of this study was to examine the model on the associations among self-determination motivation, goal orientation, and motivational engagement through a structural equation modeling approach. The participants were 1305 junior high school students. In general, results supported all hypotheses. First[E1] of all, autonomous motivation positively predicted approach-mastery, avoidance-mastery, and approach-performance goals, and negatively predicted avoidance-performance goals. Controlled motivation positively predicted avoidance-mastery, approach-performance, and avoidance-performance goals, and negatively predicted approach-mastery goals. Next, approach-mastery and approach-performance goals positively predicted adaptive motivational engagement and approach-performance goals negatively predicted maladaptive motivational engagement. Finally, avoidance-performance goals negatively predicted adaptive motivational engagement and positively predicted maladaptive motivational engagement.

Gender Differences in Mother-Child Conversations about Past Emotions,"Pei-Ling Wang, Chen-Yu Chiu, Jon-Fan Hu, Yu-Ting Huang","gender differences, mother-child conversation, past emotion","The emotional meaning of previous experienced events emerges from retrospection. Mother-child conversations are contexts in which emotional narratives are built and where children acquire emotional values or meanings. In this study explored gender differences for emotional words that mothers and their 48-month-old (averaged) children used to communicate regarding past experiences. Participants included 20 mother-son dyads and 20 mother-daughter dyads. Data were collected during home visits on conversations of shared previous events between mothers and their only child on four specific emotion experiences: happiness, anger, sadness, and fear. The results showed that there was no difference in the amount of the emotional words used between mothers and boys or mothers and girls in the conversations. Additionally, with sons, mothers tended to talk about happy experiences through questioning, but fearful experiences through clarifying and guiding manners. In contrast, with daughters, mothers were found to frequently use guiding manners to discuss sad experiences. Across genders, no difference was found on words used to talk about regulating negative emotions. Based on the results, we propose longitudinal monitoring of the socialization processes of emotion development, then analyzing the variation and elaboration of emotional word use between mothers and children in order to equate the emotion development between boys and girls and encourage conversations involving emotional experiences.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=188,46.3,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
A Longitudinal Study on Sentential Complements and Theory of Mind in Native Chinese-Speaking Children and Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Hui-Li Lin, Shu-Pei Yang, Shin-Yu Yang, Pei-Hsuan Li","autistic spectrum disorders, children , Chinese language, sentential complement, theory of mind","Theory of mind (ToM) has been known as one of the main developmental deficits in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). It is therefore both theoretically and practically important to observe how the two concepts correlate with each other in individuals with ASDs. The current study aimed to longitudinally investigate this issue in Mandarin-speaking children and adolescents with ASDs. Forty-two children and adolescents were followed for about a year and tested at two time points approximately a year apart. Theory of mind scores at time 1 and time 2 were measured with both verbal and non-verbal ToM tasks. Comprehension of sentential complements (SC) was also tested at the two time points with cognition (“think”) and communication (“say”) verbs of both true and false complementation. Our findings show that SC at time 1 can successfully predict ToM at time 2 while controlling for chronological age, general language production abilities and ToM at time 1. However, ToM at time 1 cannot successfully predict SC at time 2 given the same controlled conditions. Thus, the results suggest that the comprehension of sentential complements should play a causal role in ToM development in Mandarin-speaking children and adolescents with ASD. However, our findings regarding how each of the fourtypes of SC independently contributes to ToM abilities a year later are not totally consistent with past research done with English-speaking participants. Some possible reasons for the differences have been discussed.

Affair and Splitting: An Interpretative study of the Experiences of an Unfaithful Husband,"Hao-Yi Hsu, Yu-Nung Lee","extramarital affairs, Hermeneutic Phenomenology, Object Relations Theory, splitting","“Splitting”, as stressed in the Object Relations Theory, is a very important psychological state in human development. It refers to a sense of contradiction and conflict of “being split into all good or all bad” formed since birth through perceptions of significant others and surrounding environments, which are sometimes good and sometimes bad. When a baby does not have sufficient knowledge to understand why significant others are sometimes upset and sometimes happy, he/she would instinctively exclude some feelings and characteristics （usually bad ones） in order to protect himself/herself from external disturbances. This process of excluding some parts of feelings and characteristics is called “splitting” in the Object Relations Theory. We found from clinical experience in marriage counseling that the psychological state of “splitting” and whether the split parts can be integrated back to the self are quite important for healthy marital relationships. Couples who repeatedly have affairs are often deeply affected by the state of “splitting”. This study is aimed to examine how “splitting” works in an affair and how integration of internal splitting was carried out by unfaithful husbands through their marriages. Data was collected by conducting five in-depth interviews with a man who had been unfaithful to his wife. Based on the Hermeneutic Phenomenology approach, data analysis was further performed through discussions and dialogues between the interviewee’s narratives and the theoretical texts with regard to “splitting” in the Object Relations Theory. This study found that the “split” affections of unfaithful husbands consist of four layers: （a） experiencing the state of “splitting” between the good and the bad of external object in adulthood intimate relationships; （b） experiencing the good and the bad of self in the extramarital affairs; （c） experiencing the mutual exclusion and conflicts between the id and the superego during the affairs; and （d） becoming aware, while struggling with the affairs, of the unresolved “split” affections from the family of origin. In the integration of “split” affections, there are also four corresponding processes: （a） integrating the good and bad affections through the “good-enough” sexual experiences; （b） experiencing the integration of good and bad on the proposed, constant object; （c） accepting the maternal and super-ego images projected onto the partner; and （d） becoming aware of the unresolved issues from the family of origin that are carried over to the current marital relationship. It is believed that an affair can be considered as “acting out” the internal “split” affections. When rebuilding a marriage after an affair, we must work on not only healing the pain and loss of the betrayed but also help the unfaithful partner to understand where this undermining impulse came from. In addition, the “reconstruction of sexual relationships” might be an essential factor in counseling marriages involving affairs, for it enables the unresolved issues formed in the families of origin to emerge onto the consciousness where they can be worked on by the couple.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=187,46.3,2015,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Patterns of Interaction and Adolescent Problem Behaviors: An Investigation of Maternal and Adolescent Perceptions,Huey-Ya Lin,"adolescent, parenting alliance, parenting practice, problem behavior","There were two aims of the present study. One aim was to examine maternal and adolescent perceptions of patterns of parenting interaction which were made up of clusters of parenting alliance and parenting practices, as well as the differences in adolescent problem behaviors among various patterns of parenting interaction. The other aim was to examine consistent or inconsistent patterns based on pairs of mother a nd adolescent perceptions of patterns of parenting interaction, as well as the differences of adolescent problem behaviors among these patterns. The subjects of the present study were 301 pairs of junior high school students and their mothers. The instruments included the “Parenting Alliance Scale,” “Parenting Practices Scale,” and “Depression and Aggression Scales.” The results showed that maternal perceptions of these three patterns were “high positive and cooperative pattern,” “high negative and conflict pattern,” and “keeping-distant pattern.” Adolescent perceptions of these three patterns were “high positive and cooperative pattern,” “high negative and conflict pattern,” and “low positive and low cooperative pattern.” In addition, for maternal perceptions of patterns, adolescents in the “high negative and conflict pattern” showed significant higher levels of depression and aggression than adolescents in the “high positive and cooperative pattern.” For adolescent perceptions of patterns, adolescents in the “high negative and conflict pattern” and “low positive and cooperative pattern” showed significant higher levels of depression and aggression than adolescents in “high positive and low cooperative pattern”. Moreover, adolescent girls showed higher level of depression than adolescent boys. For both adolescent depression and aggression, “negative and consistent patterns” and “inconsistent patterns” showed higher levels than “positive and consistent patterns.” The present study may improve our understanding of interactions of family subsystems and their effects on adolescent problem behaviors.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=178,46.2,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The effects of order of mention in zero pronoun resolution for young Chinese readers,"Chiu-Hua Huang, Yuhtsuen Tzeng, Wei-Ming Luh","order-of-mention, the advantage of first mention, zero pronoun resolution","Pronoun resolution is vital for building a coherent mental representation during comprehension. Yet, sentences with zero pronouns occur frequently in our elementary textbooks. Little is known about what factors and how they may affect young reader´s zero pronoun resolution processing. Thus, this study aims to describe Chinese children’s zero pronoun resolution development. A total of 206 2nd-5th grade students were selected with 43-52 from each grade. By adopting a two-way ANOVA mixed design, we investigated the influence of order of mention of pronoun on reaction time in the situation where gender semantic features cues were absent in the text. The results indicated that the older the students, the shorter the reaction time for zero pronoun resolution. Moreover, for the 5th graders, the reaction time for resolving the first-mentioned pronoun was faster than that for the second-mentioned. Therefore, the first-mention advantage is a stable phenomenon on zero pronoun resolution for these age groups. However, there was no significant effect on order of mention for 2nd-4th graders. We provide suggestions for future research and instruction implications based on these findings.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=180,46.2,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Examining the Appropriateness of Teaching Sequence of Chinese Characters in Chinese Elementary School Textbooks,"Yu-Hsiang Tseng, Chih-Wei Hue, Ming Lo, Meg Lu, Ching-Ching Lu","CDE index, character properties, Chinese characters, Chinese textbooks, teaching sequence","An elementary school student in Taiwan is expected to learn 2500~2900 different Chinese characters from Chinese textbooks. The purpose of the present research is to evaluate the appropriateness of the arrangement of character sequences in textbooks. One hundred and fifty one experienced elementary school teachers of Chinese descent participated in Study 1. They were asked to evaluate the relative importance of 9 properties of Chinese characters, including character usage in writing, features of character orthography, and complexity of character phonology and semantics, when selecting characters to teach. The participants indicated that properties such as “frequency of use in children’s books” and “number of words included as morpheme” are important and should be considered in every grade. They also found that, “number of character strokes” is important for grade 1 and 2, and “frequency of use in children’s own writing” should be considered in grade 5 and 6. Based on the findings of Study 1, Study 2 evaluated how the potential characters to be learned were arranged in Chinese textbooks published by three publishers. The results showed that although the characters in the textbooks published by the same publisher were selected and arranged in accordance with the sequence indicated by character properties, there was much variation regarding the selection and learning sequence arrangement of the characters among the publishers. For example, between two publishers, there could be 20~30% difference on the characters to be learned included in the textbooks. All together, the potential characters to be learned in about 15% of the articles were misplaced in the teaching sequence. Moreover, a database containing about 5900 different characters and their properties has been built, and a computer program utilizing the database to analyze the characters in an article has also been designed. The database and program will be available on the internet.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=181,46.2,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Construction of the Computerized Adaptive Career Aptitude Test for Junior High School Students,"Yu-Wen Cheng, Po-Hsi Chen, Yao-Ting Sung, Shin-Hau Chen, Meng-Ting Hsiao","adaptive test, aptitude test, career development, career test","A qualified career test could play an important role in providing information for students’ self-understanding and career decision-making. However, there are limitations and problems within the existing career aptitude tests in Taiwan. This study integrates psychological testing, adaptive techniques of psychometrics, and multimedia technology to establish a computerized adaptive career aptitude test (CACAT - J). The CACAT - J consists of brand new subject matters, dimensions and test items. Not only is the test more relevant with increased prediction power, but it also provides beneficial career counseling for students and teachers. The CACAT - J consisted of eight sub-tests: Verbal, Numerical, Spatial, Logical Reasoning, Scientific Reasoning, Observation, Aesthetics, and Creativity. There were 5820 participants in the present study. Reliability for the findings in this study ranged from .69 to .81. In terms of validity, the aptitude test scores were significantly correlated with junior high school students’ basic competence tests and ranged from .28 to .67. Through this test, students were able to understand their aptitudes on different skills that would enhance their career exploration and their capacity for effective career decision-making and planning.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=182,46.2,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Clusters of Humor Expression and Related Factors among Junior High School Students in Taiwan,"Yi-Chen Chiang, Hui-Shan Sheng, Wen-Chi Wu, Lee-Lan Yen","adolescent, cluster, humor expression, Taiwan","Little research has examined the aggregation of humor expression among adolescents. The purposes of this study were to understand the natural clusters of types of humor expression among youth in Taiwan and to discover any related background factors that may shape these aggregations of humor styles. A nationwide survey was conducted of 1,639 students in the seventh to ninth grades. Participating junior high schools were randomly selected in Taiwan. Cluster analysis was used to explore types of humor expression. Multinomial logistic regression modeling was used to examine factors related to types of humor expression. The sample was divided into four clusters based on humor expression and personality: (a) frequent use of various humor types (16.1%); (b) used of deprecating humor group (26.7%); (c) non-hurtful witty group (22.4%); and (d) serious or austere (or rarely use of humor) group (34.9%). Individual (e.g., grade, birth order, academic performance, perceived stress and allergy-related problems) and family factors (e.g., mother’s education, parent’s marital status and family income) were related to clusters of humor expression. Our study discovered that different aggregations of humor expressions exist among youth and that significant associations exist between different background factors and the natural clusters. Based on our study results, we recommend early contact with junior high school students to help establish positive ways that they can express their humor during this crucial period of time. Such insights may very well lead to educational programs or coursework that can enhance students’ understanding of the proper use of humor and its overall role in society.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=183,46.2,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Care-for-Self of Undergraduates: An Analysis via 3W*,Ding-Ying Guo,"care, self, undergraduate","The purpose of this study is to investigate the phenomenon of undergraduates´ care-for-self. Forty undergraduates were interviewed to understand their care-for-self by assessing what they cared about, when they became aware of the events they cared about, and why they cared about those events. Data obtained from interviews were coded and analyzed. The findings of this study are summarized as the following. 1. The types of events undergraduates cared about were diverse, ranging from individual beliefs to environmental ecosystems. 2. The major dimensions undergraduates cared about were job/family, recreation/environment, and learning. Moreover, job-opportunity received the highest priority. 3. The time in which undergraduates began to become aware of their self-care-events varied at each academic stage. However, the freshman stage was a crucial time in which undergraduates become aware of their self-care-events. 4. The reasons why undergraduates cared about particular events varied, ranging from the nature of the event itself to its impact upon society. Specifically, individual factors were crucial, while family and school factors were minor. 5.

The research questionnaire was developed through literature reviews, a focus group of 11 counseling researchers, and a validation session with 10 college instructors who have taught at least one course in research methods or ethics. 102 college instructors in the counseling field completed the questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, t tests, and ANOVA were applied to examine the data. In addition, the opinions of participants were collected. The results showed that most participants held positive attitudes toward establishing research ethics codes. However, nearly 20% participants reported having difficulties following some of the research ethics guidelines, especially those regarding institutional approvals of research proposals and the procedural requirements of conducting experiments. Participants who had taught courses in both research methods and ethics reported more difficulties with implementation. The present study showed that even with strong support for having research ethics, some counseling researchers expressed hesitations and concerns about the ethics implementation regarding proposal approvals and requirements. This study highlights the importance of having easy-to-follow ethical requirements and procedures so that the ethics in counseling research are enhancement rather than become barriers that bring further complication.

Supervisees’ Perceptions of the Effectiveness of a Christian-based Spiritually Integrated Counseling Supervision Group,"Ping-Hwa Chen, Lan-Hsin Fan, Lin-Lin Cheng","Christian-based spiritually integrated counseling, group supervision","Spirituality has been increasing recognized as an important aspect of client diversity in counseling and psychotherapy. However, little attention has been given to spirituality in counseling supervision in the literature. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perceived effectiveness of a Christian-based spiritually integrated counseling supervision group. An experienced Christian counseling psychologist served as the supervisor and fifteen Christian counselors participated as supervisees. Three-hour group supervision sessions were held one or two times per month for six months. During each group session, one or two supervisees presented their cases, followed by group discussions. Individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted after the group supervision sessions to investigate supervisees’ perceptions of the effectiveness of the group supervision. Individual interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Eleven themes emerged from the data. Supervisees reported (1) enhanced spiritual perspectives and spiritual intervention competence, (2) enhanced counseling perspectives and counseling intervention competence, (3) clearer viewpoints for integrating spirituality into counseling, (4) enhanced sensitivities to clients’ specific spiritual issues, (5) stronger awareness of the relationship between their own spirituality and counseling work, (6) feelings of competence and effectiveness as spiritually integrated counselors, (7) concerns about the role of spiritually integrated counselors, (8) using spiritually integrated counseling in certain situations and contexts, (9) affirmation of the effectiveness of spiritual interventions, (10) experiencing challenges and confusion as a spiritually integrated counselor, and (11) perceptions of the charactevist: cs of the supervision group.

Beyond 4 Dimensions: The verification and analysis of the 6-dimensional goal orientation model,"Yen-Ying Lin, Biing-Lin Cherng","classroom goal structure, competitive model, goal orientation, test emotion","A 6-dimensional goal orientation model has been recently proposed with three types of references (i.e., task/self/other) and two focuses (i.e., approach/avoidance): task-approach, self-approach, other-approach, task-avoidance, self-avoidance, and other-avoidance. This study was an attempt to test a confirmatory factor analysis model of the 6-dimensional goal orientation theory by using structural equation modeling (SEM) and model comparison approach. Furthermore, the relationships of these goal orientations with classroom goal structures and test emotions were tested. The participants were 722 junior high school students. The theoretical model fitted the observed data well, supporting the 6-dimensional goal orientation theory. The results of this study also showed that the 6 goals were associated with classroom goal structures and test emotions. In terms of classroom goal structures, the approach mastery goal structure most strongly and positively predicted the task-approach goal and self-approach goal; the avoidance mastery goal structure most strongly and positively predicted the task-avoidance goal and self-avoidance goal; the approach performance goal structure most strongly and positively predicted the other-approach goal; and the avoidance performance goal structure most strongly and positively predicted the other-avoidance goal. In terms of test emotions, approach goals positively predicted the positive test emotions and negatively predicted the negative test emotions; conversely, avoidance goals negatively predicted the positive test emotions and positively predicted the negative test emotions.

The Analysis of How Clients Cope with Dependency Conflict in Relational Counseling Approaches,"Wan-Chen Chen, Yi-Ling Tsai, Huei-Huei Huang, Kuo-Ching Wu","coping, dependency conflict, in-depth counseling, relational approach","Purpose: From the psychologists’ perspective, this study delineated various responses and coping strategies clients had when they developed dependency conflict toward their psychologists through in-depth counseling relationships. Methods: We conducted interviews with 3 psychologists who adopted a relational approach to counseling and who primarily conducted long-term counseling. Each psychologist was interviewed twice; all interviews lasted for about an hour. The content analysis method was conducted by rereading and analyzing the narratives case by case, and repeatedly comparing the interview transcripts. Results: The data showed that clients’ needs for dependency were satisfied through being helped effectively. At the same time, they exhibited anxiety about depending on their psychologists due to the worry of re-enacting the painful experience of being rejected. Thus, how clients coped with their inner dependency conflict could be categorized into three types: “active strategies,” “passive strategies,” and “forming competitive relationships.” Conclusions: During in-depth counseling relationship, clients adopt different ways of coping to deal with inner dependency conflict. Though these coping strategies might bring certain pressures and threats to psychologists, the nature of clients’ resistance indicated that clients tried to regard psychologists as important others, and they intended to resolve their core inner conflicts while correcting their original emotional experience and interpersonal model. The whole process contributed significantly to clients’ overall change.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=195,46.1,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Examining the Phenomenon of Negative Attention Bias and Exploring the Effects of the Materials with Different Valence on Attention Bias Modification Training,"Yu-Quan Hu, Fa-Chung Chiu, Hsueh-Chih Chen","attention bias modification, negative attention bias, valence","Purpose：The purpose of the present study is to examine the assumption of biased attention toward negative stimuli and to explore the influence of the materials with differential negative valences on attention bias modification (ABM) training effect. Methods and Results：In Study 1, twenty-one participants’ eye movement were measured while showing paired stimuli which consisted of one negative picture and one neutral picture. Results supported the hypothesis that participants’ first gaze tended to be on the negative cues, and they maintained their gaze longer on the negative cues than the neutral cues. In Study 2, fifty-one participants were randomly allocated to the three groups: High negative valence group (the paired materials consisted of higher negative pictures and neutral pictures), low negative valence group (the paired materials consisted of lower negative pictures and neutral pictures), and negative group (the paired materials consisted of higher negative and lower negative pictures paired with neutral pictures). Each group was directed differential attentional responses to emotional stimuli accordingly by using a modified dot probe task (the high negative valence group and the low negative valence group were trained to develop the tendency to selectively orient attention away from negative information, and the control group was trained to develop the tendency to selectively orient attention toward negative information). The impact of attentional manipulation on subsequent attentional bias test and emotional vulnerability was examined. Results supported the hypothesis that the attentional bias modification procedure was effective in inducing attentional avoidance of negative information. Furthermore, this attentional manipulation served to reduce fear scores and to attenuate EMG responses to a subsequent horror movie. Moreover, increasing stimulus threat enhanced alert to negative stimuli, and participants’ first gaze to negative stimuli. Results suggested that higher negative materials paired with neutral materials provided greater effect of attention bias modification than lower negative materials. Conclusions：1. The results supported the hypothesis of attention bias; 2. The attentional bias modification procedure was effective in inducing attentional avoidance of negative information; 3. The attentional bias modification procedure served to reduce fear; 4. Higher negative materials paired with neutral materials provide greater effect of attention bias modification than lower negative materials.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=164,45.4,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Multi-samples structural equation model technique was used to investigate the differences between the middle-aged and older people in structural model coefficients. A convenience of sample of 640 participants, 45-95 years of age with a mean age of 61.05 was recruited in Taiwan. There were 296 participants with age 60 and above who were categorized into the older people group. The remaining 344 participants were categorized into the middle-aged group. In general, extraversion personality had significant positive effects on social support and SWB; neurotic personality had significant negative effects on social support and SWB; social support had significant positive effects on SWB. In contrast to the middle-aged people, older people’s social support had an increasing effect on SWB. Four structural paths were found to be non-significant, including the decreasing negative effects of neurotic personality on social support and SWB, the decreasing positive effect of extraversion personality on social support, and the increasing effect of extraversion personality on SWB.

Seven community counselor trainees provided services in the Typhoon Morakot disaster field in South Taiwan with the principal researcher August 11 to August 23, 2009. Data were gathered through participant observation, process notes, supervision discussion and focus group. Qualitative analysis indicated that when providing community counseling at the early phase of disaster management, service types and strategies changed according to the ethnic culture of victims, professional culture, and locations. Six themes of service strategies and content emerged from the data: (a) combining external business management and mental health interventions, (b) transforming passive attitude into active services, (c) diversifying strategies to adapt to diverse cultures, (d) adjusting professional attitudes to match the local cultural network; (e) co-constructing and transforming the disaster experiences, and (f) “mediating standardized service protocol and changing circumstances. Five themes concern collaborative challenges and strategies encountered by the team emerged: (a) dialectic of medical and holistic service models, (b) resolving conflicts among different professional modalities, (c) transforming standardized learning into service learning, (d) coping with power struggle within organizational stratum, and (e) putting victims’ needs above competitive service ecology.

Fifty-eight six- to twelve-months-old infants and their mothers participated. In the experimental procedure, half of the infants were assigned to a session where they experienced his/her mother first followed by a stranger, and the other half in a session with reverse encounter order. In each session, infants’ heart rates and crying behaviors were recorded in the baseline, cookie-offering, frustration induction, and recovery phases. Results found that infants cried more during frustration phase than cookie-offering phase. For the heart rates, a significant interaction was found between the avoidance and person who induced the frustration. Compared to infants with low-avoidance, infants with high avoidance tendency had more changes changed heart rates when facing strangers. A significant interaction between the avoidance and experimental phases was found. Follow-up analysis found that infants with high avoidance tendency had greater changes in their heart rates during frustration than infants with low avoidance. These findings suggested that in a mild frustration induction procedure, infants with high avoidance tendency exhibited greater changes in heart rates than those with low-avoidance in frustration, particularly in the stranger induced frustration.

However, earlier studies were limited to European languages. Not much is known about the process in Chinese language and even little about the developmental trajectories among Chinese readers. We investigate how the order of mention and gender semantic features may affect Chinese readers’ pronoun resolution and explore their development through a 3-way ANOVA mixed design. The effects of order of mention (first/second-mention) and gender semantic features (he/she) on pronoun resolution for 2nd to 5th graders were examined. A total of 206 participants participated. The results indicate that children in higher grades have higher rate of correct answer in pronoun resolution. Moreover, the higher the children’s grades, the less time they need to read sentence with pronouns. This pattern only appears, however, when the grade-groups are two or more years apart. In addition, the reading times of the first-mentioned were shorter than those of the second-mentioned when “he” referred to the first-mentioned protagonist for the 3rd graders; hence, first mention advantage is observed. Furthermore, for 2nd and 3rd graders, a recency effect appeared when children tried to resolve “she”. For 4th and 5th graders, their accuracy rates were usually above 90%, indicating that they have mastered the use of gender semantic features for this age, and there were no significant effects on order of mention or gender semantic features.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=170,45.4,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The feasibility of an obstetric psychological support project at a medical center,"Pey-Ling Shieh, Tsung-Ho Ying, Hsiao-Chun Chang, Ying-Chen Tseng","family-based, perinatal mental health, psychology professionals, psychology support project, qualitative paradigm","Perinatal mental health of women is an important issue that deserves attention. However, few psychological support projects have been adopted in obstetric units and few psychology professionals have been involved in such projects. The purpose of this study was to preliminarily explore the feasibility of an obstetric psychological support project led by psychology professionals. Based on a qualitative paradigm, a ten-week psychological support project was implemented at a medical center in Central Taiwan. Based on the principles of Listening Visit and parent-infant psychotherapy, strategies of nondirective counseling, observation, and interpretation were used in this project. Five psychology professionals (one professor, four undergraduates) and sixty-eight women participated in this project. Content analysis was conducted to analyze the psychology professionals’ process records. In the person, time, and space aspects, several factors that influenced the implementation of the project emerged. Those factors included: women’s physical wellbeing, the gender of interviewers, the pace during hospital stay, and the room environment. According to reactions of the participants, obstetric women showed different degrees of acceptance and involvement. For women, the most frequently raised psychosocial issues were postpartum living style, the way of “doing-the-month.” emotions, child-rearing problems, and relationships with partner and mother-in-law. Chaotic states of life and child-rearing challenges were psychosocial issues that husbands were concerned with. As for the obstetric women’s family of origin, they were most concerned about whether their daughters were appropriately taken cared of. For the mothers-in-law, they have mixed feelings about the ways for which “doing-the-month” were carried out. Based on the results, we suggest an early implementation of educational programs of the psychological support project for pregnant women and their families. We also address the importance of the structured, family-based counseling approach, further training for psychology professionals, and their collaboration with medical staffs. The development of measures to assess perinatal mental health and the outcome of psychological support project are needed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=198,45.3,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Prediction of Romantic Attachment from Family Differentiation and Family Violence,Sung-Hsien Sun,"family differentiation, family violence, romantic attachment","This research study explores the association between attachment in a romantic relationship and past familial emotional experiences. Familial emotional experiences included family differentiation and family violence; and family differentiation included the experience of affective involvement and intrusiveness. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was adopted. In addition, the different relationships between father and son, mother and son, and perceived parents were explored separately, and gender differences were also compared through regression analysis. The research sample included 480 participants (168 males and 312 females) who were in a relationship at that time. The research results yielded three conclusions: (1) overall, offspring-parent violence best predicted anxiety attachment in a romantic relationship, however the predictive power was low and varied by gender; (2) in general, perceived parents affective involvement best predicted avoidance attachment in a relationship; (3) for men, affective involvement on the part of perceived parents best predicted avoidance attachment in a relationship with low to medium levels of predictive power. Generally speaking, the fewer violent experiences in an offspring-parent relationship, the less anxiety attachment an individual would likely experience in a romantic relationship. Also, the more emotional connections between perceived parents, the less avoidance attachment an individual would likely have. In closing, the paper included additional discussions and addressed research limitations.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=199,45.3,2014,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

An Existential-Phenomenological Study on the Transitional Experience of Suffering: Dialogues between Existential Phenomenology and Theories of Counseling and Psychotherapy,"Yi-Jen Lu, Shu-Hui Liu","counseling and psychotherapy, existential phenomenology, phenomenological psychology , transitional process of suffering","The human experience of suffering and the process of change have always been core issues in counseling and psychotherapy. This article reviewed theories of counseling and psychotherapy to address the paradox of each theory, and then explored the transitional experience of suffering from the perspectives of existential phenomenology. Based on such understanding, the experience-based connecting points in various theories were found. This study used an existential-phenomenology approach to carry out interviews with three interviewees under suffering. The second interview was conducted one and a half years after the first one; the third one was a half year after the second one. The three interviews expanded over two years, and was used to analyze the interviewees’ transitional experience of suffering. The results showed that: (1) sufferers used bodies and emotions as tools to reflect upon the feasibility of their original projects and worldviews; (2) the key to sufferers’ transitional experience included “revising” their original project, and “accepting” of the world considered a threat by them which are viewed as a learning process; (3) during the learning process, sufferers identified the paradox between past and present experience through psychological and embodied pain, and then started to find the solution. The learning process involved: (a) wishing to solve the problems; (b) re-understanding and accepting their past; (c) trying to solve the conflicts between the past and the present; (d) after the painful learning process, new situation or new possibility for sufferers appeared. This study discussed the existing descriptions of existential phenomenology on transitional experience of suffering from the viewpoint of counseling and psychotherapy, and made suggestions for counseling practitioners and future research.

Each student was assigned to one of quartile group based on his science performance. For each group, gender differences in central tendency, standard deviation, and numbers were examined. The results indicate that gender differences are generally small. However, the scores of male consistently have larger variances. Most of gender differences in mean, standard deviation ratio, and ratio of the male numbers to the female numbers from groups below Q1 and above Q3 are significant. Female outperforms male in group below Q1, while male outperforms female among high-scoring group. In those two groups, the scores of male have larger variance. Males outnumber females substantially among high performing group. The results of gender difference pattern from TIMSS and PISA are inconsistent.

Phonological awareness was measured by deletion tests in both Chinese and English. Morphological awareness of English was measured by compound construction and derivational morphology; morphological awareness of Chinese was measured by homophone sensitivity and compound construction. The results showed that among predictors of each language, Chinese phonological awareness was associated with Chinese character reading, but its significance disappeared after controlling for morphological awareness of Chinese. However, morphological awareness of Chinese made a significant unique contribution to Chinese character reading after taking phonological awareness of Chinese into account. Similar patterns of results were obtained in predicting English word reading, where morphological awareness of English, rather than phonological awareness, was the unique predictor of English word reading. Across languages, awareness of English derivational morphology predicted unique variance in Chinese character reading over and above phonological and morphological awareness of Chinese. These results suggested additionally involving awareness of English derivational morphology can better predict Chinese character reading than involving Chinese measures alone.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=206,45.2,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

This study also examined the relationship between speech perception abilities and word comprehension in childhood. 150 Mandarin-speaking 4-8 year-old children (30 for each age group) participated in AX phonetic discrimination tasks constructed by three phonetic contrasts with different speech acoustic features (i.e., stops with different articulation places, affricate vs. fricative, lexical tone 2 vs. 3) . The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT) was used to assess children’s word comprehension ability. The results that older children performed better speech discrimination and perceptual sensitivity than the younger ones on all three phonetic discrimination tasks indicated the progress of speech perception abilities during 4-8 years of age. In examining the phonetic contrast effects on the speech perception abilities, the results showed that children performed better on the lexical tone sensitivities than the affricate vs. fricative discrimination. In addition, the phonetic discrimination performance was positively correlated with the PPVT score, and the regression model showed that both lexical tone and stop consonant sensitivity contributed to the variance of PPVT scores, especially the lexical tone sensitivity contribute to word comprehension more than the stop consonant sensitivity. These results showed the improving sensitivity in discriminating native phonetic contrasts in 4-8 year-old children, and suggested that speech perception plays an essential role in word comprehension development in Mandarin-speaking children.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=207,45.2,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The purpose was to employ the IRT models under the multivariate ability distribution in order to investigate the composite scores with the consideration that correlations existed among the examinees’ proficiencies. This research followed Kolen, Wang, and Lee’s (2012) method for the development of the IRT-based procedure. The five tests of the Basic Competence Test were used, with a random sample of 5,000 examinees obtained in 2008. The analyses included the descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of the composite scores, overall SEM and reliability values, as well as the CSEMs. The findings indicated that there existed strong relationships between pairs of the proficiencies of the five tests and the results of Kolen et al.’s modeling were satisfied. For large-scale testing programs that rely on two or more tests to make high-stakes decisions, the issue of combining individual scores into a single total score is critical. Through the employment of Kolen et al.’s model for deriving the composite scores under the multivariate distribution, and along with this research utilizing the real data, the results of this study have revealed more of the psychometric features of the composite scores and have also helped lay a more solid foundation for many studies to embark on the estimation of examinees’ ability levels in the multivariate proficiency setting via IRT.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=209,45.2,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

"Right Moods, Right Creativities: Differential Effects of Emotional States on Divergent Thinking and Insight Problem Solving","Ping-Hsun Tsai, Wei-Lun Lin, Hung-Yu Lin","arousal, creativity, divergent thinking, emotional states, insight problem","Previous studies investigating the relationships between emotional state and creativity reveal inconsistent and inconclusive results. Some found that positive emotional state enhanced creativity performance; some supported the facilitative effect of negative emotions; while others showed that positive and negative emotional states can both improve creativity. These inconsistencies might be attributed to the problems that the lack of differentiation between levels of emotional states and no distinction is made between different types of creativity tasks in the previous studies. According to achievement motivation theory, optimal arousal level is a U-shaped function of the nature of performance task, and different tasks require different levels of arousal for optimal performance. Past research also indicated that different creativity tasks, says, open-ended divergent thinking and closed-ended insight problem solving, involved distinct processes. In the present study, 200 participants were randomly assigned to five emotional manipulation conditions – high degree of positive emotion, medium degree of positive emotion, neutral, medium degree of negative emotion, and high degree of negative emotion. Half of the participants in each condition performed divergent thinking test, while the other half performed insight problem-solving task. The Results showed that different emotional states have different effects on the two creativity measures. While medium positive emotional state can mostly improve insight problem solving, divergent thinking performance is positively related to the degree of arousal-regardless of positive or negative valence, – the higher the emotional arousal, the more enhanced the performance. These Results help to clarify the relationships between emotion and creativity. Results also establish the basis to explore the mechanism by which emotions influence creativity and the means by which creativity can be enhanced.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=211,45.1,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The obtained data was analyzed by MANOVA, Pearson´s product-moment correlation, and canonical analysis. The main findings were as follows: (1) There was a significant gender difference on parentification, with men scoring significantly higher on “unfairness” than women. There was also a significant birth order difference on parentification, with oldest children scoring significantly higher than youngest children on “instrumental care-giving”. (2) Canonical analysis revealed one significant correlation between canonical variate of parentification and health. Less instrumental care-giving, more emotional care-giving and more unfair treatments were associated with worse health. (3) Parentification was significantly correlated with individuation. We found two significant correlations between canonical variates of parentification and individuation. The first one showed that more unfairness was associated with more functional independence, more attitudinal independence, more emotional independence, but less confliction of independence. In the second one, more emotional caring for the family was associated with lower individuation. Finally, based on the results of this study, we discussed suggestions for future research and implications for counseling and parent education.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=215,45.1,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"The Reliability and Validity of the The Chinese Version of the Nonattachment Scale: Reliability, validity, and Its Relationship with Mental Health","Shu-He Chao, Ping-Hwa Chen","anxiety, nonattachment, perceived stress evaluation, subjective well-being, zhong-yong thinking style","Recently, a scale was developed to measure the Buddhist notion of “nonattachment,” which means “release from mental ﬁxations” (Sahdra, Shaver, & Brown, 2010, p.116). We investigated the validity and reliability of the Chinese version of the Nonattachment Scale and explored its relationship with a variety of psychological constructs in Taiwan. We administered to a total of 313 military soldiers a package of scales. The results showed that the Chinese version of the Nonattachment Scale reached acceptable levels of reliability and validity. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that nonattachment was related but distinguishable from the Chinese construct of zhong-yong thinking style. Nonattachment was positively correlated with the majority of the positive constructs, including subjective well-being and self-determination, and was negatively correlated with negative constructs, including state-trait anxiety and perceived stress evaluation. The implications of how nonattachment and its measurement may contribute to counseling practice were discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=216,45.1,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Analysis of Medical Students’ Ethical Experience in Their Clerkship: The Application of Structured Critical Incident Report,"Gin-Hong Lee, Chih-Chia Wang, Kuo-Inn Tsou, Hou-Chang Chiu, Ming-Teh Lin","clinical clerkship, critical incident report, ethical dilemma, medical student","Background: In the past, teachers used to ask medical students to reflect on their clinical experience through free-form writing. In this study, a structured form called “Critical Incident Report” was implemented. Through systematic and multi-dimensional writing, better understanding of students’ psychological and cognitive reactions toward clinical ethical problems could be expected. Methods: Twenty-six medical school students who were taking the compulsory course “Medical Ethics” participated in the current study. Seventeen of them were males and 9 of them were females. Participants were asked to each complete a Critical Incident Report (CIR) (Griffin, 2003) on an ethically sensitive event they had found unforgettable during their practicum in their 5th year of medical school. The CIR contained eight columns: what, emotions, why, classification, general meaning, professional standards, position, and actions. The data obtained from the CIR written by these 26 students with consent was subjected to a qualitative analysis. Both the experts’ and the students’ classification of the events on their CIRs were compared to ethical principles listed by medical ethics experts according to each student’s event report. Results: 1. There was a significant difference between the medical students and the experts in the ethical principles they categorized the events into. 2. The most remarkable ethically sensitive events and conflicts experienced by the students were most frequently related to “non-maleficence” and “autonomy”. 3. Beliefs that students held toward ethically sensitive events included patient-centered practice, professionalism, and holistic health care. 4. Students’ emotions about the events included confusion and sympathy toward patients, and negative feelings such as anger, disapproval or disappointment toward clinical physicians. 5. When faced with ethical dilemmas, students usually adopted “communication” as the primary strategy. Conclusion: Medical students’ experience with medical ethics in the clinical setting involved a broad range of issues including cognition, personal beliefs, emotions, and intentional actions. The CIR helped students record and present these experiences, which could also serve as a reference for future improvement of medical ethics education and research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=219,44.4,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

A total of 27 Christian counselors, 3 males and 24 females, participated in the study. The course included three goals which were to enhance the awareness of spiritual development, to increase the knowledge of spiritual issues, and to enhance the intervention skills of integrating spiritual issues into counseling. In order to reach the goals, 11 themes were included in the 39-hour course. To explore the reactions of the participants toward the course, feedback sheets were designed and distributed at the end of each session. Twelve focused groups were also conducted at three different time points. Positive reactions were indicated from the feedback sheets and focused groups. Participants were benefited from having open dialogues, exchanging diverse perspectives, validating each other’s point of view, generating and clarifying new thoughts, obtaining consensus, and integrating spirituality into counseling. Suggestions were made by participants to include more discussions, concrete implementation and skill training, case discussions, and roleplays.

The Effects of Using Graphic Organizers in Reducing  Seductive-Details Effect,"Hui-Chan Tsai, Huei-Min Wu","graphic organizers, seductive details effect","Previous studies have reported that the inclusion of interesting details that are related but not directly relevant to the learning material (i.e. seductive details) was often at the expense of learning important or target material. The major purposes of the present study were to examine whether the use of graphic organizer (GO) would eliminate the seductive details effects and whether the inclusion of seductive details (SD) had a positive effect on students’ learning interest and learning time. The participants were 207 fourth grade students. The target learning material was a passage (T) about insects. The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: (a) watched a video, and then read the target material (SD+T), (b) viewed a graphic organizer, and then watched a video followed by reading the target material (SD+GO+T), (c) watched a video, and then read the target material followed by viewing a graphic organizer (SD+T+GO), (d) viewed a graphic organizer followed by reading the target material (GO+T), (e) read the target material followed by viewing a graphic organizer (T+GO), or (f) only read the target material (Control). After reading the passage, students completed a learning interest scale and a quiz. The major findings are as follows: First, the present study supported the seductive details effect (i.e. including interesting but not directly relevant details hindered learners’ reading comprehension). Second, the inclusion of graphic organizers mitigated but did not eliminate the seductive-details effect. Third, providing seductive details had no significant effect on learning interest. Finally, the inclusion of seductive details led to less time committed to read the target material.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=171,44.4,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Is internet addiction a mental disorder? A review of empirical and conceptual studies,"Shao-Ling Hsu, Hsiang-Ju Shih","compulsive internet use, internet addiction, mental disorder, problematic internet use, psychic retreat","This paper aimed to sort out how researchers’ view of the internet addiction phenomenon evolved by providing an integrated review of the related empirical and conceptual studies. We found there was a transition from a pathological disease perspective to a non-pathological adaptation perspective. On the one hand, the view point about internet addition’s essence of disease was moving from substance abuse to the impulsive control disorder which is supported by majority of researches; on the other hand, due to the researches on comorbidity, whether internet addiction is a solitary disorder or not needs to be further examined. Besides, other non-pathological assumptions were discussed in this paper. “Problematic internet use” is becoming the popular term as multidimensional and continuum spectrum perspectives toward IAD were sprouted in related references. Therefore, we recommend that future researchers exam the internet addiction phenomenon with broader perspectives taking into account the users and using conditions to figure out its various appearances and characteristics. For clinical practice, we recommend counselors to understand clients with an open mind and to explore their meaning of internet use at the inner psychological level.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=217,44.4,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Confirmation of the Connotation of Same-Sex Friendship Quality and Analysis of the Gender Differences among University Students,"Mei-Ru Chao, Shyh-Yih Wang","friendship quality, gender difference, same-sex friendship","Friendship is the most respectful relationship among social relations. According to Erikson’s conceptual theory, an individual’s life mission develops until the adolescent age. University students are at the stage of constructing the relationships among people’s ""intimacy vs. isolation"". If friendships are such important aspects of one’s life, what are the friendship qualities for Taiwanese university students? Are there gender differences in friendships? Most of the studies have shown that girls are interested in the social situations and respect each other’s intimate sharing and feelings more than boys and; boys focus more on social tools and are more actively engaged in specific activities. The goal of this study is to confirm the connotation of same-sex friendship quality and analyze gender differences based on 463 university students in Taiwan. The results indicated: (1) The connotation of same-sex friendship quality includes genuineness, personal loyalty, tacit understanding, and support. (2) Except personal loyalty, female students show higher agreement on the connotation of the same-sex friendship quality, such as genuineness, tacit understanding, and support, than male students. (3) In terms of the importance of these same-sex friendship qualities, for male students, the order is as follows: genuineness, support, personal loyalty, and tacit understanding. For female students, the order is support, genuineness, personal loyalty, and tacit understanding. Across both genders, genuineness and support are the most emphasized same-sex friendship qualities, and tacit understanding is the least emphasized one among the four same-sex friendship qualities. Based on the research results, Taiwanese university students’ same-sex friendship values have interesting differences compared with studies from other countries.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=220,44.4,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
"Text Coherence, Reading Ability, and Children’s Scientific Understanding",Chi-Shun Lien,"reading ability, reading comprehension, text coherence","The purposes of this study were (1) to examine whether principles of revision that improve the coherence of text, which have been used successfully on texts for advanced readers, can also be used in revising young readers’ texts; (2) to investigate whether the principles used to revise history texts can be applied to scientific texts and (3) to look at the interaction between text coherence and reading ability. Two authentic scientific texts (on diabetes and on pain) were revised according to four revision principles, providing argument-overlap, making implicit concepts explicit, changing order of sentences and paragraphs, and adding macro-structure to the text. Ninety-one 6th-grade students were divided into low-ability and high-ability groups and randomly assigned to read either the original texts or the revised texts. Participants’ comprehension was measured by free recall, questions assessing knowledge of the textbase (which assessed a shallow level of comprehension), and inference questions (which assessed a deep level of comprehension). Results indicated that young readers’ comprehension was superior when the coherent version of the texts was read. High-ability readers performed better than low-ability readers. A significant interaction between text coherence and reading ability emerged on the inference questions for one of the texts. That is, low-ability readers’ performance on the inference questions was better when the text was coherent, whereas high ability readers’ performance was not improved by making the text coherent. Thus the text coherence affected the deep comprehension level of these low-ability readers.

Examining an Experimental Emotional Training Course for Junior High School Students,"Wan-E Lo, Ming-Feng Guu, Wen-Chih Tseng)","emotional education, junior high school students, life adjustment, positive emotion","Emotional disturbances have become a serious problem among adolescents in recent years. Negative emotional patterns generated by negative experiences influence various aspects of the youths’ life. In this study, we developed a six-week experimental course using techniques to enhance positive emotions and then measured its effectiveness in improving the emotional intelligence and life-skills of junior high school students. Participants were 144 ninth-grade students at a junior high school in Taoyuan County, Taiwan. They were divided into an experimental group and a control group with pre- and post-tests administered, along with a follow-up test. The effectiveness of the course was evaluated through measures of life adaptability and positive/negative emotions.The students in the experimental group participated in a six-week positive-emotion course, while those in the control group participated in a course with integrated common activities. Students in the experimental group had higher scores on the life-adaptability post-test than did students in the control group. This pattern of results was similar for the follow-up test three weeks after the conclusion of the courses. However, no significant difference was found on positive emotions measured by the positive/negative emotional scale. Yet, in both the post- and follow-up tests, those in the experimental group had higher scores on emotional balance (positive emotions minus negative emotions). This paper concludes with a discussion of the value this emotional training course has in contemporary education, and offers suggestions for future research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=224,44.3,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

To advance the understanding of the root causes and to help students confront challenges, we examined the negative relationship and mechanism between the fear of being laughed at (gelotophobia) and challenge-confronting tendencies. We also explored whether the incremental view of ability held by students would help them confront challenges and buffer the negative effect. The results of this study with 308 junior high school students were : (1) The fear of being laughed at actually exerted negative influences on all the three dimensions of the challenge-confronting tendencies, which included value belief, general accepting and seeking tendency, and public accepting tendency. (2) Fear of failure partially mediated the negative effect of gelotophobia on the public accepting tendency dimension, but did not show mediating effects in the other two dimensions. (3) Incremental view of ability increased students’ challenge-confronting tendencies in all the three dimensions. (4) Relative to entity view of ability, incremental view of ability did not buffer the negative effect of gelotophobia on challenge-confronting tendencies, but instead intensified the negative effect.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=228,44.3,2013,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Applying of Fuzzy Statistics in Item Difficulty,"Ming-chuan Hsieh, Ber-lin Wu","assessment for test difficulty, fuzzy relative weight, fuzzy statistics","The traditional method of using the Likert scale in questionnaires provides researchers with information of fixed scale choices, which does not allow participants fully express their candid and complex thinking. The current paper applies fuzzy statistics to examine item difficulty of questionnaires. Concepts such as fuzzy mean, fuzzy mode or fuzzy median are applied. Based on the conceptions of fuzzy statistics, we try to define a new distance, which was transformed to obtain an item difficulty index that allows the comparisons between test items. Another focus of this paper is to determine the difficulty level of test items by examining various dimensions of difficulty factors. The weights of the dimensions of the item difficulty were compared and analyzed with the concept of fuzzy relative weight.

Holland´s simple circular and calculus hypotheses as well as Gati’s hierarchical model and two-group partition model were tested. Data from 10,626 Taiwanese high school students were randomly divided into two samples, (Sample A and Sample B). Factor analysis on sample A revealed a six-factor structure consistent with the RIASEC types. Sample B was used to vigorously test Holland’s hypotheses and Gati’s models. Holland’s simple circular hypothesis and the calculus hypothesis were supported by multidimensional scaling and randomization test, respectively. Gati’s hierarchical model was supported by factor analysis and hierarchical clustering on six interest type scores. Also, Gait’s three-group partition model (RI, AS, EC) as well as a two-group partition model (RI, ASEC) were found by factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, hierarchical clustering, and randomization test. Research findings reported by Ou (2011) were used to examine the practical usefulness of the partition models. It was suggested that the two-group partition model might be more useful for career counseling among high school students in Taiwan than the three-group partition model. A survey suggested that the structure of the vocational interests perceived by high school counselors were similar to those found in the analyses, supporting Holland’s hypotheses and Gati’s models.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=245,44.1,2012,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Practical Strategies of Social Workers as Student Guidance in Secondary Schools,Chung-Yi Hu,"practical strategies, school social work, student guidance.","The purpose of this study was to explore practical strategies that social workers used in student guidance in secondary school. In-depth interviews were conducted to collect data from 12 school social workers. Two types of strategies were found: Direct strategies (education, intervention, and mediation) and indirect strategies (consultation, cooperation, and advocacy). And two targets of treatment were found: the individuals and their ecological systems (family, school, and community). Thus, school social workers provided professional service with both individual and ecological targets, and also used several strategies which were different from counseling and education. Lastly, several suggestions were recommended for future practice: (1) division and cooperation of multi-professional practitioners; (2) working from an ecological system perspective with multi-strategies.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=252,43.4,2012,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

One hundred and forty-seven college students were randomly assigned to 3 (feedback type) × 2 (problem presentation) experimental conditions to solve three problems for three times. The results showed that when word problems were presented with graphic representational cues, the time would decrease significantly and the accuracy increased. Repetitive practice alone did not improve the performance. In addition, only when practice was augmented with diagnostic feedback would the accuracy rate increase and efforts to solve the same problem repetitively be sustained, but such effects would be significant only after two rounds of practice. The effects of confirmatory feedback on problem-solving were similar to the control group in that it speeded up problem-solving, but there was little improvement in accuracy across practices. Analyses of 71 participants’ problem-solving protocols according to a two-space four-stage model showed that diagnostic feedback would direct participants’ cognitive activities to problem comprehension and problem definition, while confirmatory feedback would induce participants to put more efforts in computational analyses. This pattern of findings suggests that in solving ill-defined problems, numerical analysis is conducted only when the problem has been clearly defined.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=253,43.4,2012,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Suppression of Emotional Expression in Interpersonal Context,Wen-Tzu Chiang,"emotion expression, emotion regulation, expressive suppression, interpersonal context","Researchers and practitioners alike have noted that emotion suppression has been associated with poor psychological and physical health, and negative social consequences. Nevertheless, Chinese culture encourages emotional suppression in circumstances where there is in an effort to preserve relationships. Harmonious social relationships are of utmost importance in Chinese culture, forbearance has been considered as a common and valued emotional regulation strategy in interpersonal conflicts. This study attempted to understand why people suppress their emotion expression. The scope focused on college students’ interpersonal context. A qualitative approach using semi-structured interview and emotion journal was applied to get data. In addition to analyzing 22 emotional journals, there were 24 undergraduates participated to interview. Results showed there were many reasons for suppressing the negative emotions, including maintaining harmonious relations, avoiding the negative consequence of expression, controlling impulse rationally, adhering to ethical etiquette, emotion expression is useless, and poor in emotional expression. The suppression of positive emotion expression were due to avoiding show off too much, worrying about others’ jealousy, considering the feelings of others, and being not used to express. In addition, whether people express emotions or suppress them, depends on the communal relationship and immediate situation. The stronger the relationship, the more possible to express the emotions. In many contexts, expressive suppression appears to be a risk form of emotion regulation, but in some of contexts, the outcome may well be worthwhile to take the risk. In light of these analysis, this study suggest that, in Chinese culture, the critical question becomes not whether it is generally better to express or suppress emotion, but when, where, and with whom it is advantageous to suppress rather than express one’s emotions.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1698,43.3,2012,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Adopting scenario experimental method, this study manipulated the variables of “threat of successful event” and “closeness to the interacting target” in an achievement of horizontal distinctiveness. The dependent variables were participants’ choice of attributional reason and motivation, in addition, their modesty scores were measured as well. The results of χ 2 analyses showed that when the success was a threat to the interacting target, participants would attribute their success to “luck” with a motivation of “empathy”. When the achievement was not a threat, participants would attribute their success to “effort” and “ability” with intimates with a motivation of “sharing glory”, but to ”luck” with acquaintances with motivation of “obeying social modest norm”.

Teachers learned to integrate instruction and assessment in a lesson in which they examined students’ learning progress by questioning and then gave students immediate feedback accordingly to push students learning forward. In addition, this study examined whether or not students’ learning achievement in mathematics benefits from the improvement of teachers’ instruction. The researchers applied Mehan’s (1979) theoretical framework to analyze teacher-student discourse in mathematics classrooms and to inspect the progress of participating teachers’ questioning/feedback. Students’ mathematics learning achievement in the treatment group was compared with that of students in the control group in terms of one-way ANOVA. Results suggested that: (1) In the beginning, the participating teachers tended to use low-level questions to conduct teacher-students discourse and did not allow students enough time to answer the questions; (2) While the teacher professional learning community was operated in terms of a three-stages and cyclic model, teachers’ formative assessment practice was improved effectively. Participating teachers began to probe and to clarify students thinking by posing high-level questions with an aim to guide students learning step-by-step; (3) Students’ mathematics learning achievement benefited from the development of their teacher’s teaching. This study also reported the influence of the learning community on the participating teachers’ personal professional learning and provided suggestions for teacher instruction as well as suggestions for subsequent studies.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1701,43.3,2012,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Based on mathematical structures and the theory of reasoning with organization (Duval, 1998), two versions (i.e., segmented and nonsegmented) of a print-based geometric proof were created. Forty-nine experts (i.e., 28 pre-service and 21 in-service math teachers) and sixty-six novices in their eighth-grade year were randomly assigned to either a segmented or non-segmented group. Results showed that for both experts and novices, segmentation helped increase their reading willingness and to lower their perceived task difficulty and cognitive demandingness of task. Segmenting or not, however, would not make a statistical difference with respect to participants’ reading comprehension. Additionally, irrespective of versions of text read, experts’ reading willingness and confidence level were significantly higher than those of the novices. Experts’ perceived task difficulty and cognitive demandingness of task were significantly lower than those of the novices.

"Examining the Relationships among Chidlren´s Emotional Security, Parent Marital Conflict Coping, and Undermining of Parenting Alliance of Elementary School Students",Huey-Ya Lin,": coping strategies for marital conflict, emotional security pattern, parental relationship, parenting alliance","The aims of the present study were to identify children’s emotional security patterns and to examine its relationships with parents’ marital conflict coping strategies, and u ndermining of parenting alliance. Participants were 398 families, including 5th and 6th graders and their parents. Results indicated that children’s emotional security patterns could be identified as “security pattern,” “preoccupied pattern,” and “dismissing pattern.” Fathers with children in “security pattern” reported higher level of “positive reaction” strategy when coping with marital conflict. Fathers with children in “preoccupied pattern” reported highest level of “argument” strategy and highest level of undermining of parenting alliance whereas fathers with children in “security pattern” reported lowest levels of these two aspects. Fathers with children in “preoccupied pattern” and in “dismissing pattern” reported high levels of “self-blamed,” “escaping from conflict,” and “self-interested” strategies; however, there was no significant differences between fathers with children in these two patterns. Mothers with children in “security pattern” reported higher level of “positive reaction” strategy whereas mothers with children in “preoccupied pattern” reported lowest level of this strategy. Mothers with children in “preoccupied pattern” reported highest levels of “argument” and “self-blamed” strategies and undermining of parenting alliance, and mothers with children in “security pattern” reported lowest levels of these two strategies. Moreover, mothers with children in “preoccupied pattern” reported highest level of “escaping from conflict,” and mothers with children in “security pattern” reported lowest level of “self-blamed” strategies.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1712,43.2,2011,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Effects of Regulatory Focus and Expectancy to Success on Creativity and Critical Thinking,"Hsu-Chung Chang, Fa-Chung Chiu, Hsueh-Chih Chen, Chih-Chun Hsu","creativity, critical thinking, expectancy to success, prevention focus, promotion focus","The purposes of this study were to explore the effect of regulatory focus on creativity and critical thinking, and whether the expectancy to success moderates the relationship between the regulatory focus and creativity and critical thinking. In experiment 1, participants (N = 58) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions. To manipulate the promotion, prevention, and neutral conditions, participants in the promotion focus condition were asked to complete imaginative aggressive task, and participants in the prevention focus condition were asked to complete imaginative defensive task, and participants in the neutral condition were asked to read psychological article and then writing it out. After completing the respective task, participants in all conditions filled out the Remote Association Test and Critical Thinking Test. Results indicated that promotion focus motivation priming can promote creative thinking, while prevention focus motivation can promote critical thinking. In experiment 2A, participants (N = 72) were randomly assigned to “promotion and high expectancy,” “promotion and low expectancy,” “prevention and high expectancy,”“prevention and low expectancy,” and control conditions. Under the promotion focus condition, high expectancy group scored higher on creativity than low expectancy group. In experiment 2B, participants (N = 72) were randomly assigned to the same 5 conditions as in 2A; however, the method of inducing regulatory focus was the same as that in Experiment 1. Results show that under the prevention focus condition , the critical thinking performance of the low expectancy is higher than the high expectancy, and under the low expectancy, the prevention focus is higher than promotion focus. In sum, promotion focus motivation priming can promote creative thinking, whereas the prevention focus motivation can promote critical thinking. In addition, the expectancy to success moderates the relationship between the regulatory focus and creativity and critical thinking.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1716,43.2,2011,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Effects of Scaffolding Concept Mapping Instructional Strategies on Children’s Biological,"Yu-Sheng Wu, Yuhtsuen Tzeng","affection, concept mapping, instructional strategy, reading representation, scaffolding","Proven to be a useful leaning strategy, concept mapping remains as a challenging skill for students to learn. A key instructional issue is to reduce the difficulty of learning of the strategy. In this study, we incorporated principles of the scaffolding theory in the process of teaching concept mapping strategy with manipulated support of learning the strategy of concept mapping to seek evidence for effectiveness of the manipulation. A 4 x 2 quasi-experimental design of the study with the independent variables of manipulation of the scaffolding support (concept-map drawing, concept-map reading, scaffold-fading, and control groups) and prior knowledge (high versus low background knowledge) was adopted. Participants were 138 5th grade students recruited from 4 different classes. A pre-test on biological science knowledge was administered followed by a 12-week instruction. A post-test and a questionnaire were given to assess the effectiveness of the scaffolding on student learning and their attitude toward the instruction. The results indicated that (a) all experimental groups score higher than control group on text-based representation of knowledge (?) and no differences among experimental groups; (b)For situation model representation, scaffold-fading group score the highest, followed by the concept-map drawing and the concept-map reading and the control groups, with no significant difference between the last two groups; (c) Students with high prior knowledge scored more highly than those with low prior knowledge on both text-based and situation model representation; (d) There was no interaction between teaching strategy and background knowledge; and (e) Scaffold-fading group enjoyed more learning concept mapping and indicated they were more likely to use this strategy in the future. Analysis of their drawing protocol revealed that providing proper scaffolding did make it easy for students to learn relationships between conceptual nodes.

A Case Study on ParentalDiscourse Strategies and a Bilingual Child’s Code-Mixing,"Ching-Ju Li, Pang-Chieh Lin, Hui-Lan Hsiu","case study, code-mixing, parental discourse strategies, simultaneous bilingual children, Taiwan","The case study was conducted to examine the relationship between parental discourse strategies and the mixed-coding of language behavior of a 2-year-old Mandarin-English bilingual girl in interactions between the parents and the child. The parents were non-English native speakers and adopted the “one-person one-language” practice in the family, where the father spoke Chinese to the daughter and allowed the daughter to respond in either Chinese or English, while the mother used only English in the interaction with the daughter. Monthly recordings of the child’s naturalistic interactions with both parents over one year revealed that the father was more tolerant of the child’s mixed coding, and the mother was intolerant. The child used mixed Mandarin and English in interactions with her father frequently, but less frequently used the mixed coding with her mother. A series of correlation analyses shows that parents’ discourse strategies in response to the child’s mixed coding of language are positively and significantly correlated with the child’s overall rates of using mixed-coding and the likelihood that the mixed-coding was used in the next round of conversation. It seems the child differentiated pragmatic strategies in her interactions with respective parents. She recognized the one-person-one-language rule in her interactions with her mother and eventually appliedit in her interactions with her father.

IRT prescribes an item characteristic curve that provides the probability of an examinee correctly answering an item with a parameter of a given ability level. Examiners can develop various tests for different purposes based on a chosen item response model. However, in actual testing practice, the priori item response model is often unknown. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of model misspecification on computerized testing. Using norm-referenced testing, results indicated that model misspecification has an effect on the estimate of examinees’ abilities. Both the RMSE and test length significantly increased when the wrong item response models were used, especially when item bank belongs to three-parameter logistic model. In criterion-referenced testing, model misspecification has no effect on the accuracy of classification.

Data from the second to the eighth sessions were gathered at the conclusion of each counseling session using the “Self-Disclosure Questionnaire(SDQ)”. Results indicated that: (1) at the initial phase (sessions 2 to 4),willingness to self-disclose is due to “Positive Relation” factor, and unwillingness to self –disclose is due to “uncertainty about self” and “self-deprecation” factors. (2) at the middle phase (sessions 5 to 7), willingness to self-disclose is related to similar factors as those in the initial phase, although the weights of “Positive Relationship” and “Break the Silence” factors slightly decreased; for unwillingness to self-disclose, the weights of the “Self Uncertainty” and “Self-Deprecation” factors slightly decreased, but the weights of “Personal Pace” and “Feeling Uncomfortable” slightly increased. (3) At the latter phase (sessions 8 to 10), willingness to self-disclose factors and their relative weights were about the same as that in the initial and middle phases; for unwillingness to self disclose, the factors of “Uncertainty” and “Self-Deprecation” factors were lower than that in the middle phase, and the factors of “Self-Deprecation,” “Lack of Trust,” “Personal Pace,” and “Feeling Uncomfortable” approached zero.

To devise successful science education, it is necessary to consider both scientific knowledge and scientific thinking. The crucial point of scientific thinking is to achieve global coherence in thinking instead of local coherence which involves conflicts in thinking. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of science education on diluting superstitious thinking in terms of local coherence in thinking. Three experiments were designed to investigate the coherence in thinking of elementary school, middle/high school, and college students in the fields of physiognomy, supernaturalism, and geomancy, respectively. In each experiment, two stories depicting the same unusual events with conflicting paranormal explanations were presented. The participants were asked to rate their acceptance of each explanation in a five point scale. Similar results were found in the three experiments: (1) Participants’ acceptance of paranormal explanations decreases with age; (2) However, the correlation between participants’ two responses to the two conflicting explanations suggests local coherence in participants’ thinking. And such local coherence in thinking increases with age. In other words, science education with focus on science knowledge has not successfully taught student global coherence in thinking, which is the most important part of science reasoning.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=107,42.3,2011,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Research has found significantly positive relationships between playfulness and innovation behaviors in professional workers. However, little attention has been paid to age difference, gender differences, and the interactive effect of these twos. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interactive effects of age and gender on playfulness and innovation behavior in professional workers. A total of 1477 participants (672 males and 810 females) from education, arts and communication, high-tech industry, and traditional industry were involved the survey. Adult Playfulness Inventory (API) and Innovation Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ) were used to collect data. The major findings are as follows: 1) There is an interactive effect between gender and age on playfulness. No significant differences was found in API among different age age groups of males or females Males in younger age groups (age < 40) show significantly higher playfulness than females in equivalent age groups However, no significant difference was found between males and females in older age groups (age > 40). 2) There is an interactive effect between gender and age on work innovation behavior. No significant differences was found in IBQ among different male age groups. Interestingly, females of age 50-59 show significantly higher innovation behavior than females of age 20-29. In addition, males under age 50 show significantly higher innovation behavior than females in equivalent age groups, but no gender difference was found in age group 50-59. 3) In general, innovation behaviors do not decrease in professionals with the increase of age. Female professionals even show higher playfulness spirits and innovation behavior after age 40 or 50. It is suggested that stereotypes of senior professionals be avoided and that supportive environment and management be provided to reinforce employee’s playfulness and innovation behavior according to their gender and age differences.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=105,42.3,2011,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Developing Narrative Structure in Preschoolers’ Retellings of a Story Book: Episodic analysis,"Hsin-Hsi Chen, Chien-Ju Chang, Hsiu-Fen Chen","Chinese, episodic analysis, narrative structure, preschoolers, story grammar","Based on the story grammar framework proposed by Stein and Glenn (1979), this study aimed to analyze story elements and macrostructure in preschoolers’ retellings of a story book, and explore the effect of age differences on such narrative structure. Two hundred and eight narratives produced by children of three age groups, age 3 (N = 59), age 4 (N = 75), and age 5 (N = 74), were transcribed, coded and scored using the CHILDES system. One-way ANOVA was adopted to analyze the effect of age on narrative performance. The study findings show that, except for story background information, there are significant differences in internal plans, consequences, and reactions between five-years-olds and three-year-olds. It was also found that, the performance scores in frequencies of initiating events, internal responses, and attempts of five-year-olds are significantly higher than those of the four-year-olds as well as the three-year-olds. In terms of macrostructure, older age groups tend to present stories in purposive and pisodic structure and include more causal relationships in their stories. However, the percentages of abbreviated episodes does not decrease with the increase of age in this study, which is inconsistent with the prior research findings. The result may shed light on the development of preschoolers’ narrative structure and provide suggestions for preschool education, and future research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=102,42.3,2011,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Developing Two-Tier Diagnostic Instrument for Exploring Students’ statistical misconceptions: Take “Correlation” as the Example,"Tzu-Chien Liu, Yi-Chun Lin","correlation, misconception, statistics education, two-tier diagnostic instrument","Statistical literacy is essential to people of modern era. However, research has shown that students often hold misconceptions when they study statistics. Although two-tier diagnostic instruments have been developed for diagnosing and exploring students’ misconceptions in other fields of science, few are availble in statistics education. Therefore, the main purpose of the current study was to develop a two tier diagnostic instrument: Two-tier Diagnostic Instrument about Correlation Misconceptions (TDICM). This instrument was adopted to analyze the responses of 982 12th-graders who had taken statistics courses to “correlation”, and to explore the types, universality, and possible causes of such misconceptions in correlation. The research results showed that: (a) TDICM has satisfactory levels of difficulty, internal consistency reliability, and discrimination; (b) most participants do not have good comprehension of “correlation” concepts. Although some were able to answer the questions correctly in the first tier of TDICM, they failed to do so in the second tier due to lack of comprehensive understanding of correlation; (c) students’ responses in the two-tier model indicated that there are 14 correlation misconceptions universally held by the participants; (d) seven of the 14 misconceptions has been discussed in the literature, and others were identified in this study. Furthermore, the possible causes of these misconceptions and the implications in education were discussed. Finally, this study provided some suggestions to the application of two-tier diagnostic instrument and the correlation misconceptions in statistics education.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=103,42.3,2011,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Conscious Mechanisms of the Influences of Argument Position and Argument Quality on Senior High school Students’ Argument Agreement/Disagreement Responses,"Cheng-Hong Liu, Hsueh-Chih Chen, Wen-Jer Chang, Jen-Ho Chang","argument position, argument quality, arguments agreement/disagreement model of a counterpositional situation (CSAAM), automatic processing, conscious processing","People often make ‘‘agree or disagree’’ judgments on arguments in daily life and education settings. Researches have been exploring the communication phenomena relating to this topic and several studies indicated that the position and quality of an argument would influence whether people agree with it (when an argument is compatible with prior beliefs or strong in quality, tendency to agree it is elicited), but very few has examined the conscious/automatic essences of the processing routes this study aimed to examine. Sixty-four high school students were involved in Experiment 1 and it was founded that the influence of argument position on judgments was conscious processing as the participants were aware of such influence, and it could also be corrected by instructions which reminded the participants to monitor the judgments objectively (monitor reminding). However, although the participants were also aware of the influence of argument quality on their judgments, the results did not show facilitating effect of monitor reminding. After revising the procedures of Experiment 1, the Experiment 2 with 73 high school students found that the influences of argument quality and position could be respectively corrected or facilitated by monitor reminding. The results of Experiment 3 with 96 high school participants indicate that both influences of argument position and argument quality were conscious processing inasmuch as the influences were interfered by distraction task and the participants were aware of the influences.

A Follow up Study of the Relationship of Maternal Parenting Behaviors and Young Children’s Independent Completion on Task,"Shih-tseng Tina Huang, Liwen Lee",socialization; young children; maternal parenting,"The present study attempted to investigate the relationship of maternal parenting behaviors and young children’s independent completion on task. Fifty-eight dyads of children and their mothers were tested and followed up after six months. Maternal behaviors such as praising, repetition of children’s verbal responses, threatening, and physical interruption were measured when children were 17 months old in mother-child free play. In a clean-up session, children’s responses of completing task independently, with mothers’ assistance, with avoidance, or with refusal behaviors toward mothers’ demands were measured when children at 17 and 23 months. Familial socioeconomic status, mothers’ age and education served as families variables. Results suggested that with age, children increased their frequencies in independent completion of the task, and their needs in mothers’ assistance decreased. Mothers’ age positively correlated with their education and praising behaviors toward children. Children’s independent completion of the task at 17 months of age, were positively correlated with mothers’ education and threatening behavior. Children’s independent completions of the task at 23 months were positively both with children’s independent completion at 17 months and mothers’ verbal repetition behavior. At both 17 months and 23 months of age, children’s refusal behaviors toward mothers’ demands were negatively correlated with children’s independent completion of the task. Mothers’ physical interruption behaviors at 17 months were negatively correlated with children’s independent completion of the task at 23 months of age. At 23 months old, children’s avoidance behaviors were negatively correlated with their independent completion of the task. The results of hierarchical regression analysis with family background (step 1), children’s responses at 17 months (step 2), and mothers’ parenting behavior (step 3) suggested children’s independent completion behaviors at 17 months predicted children’s responses at 23 months when eliminated the effects of variables of family background. Furthermore, with controlled of both family background and children’s responses at 17 months, mothers’ parenting behavior predicted the changes between children’s responses at 17 to 23 months. The results suggested that maternal repetition of children’s verbal behaviors predicted the change of children’s independent completion in between 17 and 23 months of age.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=69,42.2,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Children’s Understanding of Concealing Emotion,"You-Chen Chen, Jui-Chih Chin","children, concealing emotion, understanding of concealing emotion, emotional display rules","The purpose of this study was to explore how children’s understanding of concealing emotion varied as a function of age, gender, and contexts. The subjects consisted of 153 children, and they were interviewed individually. The results indicated that, regarding children’s understanding of concealing demands, their understanding increased with age. They were more able to tell the concealing demands in self-protective and negative contexts. Furthermore, eight-year-old children were better at perceiving the demands of concealing emotions in prosocial contexts than six-year-olds. On the other hand, in self-protective contexts, six-year-olds were better than the four-year-old group. Besides, girls were better at perceiving the needs to conceal negative, rather than positive, emotions, whereas boys did not show such difference across emotion valences. With regard to the understanding of effective ways for concealing emotions, older children were better than the younger ones. In addition, children across age groups understood effective ways to conceal emotions more in the contexts of self-protection and negative emotions. Lastly, the degree of disguise (i.e. the intensity of facial expression of replaced emotion) was stronger when children tried to conceal negative emotions than positive ones.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=71,42.2,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effects of Mood and Objective Self-Awareness on Helping Intention and Helping Behavior,"Fan-Yu Yang, Wen-Jer Chang","helping behavior, helping intention, mood, self-awareness","The purposes of this study are to investigate the effects of mood and objective self-awareness on the helping intention and explicit helping behavior. This research consists of 3 experiments. In Experiment 1, a 2 × 4 factorial design with two variations in mood (positive and negative) and four types of self-awareness (high, low, no, and interrupted) was employed. The mood variations were induced with music. The dependent variables were helping intention and helping behavior (signing a petition and working as a volunteer). No main effects or interaction effects were found. In Experiment 2, the mood was induced through a recall task. A 2 × 2 factorial design with 2 mood states (happy and sad) and 2 self-awareness levels (high and low) was used. The dependent variable is the intention to help another. Neither main effects nor interaction effect was found from the results of a two-way ANOVA. In Experiment 3, the mood was induced with music used in Experiment 1. But the dependent variable was measured differently. The numbers of characters the subjects agreed to write for the experimenter as a help was operationalized as the degree of helping behavior. A 2 × 2 factorial design with 2 mood states (positive and negative) and 2 self-awareness levels (awareness and no awareness) was used. The ANOVA revealed main effects for mood states and self-awareness. The interaction of mood and self-awareness was also found: The different effects of mood on helping behavior were found only in no self-awareness condition.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=75,42.2,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The purpose of this study is to explore if this phenomenon also remains in high school, junior high school, and elementary school teacher groups. Hence, how the function of subjective well-being mediating the relationship between working hours and depression was working is investigated. There are 984 teachers randomly selected from the north, the central, and the south of Taiwan. All of the participants have to complete two questionnaires, i.e., Subjective Well-Being Scale and Taiwan Depression Scale, to measure the subjective well-being and depression. The results show that teachers with longer working hours would have higher risk in depression. Second, working hours were different among three levels of teachers.

The Relationship between Connectives and Reading Processes: Evidence from Eye Movements,"Yi-Ling Chan, Hwawei Ko","connectives, eye movements, incremental interpretation.","Two experiments examined the effect of connectives in sentence and text reading. The arguments about the role of connectives are between delayed integration hypothesis and incremental interpretation. According to delayed integration hypothesis, readers process two clauses linked by a connective by interpreting each clause separately and combining them when they reach the end of the second clause. However, incremental interpretation considers semantic processing takes place incrementally. In the first experiment, readers’ eye movements were monitored as they read sentences containing adversative connectives “but” with different clausal semantic relatedness. The results showed readers spent more processing time on clauses with less semantic relatedness. Connectives helped reader integrating clausal semantic information. There was no interaction between clausal semantic relatedness and connectives. Moreover, readers’ first gaze duration on the end of second clause was not longer than any other content words. It seemed to indicate readers didn’t integrate clauses at the end of the second clause. Readers integrated words incrementally. In the second experiment, both adversative and causal connectives were inserted in texts. The incremental interpretation was also observed. These experiments support that connectives facilitate reading and readers integrate semantic units incrementally.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=73,42.2,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The sampled 213 fifth graders were categorized into four disposition types based upon their profiles involving school grades, affective self rating, mathematics computer game, and standardized mathematics tests. Four distinct disposition types were derived from the empirical data: intelligent, engaged, test-oriented, and avoidant. The research findings show that the mathematics intelligent students were motivated and willing to take challenges. They enjoyed the learning process. The mathematics engaged students were motivated, persistent and resilient to setbacks. The test-oriented students tended to be afraid of failures and have strong self-defensive mechanisms.The mathematics avoidant are passive learners with low self-esteem. There are significant differences in the mathematic growth among students with different disposition types, and the growth slopes of engaged type is noticeably higher than test-oriented type.

Participants were 864 eighth-graders (50% boys and 50% girls; the mean age is 14.01) from 28 classes of two public schools. The study used peer nomination questionnaire to measure “sociometric popularity”, “peer-perceived popularity”, and “relational aggression”, and a self-report scale to measure “loneliness”. The results show that sociometric and peer-perceived popularity are two distinct constructs. Both popularity types negatively correlate with loneliness. Sociometric popularity negatively correlates with relational aggression, while peer-perceived popularity positively correlates with relational aggression. Lower level of sociometric popularity predicts stronger relational aggression for girls than for boys.

A Review Study of Taiwanese Counseling and Psychotherapy Qualitative Research Between 1992 and 2006,"Li-fei Wang, Shu-chun Lin","counseling & psychotherapy, qualitative research, review study","The study provided an integrative review of qualitative research(methodology, topics, & trend) in counseling and psychotherapy in Taiwan between 1992 and 2006. There were 246 qualitative studies of counseling and psychotherapy and the number of counseling and psychotherapy qualitative studies has rapidly grown since 1992. Qualitative studies constituted one-sixth of all counseling and psychotherapy studies published from 1992 to 1996 and one-third among those published between1997-2006. Over 40% of the studies claimed “qualitative research” as the method; the methodologies they adopted were diverse. The most frequent sample studied was the “Client,” following by the “Therapist.” Among client samples, “Adults” who were not college students were the most often studied, followed by “Children.” Single case was the most frequent sample size. Nearly 60% of the studies used six or fewer participants. Research topics focused mostly on processes and outcomes of counseling and psychotherapy, therapist professional development, and counseling relationships or dyadic interactions between therapists and clients. No qualitative study of the elderly population has yet been published. Detail results and suggestions for further research are discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=87,41.4,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The information literacy and skills are the key competences for lifelong learning. The purposes of the study were to design portfolio system of information literacy and to examine the validity of the portfolio. The framework of the portfolio was based on Big Six skills approach. The following elements of the portfolio were developed: information tasks integrated into subject area units, scoring procedures for each of the tasks, the structure of the portfolio, and the reliability and validity study of the portfolio. The distinguishing features of the portfolio are model-based framework, integrated information tasks, and context-sensitive consideration. Based on information literacy literature review, teacher interview, and curriculum analyses, researcher designed and developed the content of the portfolio, the information tasks, and the rubrics. Three aspects of validity highlighted by Messick (1995) were used as validity criteria for the portfolio: the convergent and discriminant evidence, the consequential, and the substantive aspects. Results showed that the portfolio had good convergent validity, but lacked of good discriminant validity. The portfolio enhances students’ information literacy and has positive influence on teaching.

The Effects of Regulatory Focus and Temporal Distance to the Goal on Creativity,"Fa-Chung Chiu, Fe-Yan Yau","action recency, creativity, defense focus, offense focus","Creativity has commonly been thought as a personality trait, but, actually, it also could influence through transient priming clue. This study had three experiments to investigate the priming effects of “regulatory focus motivation” and “temporal distance to the goal” to the creative performance, respectively. Experiment 1 and 2 induced two kinds of focus motivation, respectively. One is promotion (by asking subjects to think offensive mission), the other is prevention (by asking subjects to think defensive mission).The results, relative to the control group, showed that promotion focus motivation priming can improve the performance on Chinese Remote Association Test (CRAT) and Test of Insight Problem (TIP). But, the prevention priming can not inhibit the performance of CRAT and TIP. Experiment 3 investigated the interactive effects of regulatory focus motivation and temporal distance to the goal. The method of inducing regulatory focus motivation is the same as experiment 1 and 2, and inducing temporal distance to the goal by asking subjects think the war mission of near temporal distance (offense or defense tomorrow) or distant temporal distance(offense or defense next year). The results showed the performance on CRAT has interaction, within the promotion focus condition the group of near temporal distance was higher than the group of distant temporal distance and control group, but, within the prevention focus condition the result was vice versa. Moreover, the performance on CRAT within the near temporal distance condition the group of promotion focus was higher than the group of prevention focus, but, within distant temporal distance condition it was no difference between the group of promotion focus and prevention focus. This study suggests promotion focus motivation facilitate stability the performance of creativity. Moreover, the temporal distance to the goal moderate the relationship between the regulatory focus motivation and the performance of creativity.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1737,41.3,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The mental representation during the mental rotation task- explore the complexity and integrity effects,"Cheng-Ching Han, Daisy L. Hung, Jie-Li Tsai","complexity, integrity, mental imagery, mental representation, mental rotation","The nature of the mental representation during the mental rotation process is controversial. In our experiment, this issue was investigated by manipulating the integrity (reference lines) and complexity (square numbers) of the stimuli. The monotonic relation between transformation time and angular difference was found to be influenced by the integrity of the stimuli. As reference lines in a picture specified relative spatial relation among the picture’s components, when the space relation among a picture’s components was clear, participants did not rely on the ability of mental rotation to achieve this task. However, there were individual differences in the perception of spatial relations in the pictures. Nevertheless, the linear relationship was not modulated by stimulus complexity, which increased the overall reaction time. We inferred there are two subtle processes in the mental process of mental rotation – rotation of a reference line and reconstruction of the image. The degree to which participants relied on each process was accessed by the characteristics of the stimuli.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1739,41.3,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Character complexity was defined in two ways: (1) the number of constituent strokes for characters (Experiment 1), and (2) the number of constituent radicals for characters (Experiment 2). Length was defined as the number of constituent characters for words (Experiment 3). A lexical recognition task was used in three experiments. The participants consisted of 45 third graders with low decoding abilities, 42 third graders with average decoding abilities, and 37 third graders with high decoding abilities. The findings are as follows. First, when high frequency characters were selected as stimuli and character complexity was defined as the number of constituent strokes of characters, third graders with different decoding abilities showed character complexity effects; however, the slop of low decoding ability group was steeper than those of average and high decoding ability group. Secondly, when character complexity was defined as the number of constituent radicals of characters, third graders with different decoding abilities did not show character complexity effects.

Recent empirical researches found that people who are state-oriented have many maladaptive behavioral symptoms. This study divided 113 college students into three kinds of action control dispositions: action orientation, cognitive state orientation, and emotional state orientation. The aim of this study was to explore the interaction effects between action control orientation and success/failure conditions on negative affective reaction, self-efficacy, and working memory capacity. A 3 (action control orientation) × 2 (conditions) × 2 (measurement occasion) mixed design was used. The following results were obtained: (a) in the failure condition, the emotional state-oriented scored higher in the posttest than in the pretest in negative affective reaction; (b) no matter which orientation the subjects were, in the failure condition, they scored lower in the posttest than in the pretest in self-efficacy; (c) no matter which orientation the subjects were and which condition they were in, they scored higher in the posttest than in the pretest in working memory capacity.

An Investigation of Interactions between Pretend Play and Peer Conflict from the Perspective of Metacommunication and Frame Theory,Wen-Yueh Lu,"metacommunication , peer conflict, pretend frame","This qualitative study explored eight 4-year-old children’s peer conflict during pretense. Based on Bateson’s (1972) idea of metacommunication and Goffman’s (1974) frame theory, the researcher found that whether to be in-frame or out-of-frame to negotiate conflict was closely related to the following features: nature of pretense, pretend phase, number of oppositional turns, discourse skill, goal of peer interaction. Most conflicts occurred in socio-dramatic pretense and during dramatization phase. They often caused children to step out of pretend frame. Those who shared understanding about pretense, including collaborative and parallel players, could metacommunicate longer in-frame. The more oppositional turns were exchanged, the less engrossed children were in pretense. Children applied a variety of discourse devices, such as “pretend”, “right”, and “too” to evoke comradeship, integrate different opinions, transform symbolic ideas, mutually aware while monitoring each other’s mind. The findings inspire preschool teachers to recognize the characteristics of peer conflict in children’s pretense, as well as appreciate its significance in the development of pretend play and metacommunicative abilities.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1742,41.3,2010,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

In these four components, the two core components of affect and executive volition would influence learning behavior directly, but the effects of the two other components of value and expectation would be mediated by the two core components, and thus influence learning behavior indirectly. Participants of this study were 480 sixth-grade students in Taiwan. The research instruments employed were “Primary School Learning Motivation Scale” and “Primary School Learning Behavior Scale”. Data collected were analyzed by structural equation modeling with the LISREL computer program.

First of all, the findings indicated that happiness and excitement were generally the positive emotional feelings for students. In contrast, anger, indignation, depression, and enviousness were the most common negative feelings of children’s emotion in elementary school. When dealing with students’ feelings, teachers are more concerned about students’ negative emotional feelings than positive ones. Secondly, when facing emotional issues, most students displayed catharsis, aggression, attack, resistance, and repression etc. When confronting with students’ strong or intense emotional behavior that might cause immediate harm, teachers tended to intervene instantly. Yet, when facing students’ emotional behavior with no sign of immediate harm, teachers usually chose to delay interventions or ignored treatments purposely. Thirdly, teachers often adopted the intervention strategies of “listening and empathy” as well as “intermediation and conciliation” to deal with students’ emotional issues.

Participants were 32 Chinese fifth graders recruited from 4 different classes. Before the oral reading session, students were divided into high and low reading ability groups based on their performance on a reading comprehension test. The task for the students was to read aloud two expository texts, each containing approximately six to eight hundred characters and was selected by experienced teachers to ensure that the materials were age-and grade-appropriate. During each individual oral reading session, data were audio-recorded and later transcribed verbatim. The errors made by the students can be classified into 7 types: Substitution, Self-correction, Repetition, Omission, Insertion, Reversal, and Others. The three most commonly found reading errors were Substitution, Self-correction, and Repetition, each accounted for at least 18% of the total errors made by students in both high and low reading ability groups. Additional analysis focused on the predominant error type, Substitution, by further dividing the errors into 9 subtypes based on the cues (graphic, phonetic, or semantic） that students used. It is noteworthy that when students encountered unfamiliar characters, they tended to derive the pronunciations by using context-related semantic cues, which accounted for more than 40% of the total Substitution error type. When comparing the performance of students in high and low ability groups, results indicated that low ability students made significantly more Substitution type of errors, and their errors, in other types (e.g., Omission and Insertion） were also less semantically acceptable.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1746,41.1,2009,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Phonological Representation Unit in the Phonological Awareness Task among Taiwanese Students,"Jun Ren Lee, Hwawei Ko","phonological awareness, phonological grain size, reading acquisition","The finding that explicit phonological representation can facilitate encoding and retrieving of words is a major progress in reading development research. Yet, the grained-sizes of phonological units operate differently in different writing systems. This study demonstrates that Taiwanese employ the Zhu-Yin-Fu-Hao phonological system as functional operating unit in a sound deletion task. We observed the same results in elementary school children and undergraduate students. We argue that the functional operating unit of explicit phonological representation in Chinese is neither syllable nor phoneme, but the initials and finals of the Zhu-Yin-Fu-Hao phonological system.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1750,41.1,2009,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Exploring the Factors That Influence Sixth Graders’ Cubic Enumeration: The Roles of Spatial Orientation and Visualization,"Pi-Chih Chang, Chao-Jung Wu","chunking, cube enumeration, spatial ability, spatial orientation, spatial visualization","The task of enumerating the number of 3-D cube arrays is used to evaluate and develop student’s spatial ability. This research investigates the roles of spatial orientation and visualization of sixth graders in cube enumeration. The material included two types of cube arrays – low regularity and high regularity. We tested two independent variables in low regularity arrays – number and distribution of hidden cubes. The former had four levels (i.e., 4, 5, 6, or 7) of hidden cubes. The latter were divided into two axes and three axes according to the degrees of the hidden cubes. High regularity arrays were divided into outside intact and non-intact types depending on whether the appearance is integral or not. Paper-and-pencil questionnaire was group-administered to collect the hit rate of 204 students. Individual interviews were also conducted to gather data on hit rate, response time, difficulty rating, and strategies from 40 students. Results showed that high regularity arrays yielded better performance than low regularity arrays, and two axes condition yielded better performance than three axes condition. The effects of the number of hidden cubes are not as steady. There are no significantly differences in hit rate and response time between the intact and non-intact groups. Current literature (Battista et al., 1996, 1998, & 1999; Ben-Chaim et al., 1985) has claimed that students’ difficulty in cubes enumeration is due to deficiencies of mental imagery or orthogonal coordination. However, we argue that visualization is more influential than spatial orientation.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1751,41.1,2009,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Behind Smiling and Suppressing: Psychological Processes in Emotional Labor of Elementary School Teachers,Wen-Tzu Chiang,"emotional labor, teachers’ emotions","Teaching involves immense amounts of emotional labor. However, there is a lack of research on teachers´ emotional labor. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the psychological processes in emotional labor of elementary school teachers, including their interactions with students, parents, administrators, and colleagues. Specific goals of the study included：(1) to analyze the causes of positive emotional expression through surface acting and deep acting, and (2) to understand the psychological processes of how teachers regulate their negative emotion. A qualitative approach using grounded theory strategy was used to explore the research question, through in-depth interviews with 18 elementary school teachers. Results showed that teachers expressed positive emotions by surface acting, mainly because of the courtesy exchange and personal status, whereas positive emotions display by deep acting, were mainly due to teaching needs, professional identity, and personal trait. The suppression of negative emotion was for many reasons, including avoiding regret, considering consequences, ethical compliance, empathy, personality cultivation, and professional maturity. The outbreaks of negative emotions were due to exceeding tolerance limit and using strategies. Teachers expressed negative emotions in classroom management for the purposes of warning, and avoiding hurt.

Under-performance is regarded as the degree of test scores obtained that are below normal baseline, as measured by the differences between formal and simulated College Entrance Examination scores in this study. A total of 459 third year high school students completed the Exam Preparation Anxiety Scale one month before the College Entrance Exam and the On-exam Anxiety Scale immediately after the exam. The findings revealed that pre-exam emotionality and pre-exam worry directly increased confrontation anxiety. Confrontation anxiety directly increased test score under-performance; however, pre-exam worry directly decreased test score under-performance. Further analyses were conducted between test score under-performance of each participant and test anxiety. The test score under-performance of Chinese language was negatively correlated with pre-exam emotionality and pre-exam worry, while that of Math was positively correlated with confrontation anxiety.

The study was conducted using a mixed-method approach, where video-taped teaching sessions and interviews were used for data analysis. Results indicate that the combined elements of ""cognitive conflict"", ""modeling learning"" and teachers’ ""implicit theory"" contributed to teaching concept and behavioral changes in teachers. Under the three elements, two teachers changes were made in the instruction goals and contents. Rather than explaining the meaning of the teaching material, students were encouraged to formulate their own understanding and hence abstraction of the material. However, the interaction between the teacher and students were still largely based on the teacher doing the majority of the initiatives. Finally, this study supported that the strategy of cognitive conflicts and modeling could enable teachers to use new self-questioning instruction and to improve the concept of learning.

Choice of Weighting Scheme in Forming the Composite,Shun-Wen Chang,"composite score, composite weighting, effective contribution, effective weight, nominal weight","The present study investigated and compared the results of establishing composite scores based on the five weighting schemes of the equally-weighted model, the reliability weighting model, the standard deviation (or SD) weighting model, the error of measurement weighting model, and the effective score point model. The purpose of this study was to seek optimal relative weights in forming the best composite possible, as well as to offer more information about the various weighting schemes considered on the different measurement qualities of the tests. The five tests of the Basic Competence Test (BCTEST) were employed for exploration in this research. A random sample of 5,000 examinees drawn from the data obtained from the 2005 test administration was used. To evaluate the various weighting schemes, this study examined the statistical and psychometric properties of the test scores and the weighted composite scores, the effective contributions of individual tests to the composites, as well as the impact on the admission decisions. The findings indicated that the reliability coefficients of the variously formed composite scores were all very high. However, with regard to the effective contributions, the results were very different among the various weighting schemes. Overall, the SD and the error of measurement weighting models seemed to perform better in establishing the composites than the reliability or the effective score point model, although there still remained the issue of inequality of the effective contributions for both the SD and the error of measurement models.

No Blood Means Less Harm?: Relational Aggression and Peer Rejection in Adolescence,Ching-Ling Cheng,"adolescent, peer rejection, physical aggression, relational aggression","The purpose of this study was to explore gender differences in the forms of aggression experienced by and perpetrated on Taiwanese adolescents, and to examine the relationship between aggression and peer rejection during adolescence. The participants consisted of 2211 adolescents (1127 boys and 1084 girls) from 62 classrooms of 13 junior high schools in Taipei area. A peer nomination procedure was used to obtain each participant’s aggression scores and sociometric status. The number of nominations received for each item was further standardized within each classroom and used for further analyses. The findings show a gender effect in two forms of aggression – relational and overt aggression: (1) Girls were significantly more relationally aggressive than boys, whereas boys were significantly more overtly aggressive than girls; and (2) Ninety-five percent of adolescents in the overt-aggression group were boys and eighty-three percent of adolescents in the relational-aggression group were girls. The results also demonstrated that both relational and overt aggression were predictive of concurrent peer rejection in this sample of adolescents. Relational aggression was the highest in adolescents of controversial status than in all the other groups (i.e., rejected, average, popular, neglected). Thus, the study demonstrates that relational aggression is favored by female adolescents and it is a salient factor of peer rejection.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1420,40.3,2009,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Effects of Gaps-Minimizing Approaches on the Raw-to-Scale Score Conversions When Forms Vary in Difficulty,Shun-Wen Chang,"BCTEST, form difficulty, gaps, raw-to-scale score conversions, scale score","This study explored the various adjusting procedures for minimizing the size of gaps resulting from the raw-to-scale score conversions under test forms that varied in difficulty. The no adjustment, the fixed mean, the varying mean, and the varying mean/SD approaches were compared using the data simulated based on the three-parameter extended beta-binomial model for the five tests in the Basic Competence Test (or BCTEST) administered from 2001 to 2003. The BCTEST is a national standardized assessment in Taiwan and the forms of each of its tests varied slightly in difficulty over these years. The desired gap sizes were set at 3, 4, and 5 scale score points at the high end of the scale. The criteria for comparing the adjusting approaches over the years were by means of the summary statistics, reliability, overall SEM, SEMs by true score in proportion-correct score units, and the number of scale score points changed due to the truncation as well. The results showed that test form difficulty affected the performance of the various adjusting procedures to some extent and no one method could accomplish the goal of reducing the gap sizes at the upper end without negatively affecting the other scale score attributes. Imposing adjustments on the gaps at the high end of the scale would exert more effects on the easier forms than on the harder forms. The impact due to adjustments decreased as the forms increased in difficulty. Overall, the varying mean/SD strategy was judged the most preferable. Findings from this research have fostered the understanding of the gaps issue and have raised greater awareness of the role that test form difficulty plays in establishing the score scales.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1783,39.S,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
An Exploratory Study of the Relation Between the Average Saccade Amplitude and Creativity Under the Eyetracker Mechanism,"Hsuch-Chih Chen, Shu-Ling Peng, Chian-Chih Tseng, Ha-Wjeng Chiou","creativity, eyetracker, the average saccade amplitude","The purpose of this study was to examine the relation between the Average Saccade Amplitude (ASA) and Creativity under the eye tracker mechanism. The original concept is from Friedman, Fishbach, Förster, and Werth (2003). This study proposed that the principle of the ASA collected by eye tracker is similar to the scope of perceptual attention, and there is a positive relationship between the ASA and creativity. Furthermore, the ASA would affect the scope of conceptual attention, and in turn affect creative performance. According to the above description, there are four designed studies to test the relation between the ASA and creativity. Participants were Taiwanese students. In Studies 1, 2, and 3, participants watched 8 pictures for gathering the ASA data. We also collected scores of creative personality traits in CPAI-2, the test of Divergent Feeling and CRAT from the above participants. Pearson’s correlations were used in the study. Results suggested that the correlations among the ASA, creativity (including personality trait of divergent thinking and curiousness), and CRAT were significantly positive or close to positive. In Study 4, we manipulated participants’ ASA scope, and then observed their performance in insight problem solving. t-test was used to analyze the data. The results showed that the ASA had no effect on the performance in insight problem solving. Based on these findings, we argued that the ASA is related to some specific problem-solving in creativity rather than insight problems, or the relation between the ASA and creativity were spurious.

Construction of Adolescent Multi-Domain Self-Efficacy Scale in Taiwan,Shung-Liang Tsai,"academic efficacy, career development efficacy, interpersonal efficacy, physical efficacy, confirmatory factory analysis","The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument for measuring adolescents’ multi-domain self-efficacy. An attempt was made to establish the norm of the Adolescent Multi-Domain Self-Efficacy Scale which can be used as a reference index for identifying potentially maladaptive adolescents in Taiwan. According to Bandura’s approach to self- efficacy measurement, a reasonable self-efficacy measurement should be about a specific activity field. A 60-item draft scale was developed for the preliminary study of validity and reliability. A 4-point Likert-type scale was adopted to measure participants’ self-efficacy. A sample of 326 junior and senior high school students was used for the preliminary study. Through exploratory factor analysis and item analysis, four factors were derived from the final 36-item measure of self-efficacy (academic efficacy, career development efficacy, interpersonal efficacy, and physical efficacy). Confirmatory factor analysis was adopted to examine the construct validity and reliability of the final 36-item scale. Results indicated that the scale’s construct validity and reliability are acceptable. For the purpose of establishing the norm of adolescents’ multi-domain self-efficacy scale in Taiwan, a stratified sampling method was adopted. Two factors were taken into account: region (Northern, Central, Southern, and Eastern districts of Taiwan) and school type (junior high school, senior high general school and senior high vocational school). The norm was established using a sample of 1849 students. Statistical properties of the scale are presented.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1785,39.S,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effects of Concept-Mapping Learning Strategy and Spatial Ability on Elementary Students´ Cognitive and Metacognitive Strategies and Science Academic Performance,"Fu-Yun Yu, Yu-Shin Chen","cognitive strategy, concept-mapping, metacognitive strategy, spatial ability","The purposes of this study are three-fold: (1) to examine the effects of concept-mapping on students’ cognitive and metacognitive strategies and science academic performance; (2) to investigate the interaction effects between the concept-mapping learning strategy and students’ spatial ability; and (3) to understand students’ attitudes towards the adopted strategy. A non-equivalent control-group experimental research design was used. Four classes of fourth-graders participated in the study for the support of their science learning for seven consecutive weeks. One-way ANCOVA found a statistically significant effect of concept-mapping on students’ cognitive and metacognitive strategies as compared to the traditional teaching approach. Two-way ANCOVA, however, found no significant interaction effects between concept-mapping and students’ spatial ability on science performance, cognitive or metacognitive strategies. Finally, students participating in concept-mapping learning activity expressed significantly positive attitudes toward the introduced learning strategy. Suggestions for classroom teachers and future studies were proposed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1786,39.S,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Research on Emotional Intelligence Measurements and Adaptive Index of Junior High School Students,Lee-Chou Chen,"emotional cognition, emotional expression, emotional reflection,emotional regulation, positive inspiration","The purposes of this research are to construct the Scale of Emotional Intelligence suitable for use with junior high school students, to develop an adaptive index for their EI measurements, and to compare the EIs of students with different backgrounds (region, school, grade, sex, family structure, parental educational level and profession). From a sample of 2,029 junior and senior high school students, factors and indices for the EI Scales were determined through analysis of various items and factors. Reliability, validity, and norm of the Scales were then examined upon the scales’ completion. Results of the research show that EI Scales are capable of effectively measuring 5 separate abilities: emotional cognition, emotional expression, positive inspiration, emotional regulation, and emotional reflection. Emotional regulation and emotional reflection differ among students from different regions. The average values for emotional cognition, emotional expression, and positive inspiration differ among students from different grades. Students with different birth order also differ in total EI scores and in individual EI scores. Female students tend to have higher EI total scores and in each individual EI scores than male students. Finally, parental educational level or profession was not related to EI scores.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1787,39.S,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Reliability of Information Literacy Portfolio Assessment in the Primary Grades,Yuwen Chang,"dependability coefficient, generalizability coefficient, information literacy, portfolio assessment, reliability","This article reports on the reliability of information literacy portfolio assessment in the primary grades. Three central questions were examined: (1) how reliable are total scores of information portfolio? (2) how reliable are scores of big six skills? and (3) what are probable sources of unreliability? Do teachers who rate their own students’ work systematically score differently than do outside raters? The framework of information portfolio was based on the big six skills approach. This assessment was based on a sample of approximately 70 portfolios integrated three learning areas for students in Grades 3 and 5: language arts, mathematics, and science and technology. The teachers were required to collect each student’s portfolio for 3 semesters. The products of portfolios in each learning areas were rated by 3 raters: the student’s classroom teacher, a teacher of the same primary school, and an external reviewer. Results indicated that most of the generalizability coefficients for total scores were above 0.75 across learning areas and semesters with a single rater. The dependability coefficients revealed a similar pattern with slightly lower size. Variance in scores of each processing dimension was attributed to individual difference, processing dimension, interaction of individual difference and dimension, and interaction of individual difference, dimension, and rater. The generalizability coefficients for the six-dimensional task were around 0.5 to 0.6. The results indicated that instructional planning based on scores of specific information skill should be questioned. In general, the correlations between classroom teachers were higher than those between classroom teachers and external raters. Classroom teachers tended to rate student portfolios higher than did external raters; however, these differences were small. This study showed that given a solidly structured portfolio, teachers can reliably rate their students’ work.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1788,39.S,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Of 2400 primary and secondary school teachers stratified and sampled randomly from Taiwan, 1141 teachers responded to the 20_item CES-D Scale, including 535 teachers in the Internet group, and 606 teachers in the paper group. This research used multidimensional latent regression module developed by ConQuest software. Using one-parameter item response theory, we compared the differences between the Internet and paper questionnaire groups. The results of this study showed no significant difference between the two groups in background variables; nonetheless, response rate in the Internet group was lower than that in the paper group. As for comparisons between content of questionnaires, although the latent means of the Internet group were significantly lower than those of the paper group, these differences had no substantial meanings. The group variable of survey mode explained close to zero variance in factors of the CES-D Scale. To examine whether Internet questionnaire survey can be used to substitute for paper survey in order to reduce research and administration cost, we encourage more comparisons between the two survey modes.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1789,39.S,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

This inventory is based on the theory of culinary creativity and the concept that “development” is a continuing process. The inventory includes 7 major aspects: preparation, incubation and transformation, realization, discovering new ideas, discussion and compromise, illumination, and idea evaluation. There are 40 criteria included in the inventory using a 6-point Likert scale. One thousand participants were invited to participate in the research, and 669 valid responses were returned. Frequency distribution, descriptive statistics, item analysis, Cronbach α, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson’s correlation analysis, and ANOVA are techniques employed to analyze the data collected. Internal consistency ranged from .77 to .91, and construct validity is tested using factor analysis. Results supported the reliability and validity of the inventory. It was found that gender and educational background were related to the development of culinary creativity development. In addition, chefs and students demonstrate different developmental processes because they possess different culinary experience.

However, the multilevel perspective of creativity remains theoretical speculations. There are few empirical studies about creativity from the multilevel perspective. The purpose of this study, based on Amabile’s motivational synergy model and theory of organizational creativity, was to explore the impact of task motivation and organizational innovative climate on adult education teachers’ creative teaching performance. A total of 1091 samples from 135 adult education organizations were collected. Using hierarchical linear modeling for data analysis, results indicated that intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation both had positive impact on creative teaching performance.

It also examined the effects of interpersonal strengths on college students who experienced large number of life events. Survey data were collected from 270 college students of six universities in Taiwan. Results from structural equation modeling analyses indicated that interpersonal strengths fully mediated the relationship between the numbers of life events and mental health. Moderation of perceived stress by interpersonal strengths on mental health was not supported. Additionally, about 45% of the variance in psychological well-being was accounted for by forgiveness, sense of humor, and gratitude. Perceived stress, forgiveness, sense of humor, and gratitude explained about 36% of the variance in social well-being and 48% in emotional well-being.

Thirty young children were asked to tell the story of a wordless picture book Frog, where are you before (pretest) and after (posttest) they read this book with their parents. A five-level scoring system was used to code children’s and parental explanation of the causal link between the mental state of the story characters and the story events. Parental book reading styles and questionnaires about joint book reading practices at home were also examined. Three main findings were observed: (1) Children who performed better in the posttest were those whose parents received higher scores in level of misrepresentation narratives in joint book reading. (2) Children whose parents scored higher in misrepresentation level and had more discussion with their children during joint book reading showed better skill in mental state narration, but the children whose parents were more dominant and scored lower in misrepresentation level exhibited more difficulty in narrating mental states of characters. (3) The initial age of children being read to was significantly associated with the level of children’s misrepresentation narratives.

The study conducted the Young Children’s Emotional Regulation Strategy Scale and the Coping with Children’s Negative Emotion Questionnaire were administered to 296 caregivers with preschool children aged 5-6 in the Taipei area. At the same time, Children’s preschool teachers also completed the Young Children’s Temperament Scale. The main findings were as follows: (1) In terms of young children’s emotional regulation strategy, the frequent strategies used are as follows: “caregiver searching,” “language expression,” “cognitive guidance,” “aggression,” and “venting and pacifying.” Children’s temperament type seemed to influence their use of emotional regulation strategy. (2) As a whole, caregivers use more Expressive Encouragement (EE), Problem-Focused Reactions (PFR), and Emotion-Focused Reactions (EFR); less Distress Reactions (DR), Punitive Reactions (PR), and Minimization Reactions (MR) while coping with children’s negative emotions. Caregivers with diverse education backgrounds also display their reactions differently. (3) When caregivers use more EE, PFR, and EFR, as well as less DR, PR and MR, their children were more likely to display cognitive strategies. On the contrary, when caregivers use less EE, PFR, and EFR, as well as more DR, PR and MR, their children are more likely to display behavior strategies.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1427,40.2,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Do significant Others’ Feedback Iinfluence one’s Creative Bhavior? - Using Structural Equation Modeling to Examine Creativity Self- Efficacy and Creativity Motivation Mediation Effect,"Su-Pin Hung, Hung-Yu Huang, Sunny. S. J. Lin","creative motivation, creative self-efficacy, feedback from significant others","This study aimed to construct a model of significant others’ feedback, inner process, and creative behavior based on social cognitive theory, and explored the role of creative self-efficacy in one’s inner process. Participants were 636 undergraduates from six universities in Northern Taiwan. The results were analyzed using three methods. First, we compared Model 1 (- creative self-efficacy influencing intrinsic motivation and, extrinsic motivation) and Model 2 (- creative self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation were parallel). The result indicated that Model 1 is a better fit with data than Model 2, which supported social cognitive theory. Second, the result showed that positive feedback was directly predictive of creative self-efficacy and extrinsic motivation, as suggested by hypothesis suggested , but not predictive of intrinsic motivation. Third, people perceived positive feedback and negative feedback from their significant others, though could not directly predict creative behavior; they displayed indirect effect on creative behavior through mediated variables. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that when individuals receive feedback, one often evaluates the task and feedback. Then the evaluation outcomes that we called creative self-efficacy will affect one’s motivation which in turn affects creative behavior. Based on these results, recommendations for future research are discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1428,40.2,2008,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Taking data structure into consideration, a two-level hierarchical linear model analysis was conducted. Data were collected from students who completed the mathematics self-concept items on student questionnaire and standardized math achievement tests that developed specially for TIMSS 2003. There were 4601 4th graders and 5355 8th graders. As predicted, results indicated the effect of individual student achievement on math self-concept were substantial and positive, .439 for 4th graders and .720 for 8th graders for linear component, .062 for 4 graders and .139 for 8th graders for quadratic term. The effect of school-average achievement on mathe self-concept are less substantial and negative, -.215 for 4th graders and -.261 for 8th grade. These effects are statistically significant and provide a strong replication of the contrast effect. As expected, a developmental change in the achievement-self-concept relation was supported. The interaction effect of individual student achievement and school-average achievement on math self-concept was only significant for 8th graders, but not for 4th graders.

Due to limitation of cross-sectional data, the Unification model was further divided into an internal/external frame of reference model (I/E model) and a motivation-resource competition model (MR model). In support of the I/E model, math achievement had a positive effect on math self-concept but a negative effect on science self-concept. On the other hand, science achievement had a positive effect on science self-concept but a negative effect on math self-concept. Consistent with the revised MR model, self-concept in one domain (math or science) had a positive effect on achievement in the same subject, but a negative effect of achievement in another domain (science or math).

Five married adults (2 males & 3 females between 28 to 38 years of age) with medium to severe hearing impairment participated in a semi-structured interview. Open coding method was applied to analyze collected data. Individual experiences in mate selection of the five married hearing-impaired were presented. Factors affecting their mate selection include the following：(1). Hearing impairment and related issues were salient topics in mate selection: (a) Hearing impairment was a ground for rejection; (b) setback in relationships led to low self-esteem and realistic expectation for marriage; (c) communication styles of the hearing impaired was considered a prerequisite for mate selection; and (d) satifsfying psychological needs of hearing impairment facilitated development and stability of intimate relationship. (2). Family and social relations had both direct and indirect influences on mate selection: (a) Family cutivation and respection to family menbers’ opinions were considered critical factors; (b) experiences of hearing-impaired friends had impact on mate selection perspectives; (c) mate selection opportunities were determined by physical space and social comection; and (d) mate selection styles reflected traditional gender differences. (3) Diverse and realistic coping strategies were needed to overcome mate selection difficulties toward successful marriage: (a) Adjust cognitions, accept reality and be accommodating of others’ perspectives; (b) divert attention and focus to avoid being painful; (c) confront prejudice, stay flexible and assertive; and (d) proactively seek communications and acceptance, and minimize conflicts. These factors had cyclical and interactive relationships with one another. Some of these factors were not different from that of non-hearing-impaired people, while others were unique to the hearing impaired, especially inevitable challenges from being a minority in mate selection situations.

Age Differences in Children’s Perceptions of War,Liang-Yu Deng,"Age, Children, Ethnicity, Perception, War","This study explored differences in children’s perceptions of war among three age groups. A qualitative research design was adopted. In-depth interviews were conducted with a total of 50 children recruited from two mid-western university towns in the U.S. Comparisons of perception differences also were made between Taiwanese American (TA) children and non-Taiwanese American (NTA) children on the basis of different age groups. Age was found to be an important factor influencing children’s perceptions of war. In general, children in the youngest age group described war mainly in terms of war activities and weapons. Those in the middle and oldest age groups were much more likely than the youngest children to include consequences and causes of war in their descriptions. Individual differences also were discussed. The results of this study indicated a strong similarity between TA and NTA children’s descriptions of war; however, a few differences also were identified, some of which seemed to be related to TA children’s unique cultural background. Piaget’s cognitive development theory and Symbolic Interactionism were adopted to explain and understand the differences found in age groups and ethnic groups.

Thirteen events were taken into account and analyzed. All events were intensively analyzed by adopting the framework of Discrimination Model. Results of the study showed that the supervisory intervention with the focus on process and the role of teacher was most common of all, and the focus on personalization changed with supervision stages. Second, most of the impact on the supervisee was positive. The supervisee’s feelings often underwent some kind of transition during an event. Seven categories of global impact of events were concluded. Lastly, supervisee-perceived impact changed with the supervisor’s interventions, apparently with the supervisor’s role assumed.

A Study of Stress Response Caused by Personality and Social Support:Combining Psychometric Meta-Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling,"Bao-Yuan Huang, Sieh-Hwa Lin","personality, physical and mental health, social support, stress response","The purpose of this study was to combine both psychometric meta-analysis and structural equation modeling to inspect the fitness of “Personality-Stress Mode.” There were two stages in this research. In the first stage, the relationships among all of the observed variables were searched through 116 reports and 429 comparisons from the reports. Consequently, the designed coefficients among 13 observed variables all reached the significant level of .05, and therefore produced a 13x13 correlation matrix. In the second stage, an analysis was made for the fitness between “Personality-Stress Mode” and all observed data. Five aspects were discussed in this research regarding the “Personality-Stress Mode”: personality, work stress, life stress, social support, and physical and mental health. Also, all observed data were meta-analyzed. As a result, the fitness between the “Personality-Stress Mode” and all observed data was satisfactory. Before this research was done, personality was considered to be much related to work stress, life stress, social support, and physical and mental health. Social support was believed to ease off the stress. The results above supported the hypothesis of this research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1765,39.2,2007,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Resilience Model Among First-Year College Students Who Experienced Traumatic Events,Wen-Chih Tseng,"adaptation, college students, resilience, traumatic events","The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between exposure to traumatic events and adaptation outcome among first-year college students, and to examine the effects of psychosocial resources on first-year college students with a history of exposure to traumatic events. Survey data from 2,806 first-year college students of six universities in Taiwan were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The study found approximately 41% of respondents reported at least one traumatic event and the group of students who reported having experienced any trauma in the past scored lower on adaptation index than participants who did not. Results also indicated that well-adjusted students who had experienced any trauma had greater optimism, higher self-esteem, stronger secure attachment, more perceived social support, and greater use of proactive coping, as compared to maladaptive students. These psychosocial resources and the number of different types of traumas explained about 55% of the variance in adaptation index. The effect of self-esteem on adaptation index was the most significant. Moreover, the path model indicated that perceived social support and proactive coping partially mediated the relationship between optimism/self-esteem/attachment and adaptation index. In addition, the study found that the number of different types of traumas was a predictor of perceived social support and proactive coping. Implications for these complex relations are discussed for both counseling interventions and future research.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1767,39.2,2007,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Technology-Mediated Learning Performance:A comparison of Technological and Vocational Education and Private Enterprise,Tai-Kuei Yu,"social cognitive theory, technology-mediated learning, SEM, model comparing","In the era of a knowledge economy and lifelong learning, all enterprises, governments, or individuals hope to gain competitive superiority by acquiring and applying knowledge efficiently. With technology-mediated learning, the content of knowledge can be transmitted and exchanged by digital methods. These methods can easily blend with multimedia to create learning materials whose content can be memorized and attract the attention of learners more easily. Thus, technology-mediated learning can provide more flexibility as well as learning opportunities. This research was based on social cognitive theory to explain how technology-mediated learning applies to behavioral patterns. The objective of the survey focused mainly on technical and vocational education and private enterprises that apply technology-mediated learning. A total of 598 valid questionnaires were divided into two groups (undergraduates and employees) according to their learners’ profiles. Through the examination of structural equation modeling on the multi-group samples at a .05 significance level, the path coefficients of “social influence” on “motivation” and “self-efficacy” on “learning performance” had no significant influence.

A Study of Folk Concepts of Good Life and Subjective Well-Being among College Students,Wen-Chih Tseng,"subjective well-being, positive affect, meaning in life, life satisfaction, happiness, good life","What constitutes a good life? Two qualities have been espoused in psychological literature. The first is happiness. The second is meaning in life. However, in this modern society of consumption culture, the pursuit of money not only helps people meet their basic needs but also fulfills their material desires. This study examined the folk concepts of a good life and subjective well-being among college students. Participants (N = 357)drawn from a national university in northern Taiwan rated the desirability and moral goodness of happiness, meaning in life, and income. The subjective well-being of college students was assessed with life satisfaction and affect measures. Results revealed significant interaction effects of happiness and meaning with regard to desirability as well as moral goodness, whereas money was relatively unimportant. These results suggest that the combination of happiness and meaning is essential in the folk concept of the good life. The finding that income was highly desired but lower in moral goodness may reflect the conflict between traditional social values and today’s consumer culture, which contributes to college students’confusion in values and life goals. With regard to subjective well-being, our college students scored lower in life satisfaction and affective well-being as compared to the students in other nations. This result suggested that we should attempt to increase our college students’experience of happiness and meaning in life in order to enhance their subjective well-being. However, we should also help our college students keep their vision of the good life in their pursuit of happiness and meaning to prevent them from getting lost in this money-driven, consumer culture.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=113,38.4,2007,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The 192 participants came from 6 classes, which were randomly assigned to each of the 6 experimental conditions. It was found that, despite the number of repetitions and story difficulty, students listening to the easy story had higher comprehension scores than those listening to the hard story. For the easy story, no significant difference was found between any two repetition groups; however, for the hard text, those students listening to the story three times did obtain significantly higher comprehension scores than those listening to the story only once or twice. With regard to repetition, after listening to the story twice, the students’growth of comprehension became stable. These results indicated that repetition had a positive effect on listening comprehension and the difficulty level of a text plays an important role in listening comprehension. It is concluded that, when presenting information, the teachers should base their decision as to the number of repetitions on material difficulty and student ability in order to improve the students’listening comprehension.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=120,38.3,2007,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Two hundred and twenty-seven college students were randomly assigned to three analogical learning situations (worked-out examples, worked-out examples + logical structure illustration, control) to work on four practice items with or without falsification worked-out examples. Their performance on 16 test items of deontic rule testing showed that worked-out examples could enhance the use of falsification reasoning only when test items shared the same semantic structure with the worked-out examples. When test items differed from the worked-out examples in the semantic structure, the success of analogical learning occurred only when there was no surface similarity between them. These findings suggest that in scientific reasoning a scientist’s challenge lies in extracting a problem’s underlying logic of rules and meanwhile excluding the misleading effect of surface similarity.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=121,38.3,2007,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Effects of Solution-Focused Supervision,Wei-Su Hsu,"empowerment, postmodern supervision, psychotherapy-based supervision, solution- focused supervision, supervision effect","The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of solution-focused supervision (SFS). Six supervisees, one male and five females of 25-35 years old, participated in the study. Each participant received four sessions of SFS that were taped and transcribed. Additionally, data were collected from following-up questionnaires completed by the supervisees three months later as well as records written by the supervisor after each supervision session. Data were analyzed using a qualitative research method. The effects of SFS for these supervisees included (1) identifying and achieving supervisory goals: redefining their difficulties and needs, trusting and respecting clients more, and getting information about how to intervene immediately and comprehensively; (2) enhancing their self-efficacy of counselor role: increasing awareness and affirmation on their accomplishments, discovering and appreciating their exceptional experiences and resources, and increasing their confidence, tolerance, and stability in being a counselor; and (3) promoting counselor professional development: realizing how to keep improving themselves, reflecting on the counseling profession and the role of the counselor, and promoting the identity of the counselor’s role and changing their learning attitudes.

The Influence of Teachers on College Students’Learning Styles and Occupational Stereotypes in Technical Courses: The Role of Modeling Priority,"Chao-ChinYang, Wen-Bin Chiou","college students, modeling priority, social learning theory, learning styles, vocational stereotypes","The article aimed to investigate the differences in modeling priority between technical teachers and lecturing teachers, and whether the role models affect college students’learning styles and vocational stereotypes in the collaborative teaching of technical courses. One hundred and seventy-four freshmen were recruited as participants in this longitudinal study. Results indicated that the modeling priority of technical teachers was higher than that of lecturing teachers, which means that technical teachers were more likely to be identified as role models by students in collaborative teaching. As to learning styles, the college students significantly preferred the experience-driven mode to the theory-driven mode regardless of whether their role models were technical or lecturing teachers. Cross-legged panel analysis showed that the students perceiving higher modeling priority of technical teachers subsequently exhibited greater preferences for the experience-driven mode. Meanwhile, the students who initially preferred the experience-driven mode also perceived higher modeling priority of technical teachers subsequently. Similar relationships were found between modeling priority of lecturing teachers and students’preferences for the theory-driven mode. For the students who identified technical teachers as role models, their vocational stereotypes were more consistent with technical teachers than with lecturing teachers. In contrast, for students who identified lecturing teachers as role models, their vocational stereotypes were more consistent with lecturing teachers than with vocational teachers. The relationships among teachers’modeling priority, learning styles, and vocational stereotypes were stable over a one-semester period. Research findings were discussed and conclusions and implications were proposed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=136,38.2,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Development of a Learning Potential Assessment Package of Inductive Reasoning for Children,Shwu-Ching Jiang,"cognitive function, dynamic assessment, inductive reasoning, learning potential assessment, mediated learning.","The purpose of this study was to develop a learning potential assessment package in inductive reasoning that may be used to evaluate and promote the reasoning ability of kindergarten and first grade children. The package consisted of the three modules of classification, series completion, and analogical reasoning. The subtests of Inductive Reasoning Test for Children were conducted in pretest and posttest. This test had satisfactory internal consistency, test-retest reliability, alternate-form reliability, discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. Norms were also developed for this test. In the stage of mediated learning, a semi-standardized intervention was employed to upgrade children’s cognitive functions. During this stage, the Cognitive Function Rating Scales and the Social Interactive Rating Scales were used to assess the learning process. Both scales had acceptable interrater reliability and expert validity. This study focused on estimating the construct validity of the three modules. Subjects were children with the age of six or seven. Each experimental group received one module. The control group had only pretest and posttest. Each group was administered the subtests of CTONI in addition to other tests. A three-way mixed design analysis of variance was used to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching. The results indicated that each module uplifted the reasoning ability of children on the Inductive Reasoning Test for Children and CTONI. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to estimate the predictive validity. The results showed that the cognitive function score in the four mediated learning stages contributed significantly to the prediction of inductive reasoning post-test score. Besides, some of the social interactive criteria were significant predictors of this post-test score.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=135,38.2,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Perceptions of Risk and Protective Factors among High Risk Students in Junior High Schools,"Shind-Dr ew Lin, Pei-Yu Chen, Mei-Ju Chen","high risk student, protective factor, risk factor","The purpose of this study was to investigate the risk and protective factors that may cause or postpone risk behaviors in high risk students. The participants were 6 male and 4 female junior high school students in central Taiwan who were regarded as high risk students by their counselors or mentors. All data were analyzed with the open coding method. The risk and protective factors were presented and discussed from the aspects of individual, family, school, and society. The following factors were found: (1) The individual aspect: The trait of internal-external control affects the students’interactions with different environments; whether or not one’s daily emotional experiences are understood and accepted has an impact on the occurrences of risk behaviors; the degree of mature thinking and misconceptions influences the motives behind daily behaviors. (2) The family aspect: Attitudes toward parenting affect parents-children relationships; family background and the satisfaction of belonging need affect the occurrences of risk behaviors; the relationship with one’ s own family affects the willingness to participate in the risk behaviors. (3) The school aspect: Attitudes toward teachers’disciplinary methods affect students’motivation in learning; the way of interactions with peers affects the probabilities of risk behaviors; academic achievement and teacher-student relationships affect classroom adjustment. (4) The society aspect: The mass media provides both useful knowledge and negative models; some friends outside schools constitude positive models, but some facilitate risk behaviors; regulations and law are functional in warning youngsters against delinquency. Finally, based on the results of this study, suggestions as to the counseling of high risk students are given.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=137,38.2,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Influences of the Ability Estimation Methods on the Measurement Accuracy in Multidimensional Computerized Adaptive Testing,Po-Hsi Chen,"Bayesian expected a posteriori, Bayesian maximum a posteriori, maximum likelihood, multidimensional computerized adaptive testing","The goal of the research was to investigate the influences of ability estimation methods on multidimensional computerized adaptive testing. In stage 1, different quadrature points of the Baysian expected a posteriori (EAP) estimation were manipulated in order to find out the appropriate quadrature point of EAP in multidimensional computerized adaptive testing (MCAT). In stage 2, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, the Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, and the EAP estimation methods were used in two kinds of ability dimensions (two and four dimensions) and two kinds of correlations between dimensions (high correlations and low correlations). The target item numbers of MCAT were 20, 40, 60, and 80. The dependent variables were the average reliability, bias, and the root mean square of error (RMSE) in all ability dimensions. Results in stage 1 indicated that the higher the quadrature point and the ability dimensions, the much higher the estimation time of MCAT. Ten points was appropriate in less than 4 dimensions of MCAT when the estimation time and the reliability of ability estimation were taken into consideration. Results of stage 2 indicated that MAP and EAP methods resulted in higher reliability and lower RMSE than ML method, especially in the conditions of high correlation between abilities, more ability dimensions, and fewer MCAT items. There were advantages and disadvantages in the three estimation methods. The regression bias of MAP, the estimation times of EAP, and the reliability and RMSE of ML were the problems that should be resolved when executing MCAT.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=139,38.2,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
Dropout from Supervision: An Intensive Analysis of One Supervisory Dyad,"Shao-Ling Hsu, Shiou-Ling Tsai","dropout, supervisee, supervisor, supervisory process","The purpose of this study was to investigate what was happening in a prematurely terminated supervision case with the focus of observation on the interactions between the supervisor and the supervisee. We analyzed four sessions of one supervisory dyad in order to draw a comprehensive picture of the supervisory process. Our analysis showed that the dropout of this supervisee was caused by a series of mild and severe conflict events. Similar conflicts occurred repeatedly. We found that with the accumulation of unsolved supervision relationship problems, negative emotions of the supervisee grew. Seven poor supervisory behaviors persistently appeared in the supervision. Of these, three were most prevalent: the supervisor confronted and evaluated negatively the supervisee; the supervisor misunderstood the supervisee’s intentions and behaviors, and the supervisor did not focus on the supervisee’s problems or difficulties throughout the supervisory process. We speculated that dropout could have been avoided had the supervisor recognized the factors sabotaging the supervisory relationship and adjusted her interaction styles in relating with the supervisee.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=140,38.2,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

This paper aims to explore the learning attitude of business users toward a newly implemented IT. Two variables, anxiety and learning interest, were employed to define the learning attitudes. This study investigated how 4 exogenous variables affect the user learning attitude through two mediating variables of TAM, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The 4 exogenous variables were internal computer knowledge and 3 external learning environments: technology support, learning climate and training. For the purpose of this study, a casual model concerning an implemented IT of ERP system was constructed and tested. The sample consisted of 119 workplace users from 3 small-medium scale manufactories that had just implemented new ERP systems. The results indicated that, except for the training factor, each of the exogenous variables had significant direct or indirect effects on user learning attitude. The training factor did not affect the learning attitude, but it had significant relationships with the external factors of technology support and learning climate.

The effect of attention allocation in the encoding of pictorial stimuli and the applications in teaching,"Man-Ying Wang, Lin-Yu Wang","adjunct pictures, illustrations, pictures, repetition priming, words","This study explores how study context and perceptual processing demands in picture recognition affect attention allocation and, in turn, memory encoding, as well as the applications of current findings in teaching. The repetition priming paradigm was adopted in two experiments. Relative magnitudes of picture-picture (P-P) and word-picture priming effects were compared. The results showed that when pictures and words were mixed in the study phase or when the recognition of the picture required processing of local perceptual features, attention was perceptually directed and resulted in perceptual encoding of the picture. If, however, the recognition of the picture did not require local processing and the surface format of pictures and words did not lead to contrast in subjects, no evidence of perceptual encoding for pictures was found. These findings suggest that: (1) memory encoding of pictures is not a simple process even though pictures are customarily regarded as an‘easy-to-learn’text adjunct; (2) pictorial encoding is determined by whether and how study context and processing demands affect the manner in which attention is allocated; (3) in devising a pictorial learning aid, learning activity should be so arranged that it properly directs students’attention allocation and the adeptness of the learner in pictorial processing should also be understood.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=130,38.1,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Attachment and Perceptions of Verbal Parenting as Related to Emotional Stability for Adolescents in Taiwan,"Yi O-Yang, Li-Chuan Wu, Shieh-Hwa Lin","adolescents, attachment, perception of verbal parenting , emotional stability","This study investigated how attachment and perceptions of parent’s verbal parenting are related to emotional stability for adolescents in Taiwan. The sample comprised 537 junior high school students in Taipei. The instruments used in this study were Inventory of My Experience, Inventory of My Family Experience, and Inventory of My Life. Data obtained in this study were analyzed with t-test, multiple regression analysis and two-way analysis of variance. The results indicated that, when father-daughter attachment was controlled by statistics, the relationship between father-daughter communication and daughter’s emotional stability had a significant negative correlation. Our results also confirmed the general consensus that the secure attachment between parents and adolescents, as well as perceptions of positive verbal parenting among adolescents, are beneficial to the emotional stability of adolescents. The results indicated significant gender differences in the attachment relationship between adolescents and fathers, with sons having a more secure sense of attachment with fathers than daughters did. However, no significant gender differences existed for the attachment relationship between adolescents and mothers, the perceptions among adolescents of verbal parenting from mothers, the perception among adolescents of verbal parenting from fathers, and the emotional stability of adolescents. Moreover, when the attachment between fathers and daughters was secure, the emotional stability of daughters did not show any difference whether or not fathers used positive verbal parenting. However, when the attachment between fathers and daughters was insecure, positive verbal parenting from fathers benefited the emotional stability of daughters. Finally, some specific implications of this study for the design and providing of counseling services to adolescents and their parents are proposed, and some suggestions for future research are also made.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=285,37.4,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The results are as follows: (1)The majority of participants perceived: the shaking of old rules and the increase of new coping approaches, the impropriety of past coping modes, and the enhancement of positive self concepts; (2) Some participants perceived that their mates became more active in expressing themselves; (3) Some participants perceived decreased conflicts in relationships, more direct communication between mates, and an increased sense of security; (4) The majority of participants perceived that their own changes lead to the changes in observational learning in groups, the leadership of the group leader, the group exercises, and the reciprocal changes from the mate; (5) Some participants noted that their mate’s changes caused changes in group exercise experiences; (6) Some participants regarded the changes in mate relationships as stemming from their own changes. Finally, the researcher discusses the results and makes some suggestions with regards to the counseling practice and further studies.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=284,37.3,2006,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The Effects of Superficial and Structure feature matches on the Story Reminding Performance of Students at Different Ages,"Ju-Ling Chen, Yi-Fen Su","analogy, superficial feature, structural feature, story reminding performance, the process of analogy","The main purpose of this research was to investigate the effects of superficial feature and structural feature matches of analogical stories on students’ story reminding performance, and whether the effects were vary with age differences. The findings are as followed: Firstly, The result suggested that both superficial feature and structural feature may influence story reminding performance. The better the two features matched, the better the story reminding performance. However, there was no interaction between the two factors. Secondly, the effects of superficial feature and structural feature match on story reminding performance changed with age difference. There was a significant difference between the performance of the fourth grade students of elementary school and that of other age groups. The performance of college students was better than that of other age groups in all conditions. The performance of story reminding improved with the increase of age.3. The reminding patterns of different age groups were different. College students showed the strongest response to superficial feature match and structural feature Tmatch. Junior high school students showed similar story reminding patterns with college students, but the response differentiation of junior high school students were not as clear as that of college students. The sixth and fourth graders in elementary school showed much less clear differentiation of superficial feature match and structural feature match response than college students and junior high school students did.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1277,37.2,2005,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Nondisclosure of Supervisees in Supervisory Process,Hsu Shao Ling,"nondisclosure, supervisee, supervision, supervisor, supervisory process","The purpose of this study was to investigate nondisclosure of supervisees in supervisory process. Six counselors of master degree in practicum were supervised from four to six times. Each time when supervision ended, they were interviewed immediately, while watching the videotapes of the supervisory process. According to the results, nondisclosure of supervisees occurred in each supervisory session. However, the first session of the whole supervisory process had the highest frequency of nondisclosure. With supervision proceeded, the nondisclosure has the tendency of decline. Averagely, each supervisee had 3.96 nondisclosures in each session. The most common nondisclosures were the information related interaction between supervisor and supervisee. Within them, negative emotions and evaluations toward supervisor were most popular. The effects of nondisclosures all were negative, especially centered on professional learning as a counselor. At last, except both positive emotion and positive evaluation on supervisor did not have any negative effects, the other categories of nondisclosures all had such effects and their most significant effect was on professional learning as a counselor.

In the study , the effort/accuracy tradeoff model was used as the framework and the production system was used to model the mental processes of the choice strategies. The concepts of elementary information processing (EIP) and relative accuracy (RA) were also used to measure the effort and accuracy in the decision process. A computer simulation was undertaken to compare different strategies of effort and accuracy in various decision environments. The results suggest that no single strategy did well across all task and context conditions under the consideration of saving effort and gaining high accuracy. The finding indicates that under the higher time pressure and larger task size condition, several heuristic strategies were more accurate than the truncated normative strategy. Therefore, under the consideration of effort and accuracy tradeoff, decision-makers use a variety of strategies contingent upon a number of task and context variables.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1304,36.2,2004,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Effects of Ways for Composing Chinese Characters on the Development of Character Recognition,"Yi-Chen Wu, Hsiu-Shung Huang","Chinese categories, word recognition, growth pattern of word recognition","This study examined whether certain categories of Chinese characters were more difficult to learn and whether the phonetic component found in some characters plays an important role for children learning to read Chinese. Participants were 3655 Chinese students from grade 1 through 9. Results indicated that there is a statistically significant relation between grade and character recognition ability at the elementary level, but not in junior high, and that some categories were significantly more difficult to recognize than others. The rank order of the character difficulty for categories, from hard to easy, was phonetic complex > logical aggregates > imitative drafts = indicative letters. Thus, the Chinese characters in the phonetic complex category are more difficult than the characters in the other three categories. When this category was further broken into five Subtypes, there were significant differences in recognition accuracy among these Subtypes. According to the results, students have the best accuracy of word recognition when the Chinese character with a different pronunciation than the phonetic component and have the worst accuracy of word recognition when the Chinese characters with the same pronunciation as the phonetic component.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1309,36.1,2004,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The sample consisted of 320 female adults in Taiwan. Instruments used in this study included Spann-Fischer Codependency Scale, Personal Attribution Questionnaire and Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale. Data obtained in this study were analyzed by Canonical correlation analysis and ANOVA. The primary findings were :1.The relationship between sex-role orientation and codependency dimensions (“Put the focus outside of self”, “lack of open expression of feeling” )in codependency had significant negative correlation with expressiveness (p < .05), and “identified caretaking activities” in codependency had significant positive correlation with expressiveness (p < .05).“Put the focus outside of self”, “captured a sense of purpose through relationship with others” and “lack of open expression of feeling” in codependency had significant negative correlation with instrumentalness (p < .05).2.The canonical correlation between sex-role orientation and codependencyI. The first canonical correlation between sex-role orientation and codependency showed that the more the female had expressiveness and instrumentalness, the less she had “put the focus outside of self”, “captured a sense of purpose through relationship with others” and “lack of open expression of feeling”. This result suggested that androgyous female had less “similarity to codependency”.II. The second canonical correlation between sex-role orientation and codependency showed that when a female had more expressiveness and less instrumentalness, she had more “identified caretaking activities” and “captured a sense of purpose through relationship with others”, indicating that “feminine” females had more“identified caretaking activities” and “captured a sense of purpose through relationship with others”.3.There were no interactions between different sex-role orientation and codependency scores for self-esteem.Based on these findings, “codependency” may be different from “similarity to codependency” or “expressiveness” (feminine orientation).

A Study of the Effects of Form-Focused Instruction in Communicative Contexts on English Performance for Junior High School Students,Ching-jung Wu,"English learning performance, error analysis, form-focus instruction, learning strategies","The purposes of this study were: (1) to investigate students´ errors in learning English with the use of qualitative analysis, and further to design a form-focused instruction program in communicative contexts; (2) to examine the effects of the form-focused instruction program in communicative contexts developed by the author. In order to accomplish these purposes, the researcher first investigated students´ errors in learning English with the use of qualitative analysis involving thinking-aloud and thinking-by-questioning methods. The participants were 15 eighth-grade students from three groups with high, middle, and low ability in English. The results classified the errors into two patterns: interlingual errors and intralingual errors. Then, according to the results of error analysis, the researcher designed a form-focused instruction program in communicative contexts and examined the effects of the program. The participants were 70 eight-grade students belonging to experimental group and control group. The instruments include: Metacognition Strategies Inventory and English Achievement Tests (Pretest and Protest). The data thus obtained were analyzed by two-way mixed-design ANOVA. In addition, the researcher analyzed the learning process of experimental group in English more deeply with the use of qualitative analysis. The results indicated that the form-focused instruction program in communicative contexts could help the experimental group maintain their performance in metacognition strategies and English learning achievement(reading, writing, and speaking). But the performance of the control group in these inventories and tests were declining. Furthermore, after the teaching, the students in experimental group could use the strategies to retain their learning intentions and be active to monitor, evaluate, and modify their English learning. In short, from the analysis of students´ English learning process, the students in experimental group became more confident and willing to learn English after the teaching.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1321,35.3,2004,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Diplomaism or Need for Educational Opportunity ? ––– The Social Meaning of Competition for School Admission,"Chang Yu-wen, WEN-YING LIN","diplomaism, educational opportunity, educational competition, educational demand","The study investigated the perceived as well as desirable educational opportunity in Taiwan. Compared to actual enrollment rate, researchers were able to infer the educational demand and the attributed causes for competition for school admission. There were 2052 participants and 808 of them having at least one child in school. It was a stratified random sample from Taiwan population. The results demonstrated that desirable educational opportunity and perceived educational opportunity were higher than actual enrollment rate. Also, desirable educational opportunity was higher than perceived opportunity. Based on parents desirable educational attainment for their children, the actual educational opportunity can only satisfy half the parents. Perceived educational opportunity, educational demand, and attribution for educational competition differed significantly by educational level. People with higher educational attainment were more likely to attribute competition for school admission to diplomaism rather than need for educational opportunity. The implications were discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1326,35.2,2003,Bulletin of Educational Psychology
The effects of career intervention strategies for improving cognitive complexity and career self-efficacy of junior-high students,"Shuh-Ren Jin, Hung-Bin Sheu","junior high school students, career construct system, cognitive information processing model, career counseling, career self-efficacy","This was a third-year project in a three-year research program. In order to develop effective career intervention strategies using cognitive approach for junior high school students, this research was designed to: (1) develop a repertory grid technique for assessing the career construct system of junior high school students（first year）；(2) investigate the relationship between the career construct system and career maturity（second year）；and (3) develop career counseling strategies based on cognitive information processing approach for under developed students in terms of cognitive complexity (low career integration and career differentiation )（third year）. The present study tested the assumptions that career intervention based on cognitive information processing would affect career complexity and career self-efficacy. Thirty-six participants, who were pretested for levels of cognitive differentiation, integration, conflict and career self-efficacy, participated in either the experimental group or the control group. Participants in experimental group completed four counselor-administered one-to-one career interventions including (1) meaning-enhancement for Repertory grid, (2) Card sort, (3) Computer-assisted vocation information system, and (4) balance sheet. Post-test and 3-week follow-up assessments indicated that, participants did not significantly change their levels of cognitive differentiation, integration and conflict over time across groups. However, male participants increased their levels of differentiation significantly than that of female participants in the experimental group. In addition, participants in the experimental group increased in levels of career self-efficacy over three weeks follow-up. These effects were not qualified by significant interactions by sex, which suggested no differential impact of sex on career self-efficacy. Results are discussed in relation to the literature on cognitive complexity, cognitive development, career self-efficacy and cognitive information processing.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1323,35.2,2003,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

Verification of Inferiority Coping Model：An Empirical Study of Supportive Guidance Program for Vocational College Students,Finland Cheng,"Feelings of inferiority, coping strategy, living adaptation, coping model, guidance program","By verifying the goodness-of-fit of the Inferiority Coping Model, the effects of a supportive guidance program for vocational college students was evaluated. Survey samples were collected and analyzed, adopting the weighted least square method to test the effectiveness of the model. Evaluated basic goodness-of-fit indices, internal and external quality of structure, indicated empirically a good fit with the model. Therefore, the empirical model could explain how feelings of inferiority, coping strategies, and living adaptation are related. Our results further demonstrated that feelings of inferiority could influence living adaptation by influencing problem-solving copying strategies. Restated, problem-solving copying strategies are the most prominent mediator between feelings of inferiority and living adaptation. Further analysis using a pretest-posttest, nonequivalent group mixed design to evaluate the effectiveness of the supportive guidance program, indicated that the program partially contributed to overcoming feelings of inferiority. Results further suggest that the qualitative paradigm can be adopted to discussing the category of coping strategies, as well as clarifying the most effective mechanism among related variables. Limitations are statistical approach and sample size.

Most conflicts resolutions were attempted to after the events. These consisted of one side presenting apology indirectly showing good will, or following the will of the other. 2. Most adolescents, especially of females, felt helpless, sad, disgusted, and scared when they faced with inter-parental conflicts. Partially resolved and unresolved inter-parental conflicts would elicit more sadness, anger, and disgust and more intervention from adolescents. 3. Most adolescents did not intervene in inter-parental conflicts.

Teacher Efficacy： Its Concept and Measurement,Chih-lin Sun,"self efficacy, teacher efficacy, Teaching Efficacy Scale","Teacher efficacy has been shown to be a powerful construct related to student achievement, school improvement, and education innovation. The research of this construct has born much fruit in the field of education. And yet there remains a lack of clarity in the concept and structure of teacher efficacy. Based on the self-efficacy theory developed by Bandura (1977) and the integrated model of teacher efficacy proposed by Tschannen-Moran, Hoy, & Hoy (1998), this study explored the concept and measurement of teacher efficacy. A sample of 415 primary teachers in Taiwan was administered an efficacy questionnaire adapted from the Teaching Efficacy Scale (TES). Factor analysis revealed that teacher efficacy is multidimensional in nature, comprising six factors : instructional efficacy, classroom management efficacy, efficacy to assess learning progress, efficacy to communicate with parents, efficacy to enlist teaching reform, and efficacy to change environment. The TES developed in this study differs from measures of teacher efficacy found in previous research, this study employed six dimensions of efficacy rather than separated subscales for personal teaching efficacy and general teaching efficacy. These results supported that teacher efficacy is a multidimensional concept, thus has implications for both theory and practice. Finally, the issues in the concept, measurement, structure, and application of teacher efficacy are discussed.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1333,34.2,2003,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The CRPG model is composed of five circular stages: planning, action, revision, evaluation, and reflection. Within each stage, various types of activities had been designed. Reading curriculum design papers, writing reflective journal, peer coaching, discussions with experts, and collecting teaching portfolio are among the most essential. Based on the above materials collected from the weekly meetings with the participating teachers during two consecutive semesters in 1999, this paper explored how the CRPG model affects the growth of teachers in terms of their teaching knowledge and beliefs, and teaching-related community relationships. It has been found that: (1) participating teachers become more flexible in classroom management and tend to reshape their instruction methods according to their teaching experiences, (2) student´s daily living experiences become the priority concern in the integrated curriculum, and the formative and authentic assessment of teaching are more emphasized, (3) the participants acknowledged that the students are active constructors of knowledge such that the teachers tend to combine their teaching concepts with materials other than textbooks to improve the students’ learning effects, (4) the teachers realized the objective of integrated teaching so as to encourage and assist students to develop higher level thinking, and (5) the new content enhanced by the networking method plus multiple materials have significantly promoted student’s learning effects. As to the teaching-related community relationships, the participants had successfully developed a friendly and effective teaching network and received help from the students’ parents and other sources.",http://epbulletin.epc.ntnu.edu.tw/contents/manage/detial.asp?id=1334,34.2,2003,Bulletin of Educational Psychology

The Mediating Role of Action Control between the Predecisional and Postdecisional Phases in Learning Processes,"Biing-Lin Cherng, Chen-Shan Lin","action control, learning motivation, learning strategy, self-regulated learning","Although learning motivation (intention to learn) and use of learning strategies (goal-directed behavior) are critical aspects of learning processes, researchers of self-regulated learning have recently begun to give greater attention to how action control processes mediate the road from learning intention to goal attainment. According to action-control theory, goal-directed activity should be divided into the predecisional and postdecisional phases. The action control plays a mediating role between the aforementioned two phases. This study was an attempt to test a structural model of the mediating role of action control between the predecisional and postdecisional phases based on recent action-control theory by using structural equation modeling with the LISREL computer program. Furthermore, the mediating effects of action control between the intention to learn and goal-directed behavior on high and low learning adaptation students were compared. Subjects were 492 students (49% males) from ten junior and senior high schools in Taiwan area. The results of this study are as follows: (a) the theoretical model fit the observed data well and the study supported recent results of research on action-control theory, (b) the action control maintained the intention to learn, supported goal-directed behavior and increased the effect of learning motivation on learning strategies, and (c) the students with high learning adaptation exhibited greater mediating effects of action control on learning processes than those with low learning adaptation.

A group of professional counselors with psychology and social work majors were recruited to participate in a two-year pilot project in selected junior high schools in 1997. A total of 38 professional counselors were invited to participate in three focus groups and to share their work experiences and difficulties. A semi-structured interviewing guide was used to solicit subjects’ personal input and interactive discussion. Qualitative analyses were applied to the collected data. The results of the analyses are as following: 1. School psychologists and school social workers are considered preferred titles for the counseling staff with psychology and social work majors. 2. Orientation training prior to job assignment is helpful for the pilot counselors to be familiar with the school setting and the needs of the students. 3. Clinical supervision is critical to the provision of quality guidance services. 4. The schools in metropolitan Taipei and Kaohsiung cities were found to have greater guidance resources than the schools in rest of the Taiwan. Work difficulties experienced by the subjects were: more clerical tasks than professional ones were allocated by the schools, their professional roles were not recognized by the school administrators, offsite supervision and in-service training were discouraged by the school administrators, professional counselors did not receive sufficient clerical support for their work, and more collaboration between professional counselors and guidance teachers was needed. The contributions to the school guidance services made by the pilot professional counselors were: providing different counseling perspectives, strengthening the communication and counseling network within the school, promoting the counseling knowledge and skills among the school personnel, and making better connection and referral between schools and community resources.

This study focuses on the question of whether there are sex differences in statistical reasoning for college students. Participants included 245 college students in Taiwan and 267 American college students. The Statistical Reasoning Assessment (SRA) was used in this cross-cultural study to assess students’ statistical reasoning ability. While the original version of the test was administered to students in the United States, a Chinese version of the instrument was administered to participants in Taiwan. Statistical methods were used to ascertain whether there were mean differences between males and females and whether there was equality between the correlation matrices for males and females. All the analyses are based on both the correct reasoning scores and the misconception scores obtained from the SRA instrument. Results tend to support the general research findings that when sex differences appear, they are in the direction favoring males, particularly in higher cognitive tasks such as mathematical reasoning. Analysis of the correlation matrices suggest that there are no differences in statistical reasoning between males and females for both countries.

Relationship Between Trait Mindfulness and Organizational-Citizenship Behaviors of Soldiers: Mediating Role of Psychological Capital,Ching-Yi Yang,"trait mindfulness, psychological capital, soldiers, Organizational citizenship behaviors","Context and Object: Military organizations differ in nature from other organizations. The professionalism of military organization members is demonstrated in the implementation of ""ultimate liability,"" which means to protect national security and make sacrifices for the well-being of the people at any point of time. Assisting soldiers to actively engage in organizational citizenship behaviors and become good organizational citizens is an important method to enhance their professionalism and ""ultimate liability."" Previous studies have shown that in the workplace, employees with more positive psychological and emotional capital tend to express more organizational citizenship behaviors. However, these results are mainly from studies on corporate employees; it is unknown if this is also true for military personnel. In addition, prior research on organizational citizenship behavior has rarely explored the possible effects of the positive psychological state. To fill these gaps, this study focused on soldiers as research targets and explored the relationship between trait mindfulness, psychological capital, and organizational citizenship behavior. Simultaneously, it verified the mediating effect of psychological capital between trait mindfulness and organizational citizenship behavior. Method: The study used purposive sampling; 407 soldiers from the two army camps in Taiwan were selected and analyzed using the structural equation model. Results: The results showed that: (1) trait mindfulness had no significant association with organizational citizenship behavior (path coefficient value β = 0.00, p > .05); (2) trait mindfulness had a significant positive association with psychological capital (path coefficient value β = 0.40, p < .001); (3) psychological capital had a significant positive relationship with organizational citizenship behavior (path coefficient value β = 0.83,p < .001); (4) psychological capital completely mediated the relationship between trait mindfulness and organizational citizenship behavior (indirect effect value β = 0.33, p < .05, 95% confidence interval did not contain 0). Conclusion and Suggestion: From the results, it can be seen that although the direct relationship between the soldiers' trait mindfulness and organizational citizenship behavior was not obvious, trait mindfulness can indirectly improve their organizational citizenship behavior performance by enhancing other positive psychological capital. In summary, the contributions of this study are as follows: first, it expanded the application and research scope of mindfulness in the military field. It showed that mindfulness can be used to promote soldiers' mental health and work performance in high-pressure situations; mindfulness also has indirect benefits in motivating altruistic and helpful organizational citizenship behavior. Second, this study confirmed that the soldiers' law-abiding and altruistic behavior in the military can be cultivated not only by the current methods of ethical appeals and moral training but can also be achieved by enhancing trait mindfulness and inner psychological capital. Based on the results, the author provides several suggestions for the practice of military counseling; for example, military mental health centers can systematically and continuously conduct related activities, encourage soldiers to practice mindfulness to enhance their self-awareness and insight abilities, cultivate psychological capital, and implement self-management for mental health. Political warfare officers and cadres at the basic level are the first-line counselors for soldiers. They are familiar with the life and training of the army. If they can integrate the skills and concepts of mindfulness-awareness into the military daily life and training, it can help develop the soldiers' military ethics. Finally, the author also suggests that the army should continue to explore and develop other activities that enhance soldiers' inner psychological capital, to improve their altruistic behavior and reduce unfavorable behavior in the military organization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-N202301310017-00001,66,2023,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
A Phenomenological Inquiry into the Career Development and Reentering College Experience of Youths from a Juvenile Correctional School,"Xun-Jia Tsao, Yu-Kuang Hsu, Shu-Hui Liu","phenomenological inquiry, lifeworld, self, Career development, youth in juvenile correctional school","According to previous research, almost all youths in juvenile correctional school drop out before committing crimes. However, some youths in the school study for attending university. This career change invoked the researcher's curiosity. The researcher aims to explore the experience of career development and return to school of youths from juvenile correctional schools, understand how these youths constructed different career paths compared with their past, and put forward the results as a reference for practitioners. The researcher interviewed three youths who left juvenile correctional school and attended university, asking them to tell their stories and describe their experiences of returning to school. The researcher used a phenomenological approach to analyze the self-expression of these youths and their interaction with the environment in the course of their career, leading to the revelation of the existing structure of the youths' career development. The result showed that the youths' career development contained the following four tendencies: (1) leaving the lifeworld of rules of law to make a living through relationships; (2) developing their self-esteem, interests, and career styles in the wild lifeworld; (3) considering others' expectations for them to study and reconstructing new successful experiences in the lifeworld of rules of law; and (4) integrating different lifeworld experiences while falling in the gap among various lifeworld and being pushing around, and developing their unique career projection. Considering these findings along with relevant literature, this study proposed that ""making a living"" and ""seeking a sense of belonging"" were two core links of youths' from juvenile correctional school interacting with others in their situations. The situational structure of the passing in and out school system in their career development showed the following: (1) The need of ""seeking a sense of belonging"" was an opportunity for them to invest in various lifeworld; (2) The need of ""making a living"" was the reason to leave their previous lifeworld; (3) ""Making a living"" (career development) developed via relationships (how they interacted with others in their situations); (4) The relationship developed via interweaving of ""making a living"" and ""seeking a sense of belonging""; and (5) Self was constituted via interweaving of ""seeking a sense of belonging"" and ""making a living."" Then, the researcher responded to the research questions and constructed the career development situation structure of the youths from juvenile correctional school who attended university. Finally, this study turned around the ideology that had not been noticed at the beginning of this inquiry and escaped from the bondage resulted from advocating diploma. It was found that, for these youth, in their career development experience, the meaning of attending university was as a means to connect to the lifeworld of the rules of law. Accordingly, it is suggested that corrective treatment should focus on assisting them to find an appropriate means of connection. The focus of juvenile delinquency prevention is to strengthen the youths' ""seeking a sense of belonging"" and ""making a living"" in the lifeworld of rules of law, and weaken these in the wild lifeworld. To enable practitioners to have a more detailed understanding of the career development of youths from juvenile correctional school, come closer to the lifeworld of these youths, and think about how to help these youths settle down in the world and live their life with meaning, as suggestions and strategies for living on their own.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-N202301310017-00002,66,2023,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Career Advancement for Disadvantaged Students: Integrating the Concept of Differentiation into a Peer Support Career Service Program Development and Implementation,Shu-Chen Wu,"disadvantaged students, peer support, differentiation, Career service","Many studies support the idea that the gap in income achievement between high- and low-income families can have direct and indirect influences on children's academic achievement and social opportunities. Considering disadvantaged students' career development pathways, as a result of low economic resources, poor living environment, and poor physical and mental health conditions, disadvantaged students tend to show low self-esteem, autonomy, and control, and experience more helplessness, hesitation, and anxiety about career choices and career adaptation. In addition, for disadvantaged students, economy is often the primary factor of consideration for career choice rather than their ""interest."" These reasons make it difficult for these students to practice career tasks, or avail necessary social support when encountering career difficulties. Two deficiencies are concluded in disadvantaged students' career dilemma: lack of knowledge about career planning, and not knowing how to plan their own career. From the perspective of social justice, every student, especially those with disadvantaged career development, should have equal opportunities to use career services suitable for them, so as to strengthen their ability to reduce the negative impact of social inequality and develop their own life stories. The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate a peer support career service program for underprivileged youth with career difficulties. This is an action research study that uses both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The career service program has 14 units, including meet and greet, growth review, self-exploration, reading and learning strategies, strengths integration, data search and application, major department and career exploration, goal setting, decision-making, resume production, time management, action plan, and blessings. The design of this study combines the teaching nature of career education with the counseling nature of career guidance. In terms of career education, pre-service teachers play the role of experts who guide and explain the concept and method of career planning, and design teaching plans based on the needs of disadvantaged students to enhance their career planning knowledge. In the guidance aspect, emphasis is placed on personal career obstacles. Pre-service teachers act as catalysts and guides who accompany disadvantaged students in self-exploration and development of career planning skills. This study adopted an amoeba-style design, emphasizing adjusting the proportion and method of career education and career guidance according to the needs and reactions of each student. Working with two non-profit organizations, 25 participants were included in-person in a one-on-one service. The average time for which each participant used the service was 10.76 hours (1 hour per session). The data were analyzed through repeated measures analysis. The results showed significant differences in goal selection, self-evaluation, problem solving, planning, data collection, career self-efficacy, career concern, career curiosity, and career adaptability domains. However, there was no significant difference in career control and career confidence, although there was an improvement. In addition, the results of the follow-up interviews showed that participants held a positive attitude (90.64 on a 0–100 scale) toward the program and considered that the program helped them understand themselves, their department and work, and to find their future direction. In addition, participants also stated that peer support was similar to friend-to-friend support, making it easier for them to build relationships with each other. Research recommendations include promoting and extending the peer support career service mode to more disadvantaged youths, continuing to develop differentiated career service strategies and skills, forming a career service community in cooperation with universities and institutions, exploring the influence of pre-service teachers in helping disadvantaged students in their career planning, and observing the impact on disadvantaged students' future education and employment. In addition, it is also recommended to compare the effectiveness of using peer support career services with that of taking career courses in senior high schools.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-N202301310017-00003,66,2023,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Effectiveness of Culture-specific Psychodrama on Changing Group Participants’ Parent-child Interactions Regarding Filial Piety,"Nien-Hwa Lai, Yu-Cheng Chang, Ta-Hung Wei, Che-En Chang","Adult parent-child relationship, psychodrama, indigenous counseling psychology, filial piety","This study investigated the effectiveness of culture-specific psychodrama on changing participants' parent-child interactions regarding filial piety. A focused group interview was conducted with master's students who participated in an ongoing psychodrama group lasting 17 weeks. A qualitative analysis of the interview yielded the following results. First, adult children experienced difficulties in five areas of parent-child interactions: (1) parents' hierarchical disciplinary attitudes, (2) parents' emotional and behavioral problems, (3) spousal issues between parents, (4) the pressures accompanying the responsibility of caring for parents, and (5) parents' ardent expectations of the children. Second, five positions were noted in response to these difficulties: (1) strenuous efforts for maintaining harmony in the face of family conflicts; (2) suppression of inner conflicts that accompanied the responsibilities in the role of a child, (3) being trapped in the pain inflicted by parents' past behaviors, (4) avoiding interactions and becoming emotionally withdrawn, and (5) anger and self-blame resulting from direct conflicts. Third, six changes were brought about by culture-specific psychodrama: (1) gaining awareness and accepting one's own feelings, (2) clarifying the impact of painful past experiences, (3) gaining clarity of boundaries regarding their sense of responsibility in their tense relationships, (4) showing deep and comprehensive understanding of parents' cultural backgrounds, (5) becoming more flexible when conflicts arise in the relationship, and (6) increasing emotional interactions between the parents and children. Based on these results, we discussed the inner conflicts experienced by children belonging toin this culture, as well as the children's growing understanding of the sociocultural landscape delineated by culture-specific psychodrama and its effectiveness on changing the parent-child relationship.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-N202301310017-00004,66,2023,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"When I'm ＂Good＂, You Should Watch Out: Computerized Text Analysis of Linguistic Trajectory of Sexual Re-Offense","Chien Huang, Tzu-Ying Wu, Yen-Lin Huang","re-offense, Community treatment, linguistic trajectory, text analysis, sexual assault","According to the current legal system in Taiwan, sex offenders must enter a community intervention program after being released from prison. However, recent research of sex offenders has suggested that over the longer term after offenders are released, they have a high rate of sexual re-offense. This shows that the daily struggles while returning to society might contribute to sexual re-offense in different ways, so as to impact the risk factor of sexual re-offense. Thus, assessing the re-offense attempts of sex offenders in the community intervention program is worthy of attention in clinical practice. However, considering the importance of monitoring linguistic behaviors, there is very little existing research that has empirically documented the language use of sex offenders and how that may impact recidivism of sexual offense. Therefore, the aim of this case report attempts to explore how sex offenders' state of minds are reflected in daily language use and how linguistic markers and sexual re-offense may be related. Pennebaker and his colleagues have provided excellent reviews of the psychological aspect in language use. They believe that either expressive writing or spoken language demonstrate cognitive reflective models. Instead of focusing on ＂what＂ is said by the individuals, paying attention to ＂how＂ the individuals say it is much more crucial. Furthermore, it opened a window for researchers to analyze the psychological vulnerabilities or risks of sex offenders as well as having further understanding of the underlining altered state of mind that is intertwined with the surroundings. Considering these concerns, this case study involved a biweekly log written by an ex-sex offender in a community intervention program. The time frame for the study lasted nearly one year until the re-offense occurred. A total of twenty-one free-writing diaries were analyzed with a computerized text analysis software, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Beyond examining several categories of words with psychological meanings, such as negative and positive affect, this case study also applies higher-order algorithms based on LIWC dictionaries, including the index of complex thinking, the index of honesty, and the index of social-emotional style. Considering months as the analysis unit, the one-year period is divided into the initial stage (April to July), incubation stage (August to December) and action stage (January to March). The results suggested that the language style could possibly indicate signs of recidivism for sex offenders over the long-term while recording their thoughts. The language used during the action stage demonstrated four valuable language shifts compared to other stages. First, the total number of words continually decreased over time. Second, positive affect words decreased and negative affect words increased. Third, the index of complex thinking decreased. Fourth, the index of honesty rose with a V-shape. This result is aligned with the inference of the deception theory of Ekman, Vrij, and DePaulo. To conclude, the study may be of importance in explaining language with psychological meaning that could reflect subtle changes in hidden intention of crimes. In addition, the findings of the study also have implications for observing signs of deception and the subsequent re-offense from the written text. Thus, language analysis is proving to be a useful source for conducting psychological evaluation and risk management for sex offenders who under treatment. That said, the generalization of the results to other populations with different backgrounds may be limited, so more research is called for to expand the understanding of the language style of sex offenders.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202209-202210030007-202210030007-1-25,65,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Process of Ethical Judgment on Multi-Role Conflicts of High School Counselors in Chinese Cultural Context,"Ya-Yu Cheng, Su-Hui Chang, Jin-Fong Chuang, Chih-Hung Wang","Chinese culture, senior high school, multiple roles conflict, ethical judgment process, school counselors","School counseling plays an important role as the problems that high school students face become more complex. However, there are many challenging ethical situations on school grounds nowadays. Particularly, school counselors frequently confront complex ethical dilemmas that often involve relationships with principals, parents, and other stakeholders. In interacting with different people, school counselors must play various roles involving ethical issues. In Taiwanese high schools currently, school counselors must play multiple roles at the same time, including as educators, counselors, administrators, and so on. The potential for conflict in these situations can be exacerbated by differences in the roles and responsibilities of personnel within the school. Furthermore, unlike Western cultures that value individualism, Chinese culture is strongly influenced by the relationship network society. Therefore, playing multiple roles towards students is more likely to face ethical issues in Chinese culture. Based on the nature and characteristics of Chinese society, the ethical issue of multiple relationships is more complicated in Chinese culture. Hence, this study aims to explore the process of ethical judgment on multi-role conflicts encountered by high school counselors. Ethical judgment involves personal experiences, such as mental health struggles, ethical values, action decisions, adjustment strategies, reflection, etc. Therefore, the current study employed an exploratory, qualitative research design to assess the experiences and perceptions of participants. The study data was collected from the interviews of five participants working in senior high schools for at least three years. This study employed purposive sampling methods to find school counselors for the interviews. All participants indicated their interest in the study by providing their names and signing research consent. The data analysis was conducted with Template Analysis Style, which is a method of thematic analysis that has been applied in a broad range of research areas in the social sciences. Regarding the results, participants' experiences of the ethical judgment process were divided into four stages, including the conflict stage, decision stage, action stage, and influence stage. Initially, the first stage was identified as the conflict stage. High school counselors encountered: (1) the conflict of different responsibilities among multiple roles, (2) the conflict between clients' well-being and administrative requirements, and (3) the conflict between professional expectations and interpersonal needs. In the decision stage, the main considerations included: (1) the best welfare of clients, (2) considering the administrative ethics in a school organization, and (3) the influence of Chinese interpersonal interaction. In the action stage, the current study indicated that high school counselors would take four strategies in the ethical dilemma: (1) clarifying professional responsibilities of school counselors, (2) seeking professional supervisors' assistance or consulting senior colleagues, (3) applying for external resources to reduce the ethical dilemma, and (4) adjusting self-expectations to meet the needs of the situation. The influence stage refers to the impact of ethical dilemmas for high school counselors. According to the result of the study, this stage showed that (1) participants would rethink the professional role of high school counselors, (2) they would adjust inadaptation and accept role restrictions, and (3) they would reflect on the results of the conflict and reconstruct ethical attitudes. Based on the results of the current study, relevant recommendations were proposed: (1) encouraging high school counselors to examine their criteria for making ethical judgments, (2) enhancing the awareness of indigenous psychology in ethical education, and (3) establishing a system of professional supervisors for high school counselors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202209-202210030007-202210030007-27-62,65,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Teachers' Perceptions of the Implementation of the Bullying Prevention Policies in Taiwan,"Ada L. Sinacore, Shu-Chu Chao, Jennifer Ho, Shaofan Bu","bullying prevention, guidance teachers, school climate, Anti-bullying policy","Taiwan enforced the Regulations on the Prevention of Bullying on Campus policy in 2012 and was the first East Asian country to enforce a national policy that addresses bullying in schools. Employing a mixed-method design, this study investigated teacher's and administrative staff's perceptions and experiences of anti-bullying policy implementation. A total of 116 teachers and administrative staff participated in the survey and 15 teachers and administrative staff participated in interviews. The results indicated that a lack of anti-bullying education for teachers coupled with endemic heterosexism perpetuated school climates that prioritized improving students' academic performance over implementing anti-bullying policies. The important role of teachers in policy implementation as well as school principal's commitment to addressing school bullying were highlighted as key in reducing bullying behaviors.

Narrative as Metaphor: Inquiry on the Effects of Metaphors in Narrative Paradigms,"Jui-Ping Hung, Ming-Yu Deng","poem, narrative, the truth of metaphor, mimesis, Metaphor","This study addresses the key effects and meanings of metaphors in narrative studies and narrative psychology. Metaphors have importance in the development of hermeneutics, and Ricoeur studied it in the book La métaphore vive. The development of hermeneutics has two major turns. The first major turn is Wilhelm Dilthey's contributions, who made important contributions to a methodology of the humanities and other human sciences. The second major turn is that Martin Heidegger's contributions, shifted from Wilhelm Dilthey's theories. Martin Heidegger is counted among the main exponents of existentialism. Heidegger's groundbreaking work is in ontology (the philosophical study of being or existence) and metaphysics. And since then, hermeneutics has advocated detours to understand human beings that requires language or narrative text. The role of metaphors in the narrative is what this study aims to explore. The literature as well as practical counseling experiences have found different schools of counseling seem to believe that metaphors help the process of counseling. The purpose of this study is to explore how metaphors help.Also, the main approach of this study is to explore the links and important discourses between narratives and metaphors in greater depth through the review of critical literatures. The study explores how metaphors help step by step from how metaphors are applied, and from the methodology aspect, the epistemology aspect and the ontology aspect. When it comes to how metaphors are applied, metaphors stimulate transformation in reference frames, viewpoints of world, and the naming of the externalized problems, etc. In this study, metaphors stimulate the study participants to reflect on stories holistically and improve the consistency of interpretation. The role of metaphors comes from what Ricoeur called a rhetorical property. At the methodology level, metaphors have what Ricoeur called poetics, including mimesis and pictorial-semantic fusion. Therefore, metaphors stimulate the transformation process of pre-figuration, configuration, and re-figuration of Ricoeur's ＂threefold mimesis＂, which are the core frame of narrative, in the text. Also, the pictorial nature of metaphors assist in the construction and interpretation of the story. At the epistemological level, metaphors themselves contain a dialectical epistemology of ＂to be＂ and ＂not to be＂, and this dialectic helps to promote the hermeneutic circle among understanding, interpretation, and construction. It is an open circle and a creative mimesis. Finally, at the ontology level, metaphors reveal the ontological characteristics of the human beings' world - the ＂as if＂ world. This world can only be drawn up by metaphors or narrative texts. However, the difference (écart) of the texts is not regarded as an error but rather regarded as a type of creativity and liveliness of the text. Moreover, the secondary reference of metaphors and narratives, the hermeneutical detour nature of narratives, helps people move from a limited situation of unformed meaning towards a state of existence and authentic self. In other words, the ontology or existence of man reflected in metaphors or narratives is essentially the ontology of meaning construction. The so-called authentic self (Eigentlichkeit) or transcendent state is not the appearance of the real self or the given ultimate goal or answer but rather a possibility of development and a process of continuous meaning construction and becoming. In the history the earliest narrative works of human beings are cave paintings of primitive humans and related witchcraft rituals or dances. The initial imitations of these life experiences have brought about reflection and consciousness, which allows human beings to go into the world of meaning construction from the unconscious and organic world. This also allows for the birth of art and culture. Therefore, human beings are in this metaphorical and narrative-like world and can constantly construct or reconstruct meanings of life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202209-202210030007-202210030007-93-126,65,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Promotion and Evaluation of the Marriage Education Program in Taiwan: A Case of the ＂Holding Hands＂ Family Program,"Ying-Ling Hsiao, Tsui-Shan Li","Taiwanese couples, marriage education","Context and Object: The ＂Holding Hands＂ family program is a marriage education program that focuses on interactional characteristics of Taiwanese couples, emphasizes the enjoyability of shared activities, and pays attention to individual privacy and differences between husband and wife. The purpose of this study is twofold: (1) to evaluate the ＂Holding Hands＂ family program across four major characteristics: localization, enjoyability, privacy, and professionalism; (2) to assess the effects of the ＂Holding Hands＂ family program in enriching marital relationships. Method: Survey, focus groups, and individual interviews were employed to collect relevant data in this study. The survey included items for examining the degree of learning and satisfaction that couples felt towards the program. It also investigated changes in the quality of marriage before and after couples participated in the program. Focus groups and individual interviews were used to understand the feelings of the couples towards the characteristics of the program and to explore the processes of how marital relationships improve over time. A total of 17 couples participated in the program and completed the questionnaire. Seven couples participated in focus groups or in-depth interviews. Results: In evaluating this program, 78% of participants felt that the interaction method they learned was suitable for Taiwanese couples, showing the localization of the program; 89% of participants found the activities to be entertaining, showing the enjoyability of the program; 77% of participants were satisfied that the program provided alone time for couples, demonstrating the privacy of the program; and 78% of participants acquired professional knowledge about marriage, reflecting the professionalism of the program. In assessing the impact of this program, the results showed that among seven couples who completed pretest and posttest questionnaires, three couples' marital quality increased over time, three couples showed different patterns between husbands and wives in marital quality changes (one's marital quality increased and the other's marital quality decreased), and one couple's marital quality remained the same as before. It seemed that the program had the effect of revitalizing the partnership for most of the participants. How exactly did the ＂Holding Hands＂ family program enrich the relationship between husband and wife? The qualitative findings showed that this marital education program promoted marital quality by designing courses that (1) allowed the couples to realize what was previously overlooked and to understand each other better, (2) generated new perspectives on relationship development and rethought the meanings behind their spousal behaviors, and (3) allowed for couples to change their thoughts and then adjust their approaches. Conclusion and Suggestions: This program achieved breakthroughs and demonstrated strength across the four major characteristics. The program also provided activities for couples' children to enable couples to participate. By emphasizing enjoyability and privacy, the program appealed to participants in various groups and genders. The concepts for this program were all derived from the results of localized research, which was tailored to the life experiences and ways of communications among Taiwanese couples. Future marriage education research may consider combining activities with the husband and wife, children, and even the whole family, which should increase couples' participation and acceptance of marriage education. To promote future marriage education, government and non-governmental organizations can combine resources from the industry, government, and academia sources to examine the effect of marriage education currently implemented in Taiwan, understand the main mechanism by which marriage education improves marital relationship, and explore the applicability of marriage education programs to couples at different phases of family life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202205-202205310005-202205310005-1-34,64,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
A Pilot Study of the Psychological Impact of the Anti-Same Sex Marriage Campaigns in the Marriage Equality Referendum on Gay People Living with HIV/AIDS in Taiwan,Chun-Mei Tsai,"person living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), same sex marriage, Marriage Equality referendum, self-stigma, AIDS-discrimination","Context and Objective: On May 24, 2019, Taiwan becomes the first country in Asia to legalize same sex marriage. However, many supporters felt disappointed by the referendum on marriage equality that took place on November 24, 2018. Marriage equality was discussed in Taiwan before the referendum, which entailed many public hearings and debates. There were alliances opposing same sex marriage (referred to as ＂anti-same sex marriage groups＂), as well as alliance that supported same sex marriage. During these debates, anti-same-sex marriage groups highlighted HIV/AIDS issues as justification for opposing same-sex marriage with arguments that included, ＂most people infected with HIV are gay＂, ＂gay sex among men is the primary factor in HIV transmission＂, ＂ legalizing same sex marriage will cause the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic＂, ＂Taiwan will become an HIV/AIDS island＂, ＂The cost of HIV/AIDS treatment will consume medical resources,＂ and ＂Taiwan should not provide health care benefits to those who got HIV/AIDS.＂ Internet and social media outlets have promoted numerous negative messages about HIV/AIDS, and the anti-same-sex marriage group still uses ＂HIV/AIDS＂ as a reason to repeatedly attack the gay community. The present research aims to understand the psychological impact of negative HIV/AIDS propaganda on gay men living with HIV/AIDS in Taiwan and how they coped during the marriage equality referendum. Methods: We first collected articles, pictures, videos, and news about anti-same-sex marriage justification for discrimination against HIV/AIDS from websites, social media, and mobile APP. We then recruited focus group participants through AIDS service for non-governmental organizations. On the day of the focus group in April 2019, we made a brief presentation on relevant negative propaganda before conducting the 2.5 hours focus group. We then conducted a qualitative content analysis after the verbatim transcript was created. The average age of the eight interviewees was 38.75, and the average years of HIV infection was 11 years. All participants were taking HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy). The interviewees all stated that they had received negative propaganda messages about AIDS on social media during the marriage equality referendum promotion period. Results: (1) Respondents will make fun of the content of the propaganda, or feel bored and angry. In response, they will avoid, be objective and calm, or take the initiative to educate those around them. (2) Ways to respond to negative propaganda messages: somebody would avoid, disregarded, and simply ignore it; somebody would aim and calm, or somebody would actively educate other people around them. (3) There are three dilemmas: (a) They do not want to have conversations with anti-same sex marriage group that distribute the AIDS-stigma messages and instead look forward to clarification by officials (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control) and other powerful non-government organization; (b) Interviewees do not want to hurt other vulnerable groups during the process that messages are clarified; (c) They are worried about affecting the public's perception of the gay community or being separated from the gay community. (4) For HIV/AIDS anti-discrimination advocacy recommendations, the effectiveness of HAART treatment should be strengthened, the official classification of HIV/AIDS statistics should be revised, and vulnerable groups that are friendly to HIV/AIDS should be invited to form alliances. (5) In particular, some of their family members began to discuss homosexuality issues, making the interviewee feel accepted, but it was still not easy to show up as a PLWHA. Discussion and Conclusion: Based on the research results, this study suggests: (1) Self-stigma is deeply rooted in PLWHA; (2) Public antidiscrimination education for HIV/AIDS needs to be promoted as soon as possible, especially on HAART treatment effects. Gay men with HIV/AIDS are discriminated against HIV/AIDS in the marriage equality referendum, and they are caught in a situation that includes both self-stigma and external discrimination.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202205-202205310005-202205310005-35-63,64,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Effect of Positive and Negative Marital Quality on Couples' Marital Self-Concept and Familial Self-Concept: An Analysis of the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model,"Chih-Wen Wu, Szu-Chia Chang","familial self-concept, positive marital quality, negative marital quality, Actor-partner interdependence model, marital self-concept","Context and Objectives: Marriage brings many challenges, which require careful management and adjustment by both spouses. One of the noteworthy challenges is that individuals will start to view themselves in different ways. During the newlywed period, the self-concepts corresponding to the couple's new role of spouse and family group members will be developed. As a spouse in a marital relationship, Chinese couples' marital self-concept (MSC) represents their relationship-oriented self-construal to have mutual love and support with their spouses and maintain a harmonious interaction in their relationship. As a member of both the original family and in-law family, Chinese couples' familial self-concept (FSC) represents their group-oriented self-construal to honor their families, reach consensus among family members, and achieve the goals of all their family members. Even though the self-concept has an important effect on couples' marital adaptation, research on how the marriage couples' self-concepts would be reconstructed is scarce. Because one's self-concept would be reconstructed by life experience, the purpose of this study is to investigate how marriage life influences Chinese couples' MSC and FSC in the early stage of marriage. Considering that positive and negative self-involved experiences could drive dissimilar mechanisms, this study attempts to explore the specific effect of positive and negative marital quality. Then, based on the nature of interdependence between marriage couples, this study also uses the actor-partner interdependence model to further explore the actor effect and partner effect between husbands and wives. Method: This study conducted two waves of follow-up surveys separated by a 2-year lag and collected a total of 93 valid dyad-data from couples living in the north (n = 53), middle (n = 11), south (n = 20), and east regions of Taiwan (n = 9). The average length of marriage at the first wave was 1.30 years (SD = 0.68 years), and the average age of the husband and wife were 31.46 years old (SD = 3.51 years) and 29.89 years old (SD = 2.84 years), respectively. This study used structural equation modeling to analyze two hypothetical actor-partner interdependence models. Results: The first model investigated the actor- and partner-effect of positive marital quality on couples' MSC and FSC and showed acceptable model fit (χ^2 = 264.16; df = 204; p = .003; χ^2/df = 1.29; CFI = .93; TLI = .91; RMSEA = .056; SRMR = .052). The actor-effects of husbands' and wives' positive marital quality was positively significant on their own MSC (husbands: γ_(11) = .50, SE = 0.11, p ＜ .001; wives: γ_(32) = .55, SE = 0.12, p ＜ .001) and FSC (husbands: γ_(21) = .33, SE = 0.12, p = .007; wives: γ_(42) = .27, SE = 0.13, p = .034). The partner-effect of wives' positive marital quality was positively significant on husbands' MSC (γ_(12) = .24, SE = 0.12, p = .036), and the other partner-effects were non-significant. The second model investigated the actor- and partner-effect of negative marital quality and also showed acceptable model fit (χ^2 = 253.49; df = 204; p = .011; χ^2/df = 1.24; CFI = .93; TLI = .91; RMSEA = .051; SRMR = .059). The actor-effect and the partner-effect of husbands' negative marital quality were non-significant on their own and with wives' MSC and FSC. However, the actor-effect and the partner-effect of wives' negative marital quality were negatively significant on their own and with husbands' MSC (actor-effect: γ_(32) = -.53, SE = 0.14, p ＜ .001; partner-effect: γ_(12) = -.48, SE = 0.15, p = .001) and FSC (actor-effect: γ_(42) = -.42, SE = 0.14, p = .003; partner-effect: γ_(22) = -.35, SE = 0.15, p = .025). Discussion and Conclusion: This study highlighted that positive and negative marital quality in the early stage of marriage can shape and restructure Chinese couples' self-identification as a spouse and a family group member. Additionally, husbands' and wives' marriage life experiences can have different influences on their own and their partners' self-concepts. Particularly, the wives' both positive and negative marital qualities have impressive impacts on shaping their own and their husbands' marital and familial self-concept. The limitation of sampling bias and its influences on the current results are discussed, and the understanding of the detailed mechanism linking positive and negative marital quality to Chinese couples' self-concept is still very limited and requires further exploration and more attention. These findings might be of importance in providing professional consultants and family life educators a better understanding of how Chinese couples' marital and familial self-concept will be affected by their life experiences in the early stage of marriage.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202205-202205310005-202205310005-65-97,64,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Revision and Validity Test for Experimental Tasks Related to Risky Social Decision-Making,Chung-Chin Wu,"Columbia Card Task, social reward, risky decision making, social reference, multilevel confirmatory factor analysis","Risky decisions increase with age and reach peaks in adolescence and early adulthood before declining again during adulthood. Although risky decisions are commonly made by adolescents, it may have long-term negative impacts on life later. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), proposed about three decades ago, is the most common task used to investigate risky decision-making. It was developed based on the somatic marker hypothesis, which assumed that individuals' behaviors are implicitly influenced by reward and punishment experiences, and these experiences would send emotional information to drive individuals' decision-making behaviors toward beneficial long-term directions. However, only the emotional decision-making process was addressed in IGT, which may not sufficiently account for adolescents' risky decision processes. Recently, cognitive neuroscience research suggested that risky decision-making involves two systems in the brain. Risky decision-making increases between childhood and adolescence as a result of changes around the time of puberty of the brain's socio-emotional system that leads to increased reward-seeking, especially when peers are present. The socio-emotional system has been shown to rely on the ventral tegmentum area, subcortical structures (ventral striatum and amygdala) and cortical structures (the insular and medial/orbital frontal cortex). This system is operated automatically based on similarity and contiguity, and behavior is influenced by emotional impulse. Risky decision-making decreases between adolescence and adulthood because of changes in the brain's cognitive-control system - changes which improve individuals' ability for self-control, which occur gradually and over the course of adolescence and young adulthood. The cognitive-control system is assumed to rely on the dorsal and ventral area of the lateral prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex. The differing timetables of these two brain systems make mid-adolescence a time of heightened vulnerability to make risky decisions. Consequently, researchers tended to argue that biased behavioral decision making was due to an imbalance between emotion and cognition processes. The Columbia Card Task (CCT) was proposed to measure individuals' emotion and cognition processes in decision making. However, the construct validity of this measurement was unclear, and it was not only complex and time-consuming in the implementation of the original task design but also considered the changes of scores instead of including the effects of social factors (i.e., peers and social reward) on decision making processes. The main purpose of this study was referring and revising (simplifying) the original design of CCT and adding other tasks that incorporated social reference of peers' decisions and social rewards of recognition into a revised CCT task to evaluate the construct validity of this social risky decision-making task. There were 269 eighth graders who consented to participate in this study, and multilevel confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to take into account nesting structure. The results showed: (1) The original design of CCT with minor revisions (reducing decision options from three to two) was effective in eliciting emotion and cognition processes. (2) Simplified CCT tasks incorporating social factors were also effective in eliciting the effects of social reference and social reward. (3) The social risky decision-making task held good construct validity. Future studies are encouraged to utilize this measurement to understand the effects of adolescents' risky decision-making on cognition and behavior. For guidance and counseling practices, it is encouraged to understand the extent of risky decision-making for adolescents through present tasks to identify adolescents who are vulnerable to make risky decisions as early as possible and to regularly show care and help through guidance and counseling. Moreover, clarifying which adolescents are more likely to make risky decisions because of the presence of peers or social rewards helps to understand the potential impacts of risky decisions under different decision conditions. This study is beneficial for guidance and counseling practitioners to provide more precise interventions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202205-202205310005-202205310005-99-129,64,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Studying the Parent-adolescent Interaction Experiences in a Taiwanese-Indonesian Transnational Marriage Family: A Case Study,"Yi-Wei Chen, Yi-Han Wang","Southeast Asian transnational marriage family, new resident, Taiwanese-Indonesian transnational marriage, parent-adolescent interaction experiences, Adolescent","The educational and upbringing experiences of transnational marriages between Taiwan and Southeast Asian countries have always been the focus of academics and helping professions in Taiwan. As children grow up to adolescence, the parent-adolescent interaction of these families is a topic that needs to be discussed. The purpose of this study was to explore parent-adolescent interaction experiences in a Southeast Asian transnational marriage family in Taiwan, including upbringing, coparenting and cross-cultural experiences. This study selected one Taiwanese-Indonesian transnational marriage family as a case, and semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with all family members, including parents and adolescents. The results are as followed: (1) Upbringing experiences: Parents had gradually changed their upbringing strategies when children grew up to adolescence-from strict disciplines to self-management. The division of parenting work ＂the father is responsible for family economy; the mother is in charge of care work＂ was the main upbringing strategy in the daily life or schoolwork. Also, as children grew up to adolescence and accepted school education, the discrepancy of Chinese speaking ability between Indonesian new resident mother and adolescents influenced their interactions. In other words, adolescents showed better Chinese speaking ability than Indonesian mother, and this difference in language proficiency not only overturned Indonesian mother's upbringing role but also affected her parenting authority, especially when quarrels appeared between mother and adolescents. (2) Coparenting experiences: Gender division of housework ＂male leads outside; female leads inside＂ was the pattern of parenting practice in this family. Indonesian mother was the main executor in parenting, but in order to facilitate the interaction between Taiwanese father and adolescents, she used her strategies positively, pulling father into parenting alliance. Also, affected unconsciously by ideology of patriarchy and thought of ＂the father is responsible for family economy＂, Indonesian mother intended to respect her husband in some crucial parenting decision-making, especially when it came to paying money. (3) Cross-cultural experiences: In this case, Indonesian mother had ethnic Chinese background, so all the family members felt few cross-cultural differences. But when Indonesian mother tried to teach some easy Indonesian words or sentences for her daughter and son at their very young age, it still showed parenting authority discrepancies between Taiwanese father and Indonesian mother-that was, Indonesian mother's native language was not accepted by Taiwanese father at the beginning. However, as pivotal opportunities appeared, like new resident culture courses in school, Indonesian language learning chance brought by Indonesian mother's relatives and adolescents going back to Indonesia with mother to learn Indonesian cultures through practice, Indonesian mother's native culture began to be taught in parent-adolescent interactions. Based on study results, two findings are as followed: (1) With related conditions such as co-parenting consensus, positive acts and cooperation of parents, good use of cross-cultural similarities, and acceptance of differences, it could form positive dynamic system and benefit parent-adolescent interaction in Southeast Asian transnational marriage families. (2) Due to the influence of gender culture and because Taiwanese father was the role of household maintenance and was familiar with local educational system, the phenomenon that new resident mother spent more time in parenting but Taiwanese father was the main decision maker and the career consultant became more obvious as children grew up to adolescence. Suggestions for counseling practices are also elaborated according to this study: (1) Counselors are suggested to give attention to how those different systems and factors bring positive influences to Taiwanese- Indonesian transnational marriage families. (2) Counselors are suggested to be sensitive to hidden power issues in Taiwanese-Indonesian transnational marriage families. (3) Related information and knowledge about Southeast Asian transnational marriage families are necessary for counselors. Also, counselors are suggested to inspect their own values and take good use of family system perspectives when conceptualizing clients or families.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202201-202202080018-202202080018-1-34,63,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
No Progress Leads to Abandonment: The Research on Learning Problems of At-Risk Students in Junior High School,James Feng-Chien Lee,"At-risk students, school learning, junior high school, deviant behaviors, third space theory","At-risk students have more problems of learning in schools that might lead to delinquent behaviors and drop-out. It is important to find out their difficulties in learning in schools and let at-risk students receive suitable schooling. The research purposes are to investigate the identity and their formation based on the third space theory. This approach could reflect the school systems which would obstruct learning of at-risk students from their coping attitudes. Ten at-risk students who had delinquent behaviors were chosen from three Multiple Classes in a junior high school in Taipei. The school has better high school entrance performance. Multiple Classes teaching various activities but academy are designed for delinquent students who are not able to stay in regular classroom to learn. Classes include gardening, dance and navigation related activites. Research methods are individual in-depth interview and non-participatory observation. Interviewees were students, one teacher from each of the three Multiple Classes and Section Chief of Counseling in school. Observation was conducted in each of the three Multiple Classes using video recording and field diary. Data were analyzed by hermeneutic phenomenology approach. Interviews with student were the primary data, and interviews with teachers and class observation served as triangulation. After all cases were analyzed individually, cross cases analysis followed. The results find the identity of at-risk students is to quit learning, and four students identified themselves as to playaround. Regarding identity formation, they bear huge pressure from learning with lots of negative emotions which results from not understanding what they are taught. These emotions led to their delinquency behaviors and marginalization in class, cut classes or even flunk out. Avoiding, giving up, resisting and spontaneous reaction were used by these students to cope with pressure in school. These attitudes relating to misbehaviors can not relieve their difficulties, but form a feedback loop that impeded student learning in the school systems. These school systems are academic curriculum, one-size-fits-all curriculum schedule and tests, and whole class instruction. The loop keeps them from learning, getting harder to follow up classes and even staying away from schools. Class delinquency of students often led to disciplinary actions which worsened teacher-student relationship and their attitude toward the teachers' classes. Even the relationship is fair, it does not mean to support their learning. Additionally, at-risk students lack of classmates to support their learning after quit learning because common activities of classmates are about learning. If they escape from learning to play around, they spend more time on play and created a vicious circle of low school. Their parents are commonly unfamiliar with their friends frequently hanging on. If they have friends to do with gangsters, they would act more delinquent behaviors and even rebel against their family rules. The contributions of this research are in two perspectives. From research approach perspective, this research adopts third space theory to explore at-risk students learning problems in school. It not only reveals huge pressure experiences by at-risk students in learning but also the school systems that are disadvantageous to their learning. The at-risk student is the title labelled from the authority of school system taking them as different. From practical perspective, the results depict extremely embarrassed situations of at-risk students in learning. Education policy makers and school administrators should adjust the systems to be more flexible and fit better students' learning conditions. Teachers and consultants should be more sensitive to identifying their explicit delinquent behaviors and interpret such behaviors not as violating rules intentionally but as a warning of their learning difficulties and assist them to overcome.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202201-202202080018-202202080018-35-70,63,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"The Impact of Self-Esteem, Parent-Child and Teacher-Student Relationships on Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms from Adolescence to Emerging Adulthood","Yi-Rou Chen, Wei-Ming Luh","Depressive symptoms, Taiwan Youth Project, self-esteem, teacher-student relationship, parent-child relationship","Depression is an increasingly important area in psychology and education. Investigating depressive symptoms is a continuing concern for adolescents. Recently, an increased interest extends to emerging adulthood. According to the viewpoint of ecological system theory, previous studies in process-person-context-time model have highlighted the important factors such as ideal self, parent-child relationship, teacher-student relationship. This study aimed to investigate the trajectories of depressive symptoms from adolescence to emerging adulthood by considering three predictors - self-esteem, parent-child, and teacher-student relationships. Using AMOS 23.0, two factor latent growth curve model with random intercepts and random slopes was used to analyze the longitudinal data. In this panel study, a sample of 992 students were selected from the Taiwan Youth Project (TYP) in three waves from 2002 to 2009 (at Grade 9, Grade 12, and the senior year of undergraduate). The average scores in each of the three waves served as indicators of latent intercepts and slopes for each of the four study variables. By using hierarchical cluster analysis with dendrogram, we were able to divide all subjects into two groups as low and high depressive symptom groups respectively. Four research questions with correspondent eleven research hypotheses were investigated. That is, H1a: The intercept of self-esteem has negative influence on the correspondent slope of self-esteem. H1b: The intercept of parent-child relationship has negative influence on the correspondent slope of parent-child relationship. H1c: The intercept of teacher-student relationships has negative influence on the correspondent slope of teacher-student relationships. H2a: The intercept of self-esteem has negative influence on the intercept of depressive symptoms. H2b: The intercept of self-esteem has negative influence on the slope of depressive symptoms. H2c: The slope of self-esteem has negative influence on the slope of depressive symptoms. H3a: The intercept of parent-child relationship has negative influence on the intercept of depressive symptoms. H3b: The slope of parent-child relationship has negative influence on the slope of depressive symptoms. H4a: The intercept of teacher-student relationships has negative influence on the intercept of depressive symptoms. H4b: The intercept of teacher-student relationships has negative influence on the slope of depressive symptoms. H4c: The slope of teacher-student relationships has negative influence on the slope of depressive symptoms. The main findings of this study are shown as follows: (1) The intercepts of self-esteem, parent-child, and teacher-student relationships all negatively affected their respective slopes. In addition, the intercepts of the high depressive group on these three variables were lower, and the slopes were greater, than those of low depressive group. (2) Among the three predictors, self-esteem was the most important one. The intercept of self-esteem affected the intercept of depressive symptoms; the slope in self-esteem also affected the slope in depressive symptoms in both groups. Surprisingly, in the high depressive symptom group, people with high self-esteem in Grade 9 had a higher positive depressive symptom slope in the future. (3) The intercept of parent-child relationship negatively affected the intercept of depressive symptoms for the low depressive symptom group, while the slope in parent-child relationship affected the slope in depressive symptoms for the high depressive group. (4) The intercept of the teacher-student relationship negatively affected the intercept of depression symptoms only in the low depressive symptom group. Based on these results, suggestions for practical applications and future research are also discussed. In brief, it is necessary to pay attention to students' development of long-term self-esteem and other psychological and social factors even if an individual has good self-esteem from the beginning. It is worth noting that individuals with high self-esteem are likely to have greater changes in depressive symptoms in the future. If an individual has high self-esteem but cannot tolerate setbacks and failures, the slope in depressive symptoms will increase. Moreover, even if individuals have unfavorable family experiences in the early stages, they still have the possibility of improving parent-child relationships, showing that the parent-child relationship is not limited to a single point in time. Finally, the teacher-student relationship in early adolescence not only shows its long-term influence, but also becomes an individual's protective factor for depression, helping individual to have better adaptability in future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202201-202202080018-202202080018-71-109,63,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Preliminary Study on the Influence of Professional Guidance Counselors Manpower Increase on the College Counseling Work,"Fei-Chuan Chen, Yih-Fen Chen, Kai-Wei Ho","professional guidance counselors, College counseling work","After the ＂Student Guidance and Counseling Act＂ was enacted in 2014 in Taiwan, the Ministry of Education has provided funding to subsidize public and private colleges and universities for hiring full-time and part-time professional guidance counselors (Clinical Psychologist, Counseling Psychologist, & Social worker) to provide mental health service to students. In the process of promoting this important educational policy, it is important to assess how the increase of professional staff has impacted manpower allocation, organizational changes, school counseling work and effectiveness, and future feasible actions for college counseling work. The purpose of the study was to explore the effectiveness of the recruitment of full-time and part-time counselors in colleges and universities, as well as the impact of school counseling. The data were derived from responses of 122 public and private colleges and universities to the Ministry of Education's self-evaluation forms. In addition, 40 college counseling center directors and deans of Student Affairs were invited to participate in focus group discussion. Also, presidents and vice presidents of three colleges and universities were interviewed individually in depth to examine the effectiveness of full-time and part-time professional guidance counselors, and their impact on college counseling. The research findings are: (1) The 122 schools employed totally 490 full-time professional guidance counselors, of which 415 are counseling psychologists. The service time of full-time professional counselors was 84.53% spending in the administrative services, except the individual counseling. Part-time professional counselors focused on individual counseling, test interpretation, and group/class counseling. (2) The quantity and quality of professional guidance counselors in each school have improved, which has also prompted each school gradually to comply with the law. However, it is not a long-term solution for each school to rely solely on funding from the Ministry of Education. Schools should continue to review and pay attention to the counselor-to-student ratio, and allocate resources to support recruitment of counselors. In addition, the roles and tasks of different counseling professionals, as well as the mode of division of labor and cooperation, still need to be continuously examined by each school. (3) The impact of the increasing number of professional guidance counselors is as follows: more initiative in counseling work, and more pratical in counseling services, cross-unit cooperation, adequate counselors to deal with crisis cases, improving the quantity and quality of counseling work, enriching school resources and professional diversity, and deepening and broadening the counseling work, etc. (4) One of the challenges for professional guidance counselors comes from the expectations of the school’s senior supervisors. The senior officials of the school expected that professional guidance counselors may maintain flexibility in their roles and tasks, and have more interaction and cooperation with personnel from different units in the school system. (5) The impact of low birth rate has led to uncertainty in the source of enrollment. Therefore, schools are relatively conservative in hiring professional guidance counselors. Whether or not the funding subsidy policy continues will affect the willingness of schools to continue the employment policy of professional guidance counselors. Based on the above findings, this study proposed suggestions for counseling practice, policy, and future research. Recommendations for policy and future research: (1) Survey the needs of students and enhance the role and function of professional counselors. (2) The role, tasks, division of labor, and cooperation between different mental health professionals (Clinical Psychologist, Counseling Psychologist, & Social worker) should be continuously assessed in order to improve the effectiveness of professional guidance counselors. (3) Improve the understanding of the senior supervisors in the school about professional guidance counseling. (4) Maintain the stability of funding subsidies and human resources policies. (5) The Ministry of Education should continue to support the professional guidance counseling in universities to meet the needs of students.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202201-202202080018-202202080018-111-146,63,2022,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Relations of Parental Psychological Control with Junior High School Students' Aggression and Victimization: A Multiple-Path analysis,Ying-Fen Chang,"victimization, Aggression, parental psychological control, social anxiety, hostile-biased Attribution","Most studies based on single one aggression or victimization theory analyzed the relations of parental psychological control with children' aggression or victimization, which only could understand the specific effect of the unique factor focused on by single one aggression or victimization theory. Furthermore, most studies explored the relations of parental psychological control with children's aggression or victimization, respectively. Some found that parental psychological control could predict children's aggression; others found that parental psychological control could predict children' victimization; some found that parental psychological control could predict children's aggression mediated by social anxiety; others found that parental psychological control could predict children's victimization mediated by social anxiety, which easily made misunderstanding that the effects of parental psychological control on children's aggression and victimization were the same. Therefore, this study integrated several aggression (social learning theory, strain theory, frustration-anger theory, social information processing theory) and victimization theories to construct a model of parental psychological control, aggression, and victimization in order to simultaneously analyze the relations of parental psychological control with aggression and victimization and to explore the difference between the effects of parental psychological control on children's aggression and those on children's victimization. There were 1,153 junior high school students participated in this study, and structural equation modeling was used. The following results were obtained: (1) the model of parental psychological control, aggression, and victimization fitted the observed data well; (2) parental psychological control positively predicted social anxiety, hostile-biased attribution, and aggression; (3) social anxiety positively predicted hostile-biased attribution and victimization; and (4) hostile-biased attribution positively predicted social anger and aggression; social anger positively predicted aggression. Accordingly, the path analysis of parental psychological control on victimization was that parental psychological predicted children's victimization through their social anxiety. There were three predictive paths of parental psychological control on aggression. The first one (based on social learning theory) was that parental psychological control directly predicted children's aggressing; the second one (based on strain theory, frustration-anger theory, and social information processing theory) was that parental psychological control predicted children's aggression by virtue of their hostile-biased attribution and social anger; and the last one which is also based on strain theory, frustration-anger theory, and social information processing theory was that parental psychological control predicted children's aggression by virtue of their social anxiety, hostile-biased attribution, and social anger. Concerning academic contribution, first, this study broke through past research only focusing on single one theory and adopted multiple perspectives to investigate the relations of parental psychological control with children' aggression and victimization by integrating several aggression (social learning theory, strain theory, frustration-anger theory, social information processing theory) and victimization theories. Thus, this study not only showed that the effects of the distinct factors stressed by different theories, but only found that those factors interacted to influence the relations of parental psychological control with children' aggression and victimization. Second, this study expanded past research exploring the relations of parental psychological control with children's aggression or victimization, respectively by simultaneously investigating the relations of parental psychological control with both aggression and victimization to clarify the difference between the effects of parental psychological control on children's aggression and those on children's victimization. Thus, this study showed that distinct operation mechanisms of parental psychological control towards children's aggression and victimization. Parental psychological control could directly predict children's aggression; parental psychological control could predict children's victimization by means of their social anxiety. This study also found that distinct predictive paths from parental psychological control to children's aggression and victimization. The effects of parental psychological control on children's victimization only mediated by their social anxiety; not only social anxiety but also hostile-biased attribution and social anger are important mediators in the effects of parental psychological control on children's aggression. According to the above-mentioned results, this study provided practical suggestion for parents, teachers, and counselors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202109-202110010012-202110010012-1-34,62,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Psychologists' Experiences on Home-based Mental Health Services for the Bereaved Crime Victims,Ya-Feng Hung,"bereaved crime victims, mental health service delivery, home-based counseling, Association for victims support","The mental health issues caused by violent death of family members have attracted a lot of attention, and the bereaved ones may experience both symptoms of trauma and grief, and high mental health risks, such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and complicated grief would also be derived from these incidences. In Taiwan, The Association for the Protection of Crime Victims (AVS) is the main unit that provides psychological trauma recovery services for the victims. This AVS often adopts home-based mental health service delivery mode. However, the home-based mental health service model is not common to the psychologists who have always accepted the office treatment training model. This research is to explore the psychologists' views on the home-based mental health services regarding the bereaved families of crime victims, as well as the challenges perceived during the services and coping strategies. In this study, a qualitative research method of discovery orientation was used to collect the experiences in home-based mental health service of 12 psychologists (including 4 clinical psychologists, 8 counseling psychologists, a total of 5 males and 7 females) who have more than two years of experience in providing services in a semi-structured interview. The data analysis method adopts analysis strategies such as open coding, axial coding and selective coding based on grounded theory research. The results indicated that these psychologists' views on home-based mental health services can be divided into four aspects: (1) The origin of home counselling and the meaning of continuous services for psychologists. The origin is to increase the volume of service delivery, and the psychologists are willing to continue to serve because of professional recognition and social responsibility; (2) Advantages of home counseling, including empathy and deep understanding, easy to build relationships naturally. It is beneficial to facilitate emotion and awareness; (3) Adjustments to home-based mental health services, including flexibility to meet client needs and background, immediate adjustment and maintain the treatment structure; (4) The effectiveness and reasons of service, which refer to good counseling effectiveness from being able to manage real life issues and the effectiveness is naturally implemented in life; the limited effectiveness of counseling is related to the lack of preparation of the client, the insufficient dominant power of the psychologist, and the interference in the house environment that affects the depth of the session. Psychologists perceive the challenge of home counseling with two themes. First of all, the subversion of the inertia of counseling work, including loss of safety and familiarity, and difficulty in controlling the structure of the interview. Second, the blurring of professional roles and relationship boundaries which includes blurred professional roles and the crossing of professional boundaries. In response to challenges, psychologists have developed multiple strategies to ensure personal safety, the structure of meetings, and balance the emotional bond and boundaries of relationships. Although the origin of home-based mental health services is to increase the rate of service received by bereaved victims, this study believes that the home-based mental health services has the meaning for social justice. The effectiveness of home-based mental health services may be related to the traumatic bereavement process and preparation of the victims. Such service also strengthens the emotional bond between the psychologists and clients. In addition, it also makes psychologists caught in the pull of emotional bond and boundary. Psychologists would consider maintaining the emotional bond between each other while setting boundaries. This has also prompted researchers to reflect on the norms of therapeutic relations and boundaries under Western counseling education.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202109-202110010012-202110010012-35-75,62,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Data were collected and analyzed by description statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, ANOVA, and process model analysis. The results showed that: (1) In terms of ＂self-kindness＂ and ＂mindfulness＂, local students and Malaysian overseas Chinese students obtain a higher average score than Hong Kong and Macau students; In terms of ＂isolation＂ and ＂over-identification＂, local students and Hong Kong and Macau students obtain a higher average score than Malaysian overseas Chinese students. (2) Self-compassion and subjective well-being plays a partially serial mediating role in the prediction from family stress to depression for local students, Malaysian overseas Chinese students, and Hong Kongese and Macanese overseas Chinese students. (3) Self-compassion and subjective well-being plays a partially serial mediating role in the prediction from furture planning stress to depression for local students, Malaysian overseas Chinese students, and Hong Kongese and Macanese overseas Chinese students. (4) Self-compassion and subjective well-being plays a partially serial mediating role in the prediction from economic stress to depression for local students, and Malaysian overseas Chinese students. (5) Self-kindness, self-criticism, isolation, over-identification, and subjective well-being plays a partially serial mediating role in the prediction from economic stress to depression for Hong Kongese and Macanese overseas Chinese students. (6) Self-compassion and subjective well-being plays a partially serial mediating role in the prediction from emotional quarrel stress to depression for local students, Malaysian and Hong Kongese Macanese overseas Chinese students. (7) Self-compassion and subjective well-being plays a partially serial mediating role in the prediction from interpersonal stress to depression for local students, Malaysian and Hong Kongese Macanese overseas Chinese students. The research suggestion can provide attention and guidance on the aspects of ＂study, future employment and further education planning and economic life adaptation＂ of Malaysian overseas Chinese students. In addition, higher education can regularly organize study skills and after-school stress relief courses. To enable Malaysian students who are more active in their academic work to have a way to deal with their higher learning pressure. The research suggests that Hong Kong and Macau students can pay attention to and provide guidance on ＂learning, future employment and further studies planning, language, and interpersonal communication＂. In addition, universities and colleges must implement special remedial teaching for Hong Kong and Macao students who are not able to connect to the language or high school curriculum to resolve differences in language and learning progress. The majority of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Macao use Cantonese and Portuguese as the main language, so it is more necessary to strengthen the language courses. Many Hong Kong and Macao students choose to study in Taiwan because it is difficult to enroll in universities in their places of residence. Therefore, their motivation to study is lower than that of Malaysian overseas students. Therefore, colleges and universities need to hold courses and lectures related to the future goals and planning of the department more often, so that Hong Kong and Macao students have a deeper understanding of their own departments, and increase their sense of belonging, identity and motivation to study. Career development and employment counseling groups/psychological counseling centers or international cooperation offices of colleges and universities need to provide overseas Chinese students with friendly and convenient academic counseling and future planning counseling. And they need to hold regular activities, courses, and lectures to let them understand how the status of overseas Chinese students develops in Taiwan, the future development of the field of the department, whether they can be employed in Taiwan, or whether they can effectively bridge the field after returning to the overseas residence of professionalism. If colleges and universities can provide such assistance, overseas Chinese students can study in Taiwan with greater peace of mind.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202109-202110010012-202110010012-77-116,62,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Process of Ethical Judgment on Managing the Conflict of Internets between the Enterprise and Employees in Workplace Counseling,"Su-Hui Chang, Ya-Yu Cheng, Jin-Fong Chuang, Chih-Hung Wang","ethical conflict, ethical judgment, workplace counseling, Conflicts of interest, EAPs","This research explores the ethical judgment process encountered regarding the conflict of interests between companies and employees in workplace counseling services. We interviewed with an in-depth method and established qualitative data analysis by utilizing the purpose sampling method. The qualification of participants all have counseling psychologist licenses and more than two years of workplace counseling experience. They also had experiences of encountering ethical judgments issues due to conflicts of interest between the company and employees. In this study, we selected five counseling psychologists for personal in-depth interviews. Template analysis was used for data analysis. We found that different types of conflict of interests between companies and employees could involve workplace counseling, and would experience conflict judgment and influenced various stages: Initially at the first stage which is identified as the conflict stage. These psychologists would encounter: (1) The conflict between the company's productivity and the needs of employees' mental health; (2) The conflict between the company's management and the rights of employees; (3) The conflict between the company's labor needs and the needs of employees' career development; (4) Company performance regarding the conflict between management and employees' job security; (5) The conflict between the protection of corporate interests and the protection of employees' rights. The subsequent stage, which is identified as the judgment stage, will consider three aspects. First of all, judging whether the rights and interests of employees have been jeopardized; second of all, judging whether the interests of the enterprise have been compromised. Finally, it is about the judgment regarding relevant labor laws and regulations. At this stage, there are three ways of managing different matters. First, enterprises consider labor costs and refer to external resources, then make good use of informed consent; and finally, is to seek expert consultation and refer to industry practices. At the last stage, which refers to the impact phase, these psychologists would assist and find adaptation methods through the support system via four steps: (1) to establish a relationship and obtain approval from the organization or supervisor; (2) to adjust role functions regarding multi-role burden; (3) to take into accounts the voices or needs of dual customers; and the last, to expand the organization view or system view. Managing the ethical judgment process of the conflict of interest between the enterprise and its employees, making decisions based on the dual-axis concept of enterprise system and employee welfare is necessary. Psychologists must understand the system perspective and change their perspectives from a single situation to dual situations. In summary, the ethical judgment process that encounters the conflict of interest between the company and its employees in corporate consulting indeed may experience a process of conflict, consideration, action, result, influence, and adjustment. This study at the end proposed recommendation as followed: (1) Suggestions to workplace counselors: Facing the context of the dual clients of organization and employees, workplace counselors need more knowledge in addition to the professional education of ＂counselors＂ or theoretical knowledge of psychology, as well as business management human resources, labor laws, and EAPs. And other related professional knowledge. (2) Suggestions for training institutions for counselors: The training institution for counselors should offer courses on workplace counseling and EAPs to enhance learners' understanding of the workplace environment. In the curriculum planning, adding the theme of workplace organizational culture, value system, management system, and workplace counseling ethics can enhance the ability to respond to and judge the conflicts of workplace counseling ethics. A more comprehensive review of the ethical conflicts in workplace counseling presented by different industries and members of different organizations. (3) Suggestions for future research: Future research may consider including male counselors and different industry categories. In addition to counselors, research objects may include workplace employees and their organization's supervisors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202109-202110010012-202110010012-117-151,62,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Influence of Chinese Christian Authority on Individuals in Taiwan,"Zih-Rong Chen, Hung Chiao, Mein-Woei Suen","Chinese Christianity, religious authority, spirituality, submissive, cultural context","One of the common cultural values shared within Chinese communities is to obey the authority. Christian doctrine emphasizes obedience as a response to the Christian practice of faith. Obedience, as an important practice in various forms of human relations, such as between the older-younger siblings, the parent-child relationship, husband and wife, and the employer-employee relationship. The primary object of this study is to understand Chinese Christians' mentality and psychological connotations of the religious authority as well as the concept of obedience in both Chinese cultural and religious context. The study aims to promote the exploration of spiritual experiences in the context of Taiwanese culture in order to understand the psychological mechanisms that arise from the concept obedience in individuals. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling to select those with the most data available. Potential participants who were interested in this study were referred by church members and/or directly invited by the first author. All of them filled out the ＂Francis Christian Attitude Scale＂ and only the ones whose scores reached the targeted level were contacted for a phone screening or a face-to-face interview. Finally, three participants, between the ages of 21 and 28, two have been Christians for more than 10 years and one has been only three years, were recruited for the study and participated in several interview sessions. The study used phenomenology for research paradigm to extract and to restore participants' experiences in religion, as well as to describe their internal explanations of religious authority. The results indicated that psychological mechanisms which promotes personal obedience are composed of (1) the formation of faith in the external environment (e.g., church, religious leaders, and religious texts); (2) how individuals' understanding of faith (understanding of religious norms, shapes of God's imagery, and the process of church interactions) affects the Christians' emotional reactions of obedience, and (3) the positive and negative coping and outcomes. The external environment experienced by the participants includes the church, religious texts, and religious leaders to help shape the individual's understanding of faith. The Christians are able to construct their own understanding of what Christianity looks like as well their knowledge and practice of the divine-human relationship and religious norms. They are also able to form their own personal image of God, and give back to the spiritual situation through positive or negative church interactions. Individuals understand the previous three dimensions via the process of self-awareness, and to choose active obedience, passive obedience, and disobedience, which followed by different emotional outcomes, spiritual adaptation, and results. In summary, three aspects have been concluded. First, God has strong impacts on Chinese Christians' daily life, and the religious regulations transmit through family, church, and Bible. Individuals internalize religious authority into their value systems during the transmission process. Second, obedient to God may help Christians reduce risks, make the safest and proper choices, become ＂the man after God's own heart＂ , as well as gain spiritual growth and blessings. Third, differences between religious authority and Christian values create contradictions and doubts; thus, Christians may feel guilty and regretted when breaking commandments and teachings. Last, doubt and skepticism in faith may also be removed through the verification of daily practice and newly-gained self-awareness, or be modified through communication with religious leaders in the church. Individuals grow in the process of re-examining themselves and faith. Based on the object relationship theory, the results indicated that the relationships with parents and elders in the family in Chinese society extend to the believers' image of God as a way of honoring God. In addition, Christians practice their faith as the pursuit of moral and ethical transcendence. The passages of obedience appear not only to the members of the church as the honor of the other to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities, but also to respond to God as the honor of the other who is willing to be appointed by God. This study at the end concluded with a discussion of counseling ethics in relationship between clients and their therapists in spiritual counseling.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202109-202110010012-202110010012-153-188,62,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
What is Called Progress? A Phenomenological Study on Social Interaction of Adolescents with Mild Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Shao-I Mo, Cheng-Fen Chang","social interaction, qualitative research, pragmatics, phenomenology, Mild autism spectrum disorder","This study aimed at understanding the phenomena of progresses in social interaction among adolescents with mild autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most researches on adolescents with mild ASD adopted the idea of progress that indicated a view of deficiency and took competence as the focus of intervention. While some of them claimed to have positive results in helping the mild ASD subjects gain progress (i.e., being more capable in social interaction), there are no promising changes appearing in long term observation and most of the adolescents with mild ASD have limited capacity in social interaction throughout their lives. To understand this contradiction concerning the phenomena of progress, this study carefully reviewed the definitions of progress employed in these literatures and found that, the progress conceptualized in most of existing studies can be described as a ＂competence-focused＂ one which is obtained from measuring the subjects' capacity in comparison with their own level of social interaction performance before the research manipulation, or in comparison with the normal children participating in the research. Thus, the obtained progress exists only within a narrow condition and could not be replicated outside the research settings. Putting aside the view of deficiency, this study adopted the paradigm of discovery and intended to grasp the phenomena of social interaction of the adolescents with mild ASD as a whole in order to clarify the possible dimensions of its progress. Three mothers of adolescents with mild ASD were interviewed for their long-term observation of their children's social interaction. Using a phenomenological method, interview transcriptions were analyzed and resulted in a description of the general structure of social interaction of adolescents with mild ASD. The general structure revealed from the analysis is composed with five themes. (1) Embodied rule-sticking behaviors, which indicates the rules the subjects with mild ASD stick with have the character of being ontological and never fall into the level of negotiation. (2) Lacking of feedback loops in communicative interaction, which shows that the subjects with mild ASD are not able to comprehend the communicative cues other than overt language and thus no modification would occur even as they offend others. (3) Conversation on specific interests and habits raising the quality of interaction, which highlights the phenomena that the subjects and their conversation partners will ignore the communicative hindrance and advance their interaction while focus on the topic of interest. (4) Other-depending pragmatic impact in communication, which indicate that the pragmatic impact along with the ASD style of communication can be enlarged or eliminated by the conversation partners as they adopt different attitudes. And (5) complying behavior when no conflict with others, which denotes that as the interaction partners deliberately avoid conflict with the subjects with mild ASD, the latter could comply the others' request. According to these findings, even though the characters of ASD style of communication are still salient and prevailing, ＂progresses＂ in interaction can also be obtained due to the topics of interest, the others' attitude toward the pragmatic impact from the talk of the subjects and deliberate avoidance to conflict by the others. It is clear that the progress can be observed not due to the improvement of competence but the others' responses. This understanding solves the contradiction concerning the phenomena of progress appearing in the existing literatures. In addition to answering the research questions, our findings also provide a conceptual reflection to the studies on adolescents with mild ASD and a guidance for practitioners to design proper plans for training the adolescents. Last but not least, stemming from this research is also an advocacy to the public: The interaction with people with mild ASD is a process for mutual understanding rather than proving their being deficient.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202105-202105310002-202105310002-21-56,61,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Process Study of Experiential Approach Warm-up-Using Body Warm-up Activities in Psychodrama,"Shu-Yu You, Yi-Ping Lin","Body warm-up activities, psychodrama, experiential approach warm up, hermeneutic phenomenology","This study aimed at revealing the experiential structure of participants in experiential approach warm-up. Experiential approach warm-up is based on phenomenology, experiential therapy, and the concept of authentic movement. The researchers reviewed the warm-up theory of psychodrama, the body experience in phenomenology, experiential approach, and the concept of authentic movement. In the experiential approach warm-up, there were some body warm-up activities, including body movement, meditation, role play, concretization. In the study, the researcher used the paradigm of hermeneutic phenomenology. The five selected participants were assessed by two psychodrama expert as ＂spontaneous participants＂ according to the five dimensions of the spontaneity (Lai, 2017). The five participants were all women between 22 and 50 years old, and their Psychodrama training hours ranged from 70 to 280 hours. After the group, the researcher asked the five participants to write down their experience after participating in body warm-up activities. Phenomenological analysis (Lee & Lai, 2009) was applied to the descriptions of experience obtained from five participants after they attended experiential approach warm-up. The experiential structure of participants in experiential approach warm-up were obtained. Two main findings were obtained. (1) The experiential structure of warm-up in psychodrama consisted of two dimensions of behaviors. One was the vertical dimension, indicating the words-bodily feelings connection: participants were warmed up through bodily activities and participants experienced themselves. The other was the horizontal dimension, indicating the interpersonal verbal and nonverbal communication Repetitive in group. Participants' bodily feelings were aroused and participants experienced themselves. (2) The experiential structure of warm-up included 4 structures: (a) When group members just came into the group, group members felt confused, were distant from the group and were struggling to be the Protagonist. (b) Through the mutual sharing, support and interaction between group members, group members felt supported and relaxed, and they could participate in the group psychologically. (c) When members saw or heard others' sharing, member experienced themselves, understood themselves and others, and thought of some life events. There are two subthemes in the structure. One is ＂members saw or heard other's sharing-body feelings-understood themselves and others＂, the other is ＂members shared their experience or heard others' sharings-body feelings-think of life events-awareness＂. (d) members used body warm-up activities (body movement, meditation, role play, concretization) to do warm-up, members can experience themselves, think of life events and experience themselves. There are three subthemes in the structure. The first is ＂body movement-the touch of the body-body feelings-experience themselves＂. The second is ＂body warm-up activities (body movement, meditation, role play)-body feelings-think of life events-awareness＂. The third is ＂body warm-up activities (body movement, meditation, concretization)-body feelings-awareness＂. In the study, the researcher discussed the relationship between body warm-up experience and spontaneity and the mechanism of experiential approach warm-up. The mechanism of experiential warm-up is : (1) the verbal and nonverbal behavior between members evoke the body experience of members and facilitate spontaneity. (2) body warm-up activities help members being here-and-now and prepare for being the protagonist. Through this study, various significant features regarding experiential approach warm-up were clarified. The study helps to understand the experience of participating in body warm-up activities. However, the findings may not apply to other types of warm-up; not can the study explain the experience of the participants who are in low spontaneity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202105-202105310002-202105310002-57-88,61,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Theoretical and Practical Implications of Narrative Healing of Psychological Trauma,Wen-Sheng Wang,"narrative healing, narrative, Ricoeur, Arendt, psychological trauma","This article considers the problem of healing of psychological trauma from the narrative perspective. Narrative is a way to travel through the trauma of concealing memory, and even pain. We should not stick on the technical side, but rather look into the narrative theory. It includes the temporal structure of narrative formation (narrative time), and the meaning that a narrative composition of a series of events is based on (narrative meaning). The former involves how to form the time of narrative, and the latter involves the reason why narrative can heal pain. These are expounded in Ricoeur's ＂Time and Narrative,＂ and refer to Augustine, Aristotle, Heidegger, and Arendt. The narrative time is a synthesis of subjective and objective time, beyond the subjective time on the one hand, represented by Augustine, and Heidegger's authentic time, and the objective time on the other, represented by Aristotle and Heidegger's vulgar time, and on the basis of Heidegger's concept of ＂within-timeness.＂ Arendt's commitment of human immortality is also related to that. The meaning of narration can be recurred to Aristotelian ＂catharsis,＂ and Freudian ＂mourning＂. Respect or love for forgiveness is not a condition of narrative, but they involve the issue of narrative integration, and can back up the narrative meaning to explain the healing of trauma. Theory is examined by clinical experience. In the practical part, I first clarify the two ways Der-Heuy Yee emphasizes on narrative based on the hermeneutic phenomenological psychology: narrative presupposes distanciation of a client from his or her involvement in a trauma situation, and narrative can constitute cultural psychology. This can be verified by the practical research conducted by him and An-Bang Yu, and can be supplemented by the narrative methods proposed by Michael White and David Epston who recently have been introduced into Taiwan. Distanciation is a way for narrative to travel through trauma concealing painful memories. This is also clear from the discussion of a research report by Yaw-Sheng Lin who carried out narrative research on the case of the September 21 earthquake and demonstrated how the narrative could begin from the traumatic situation. In addition, according to this research, the importance of narrative exchange and integration can be verified. The meaning of narration can be linked to Aristotle's Poetics, but the research shows the particularity of Chinese culture, which also proves the way that narrative constitutes cultural psychology emphasized by Der- Heuy Yee. To put it concretely, narration is after all a way for people to devote themselves to self-satisfaction, but as far as narration is concerned, because the mother in this case lives in a network of relationships with her eldest son to whom her psychological trauma is imputed. It is necessary for her to establish a narrative relationship with him to exchange memories to achieve narrative effect. In this case, the eldest son himself, and his wife, should also tell the story through interviews, and the exchange of memories between them and the mother should be the researcher's consulting strategy. Yaw-Sheng Lin has tried to enable this mother to gradually get along with his eldest son and daughter-in-law. However, the establishment of this relationship between mother and son and daughter-in-law has not been realized in the actual process of consultation. Nevertheless, this mother can finally get some healing for her soul, and her life is peaceful because of her psychological shift to take care of her grandchildren. The reason is that Chinese people often suffer due to the break in the relationship between relatives and friends, and their suffering is often overcome by a new connection with relatives and friends. This case in which the psychological shift of a client to the care of grandchildren and so a connection with them leads to a peaceful life shows an example. It is manifested that the peaceful result of mother' soul is not affected by a new narrative relationship; however, this result is acquired though a narrative consulting, which can inspire us to think about how narrative strategy should take cultural background into consideration. This is a viewpoint of that narrative can constitute cultural psychology. One central theme of this article is: Narrative therapy originates from suffer and aims to release a person from suffer; suffer is the borderline for a person to transcend his/her limitation; narrative is a kind of way to cross the borderline. Der-Heuy Yee aimed to develop the significance of the borderline of suffering in terms of his later foundation of ＂humanistic clinical practice.＂",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202105-202105310002-202105310002-89-117,61,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Enquiry of ＂Lived Experience＂ and ＂Being＂ in Narrative Study: Taking Path through Hermeneutic Phenomenology and Emotional Geography,"Shyh-Heng Wong, Rong-Bang Peng","narrative enquiry, hermeneutic phenomenology, existential philosophy, emotional geography","The purpose of this study is to enquire ＂lived experience＂ and ＂being＂ from the nature of time and space. The authors argued that meaning construction needs to take terms methodologically by hermeneutic phenomenology and emotional geography. Four discussion points are showed as follows and used to articulate the utility of narrative analysis. Firstly, this study defines the enquiry itself as enquiring ＂being＂ in its subjectivity or intersubjectivity. Through reviewing the ＂narrative turn＂ in the history of qualitative research, narrative is stated as the representation of one's self and therefore studying one's life story is to explore the meaning construction of lived experience, which is through saying and said, and has its subject from and object for. Ontologically, it is argued that meaning in narrative has its own time and space and therefore researchers need to find the route of how meaning could be developing. The second part of this study is to further debate the nature of ＂lived experience＂ and ＂being＂ as topographical and geographical. Meaning develops with its directions between self and other; therefore, a researcher's ambition to ＂reflect＂ outside world or ＂reflexively＂ clarifies inner world of oneself and decides the attitude of studying meaning construction of lived experience. This part defines and reviews the ontological concern of ＂being＂ and its relation of space and time. From current finding of emotional geography in Europe, narrative could therefore be widen its epistemological and methodological perspective for exploring ＂being＂ and ＂lived experience＂. In the third part of this study, according to our ontological arguments epistemological perspectives have been elaborated for understanding meaning construction of ＂being＂ and ＂lived experience＂. The dimensions of time and space are particularly relevant here. Through Heidegger's contribution of Dasein analysis and dwelling concepts, we defined narrative has its time linear structure in which presence is in-between the past and future, and has its space structure of being-in-a-space, from geographer Malpas's contribution. We linked Winnicott's concept of ＂transitional space＂ and discussed the ＂being＂ as the ethics between self, other, and transitional space, and further discussed the indigenous studies conducted in Taiwan about the structural concern as well as the topographical nature of perception. The final part of the arguments focuses two methodological concerns: route and structure. The former lead to the discussion of geographical approach towards qualitative data. Here the illustration of mental landscape is offered and is argued as an analytic method. Humanistic geographical approach developed in recent decades focused on reflexive description of self-other relationship and the mental/emotional landscape, so that lived experience and being could be illustrated by where and how the meaning is constructed. Therefore the route and structure of meaning construction can then be represented. The second methodological concern take narratives to the hermeneutics and phenomenology of meaning construction, in which Husserl used ＂epoche＂ as the method of temporally disregarding its causality but the ＂things itself＂. This method could help a researcher systematically investigate both temporal and topographical nature of lived experience. From Wei-Lun Lee's six-step correction from Giorgi's five steps of analysis, the way in which ＂being＂ can be opened into the description of phenomenon. Also, Lee's methodological investigation to human perception was followed for exploring the structure of lived experience itself. This study particularly focuses on the temporal structure of narratives, and taking the final methodological path through the circle of hermeneutics, which regards narrative as having its circle of interpretation as the process of meaning construction. A method named Critical Narrative Analysis (CNA) is discoursed here. Six steps of data analysis for qualitative data is introduced for concluding the concern for enquiring meaning structure within narratives, especially when data is with historical and temporal characteristics. By above arguments, the understanding of narratives according its ontology, epistemology and methodology is carefully linked with the use of narrative analysis in counseling and psychotherapeutic practice. And methodological concerns of narrative are concluded for answering how and why taking path through hermeneutic phenomenology and emotional geography is important in narrative enquiries.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202105-202105310002-202105310002-119-151,61,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
A Study on the Attribution of Success or Failure toward Major Life Events among College Students in Taiwan,"Ming-Chang Tsai, Su-Ciou Ceng","scale, life education, undergraduate, Attribution of success or failure, school counseling","'Attribution of success or failure' refers to the personal understanding of causes of success or failure. For life education and school counseling, attribution of success or failure has important implications. Across the lifespan, an individual often experiences many successes and failures. When individual encountering the similar situations, behavioral tendency will depend on his attributional interpretation of prior success or failure experience. Attribution of success or failure is the phenomenal causality rather than the true cause. But the influence of the phenomenal causality is more important than the real cause. Therefore, if students can be guided to appropriate attribution of their own success or failure, it can help them form a positive outlook on life, which could be helpful in meaning of life education and counseling. Weiner's attribution theory of success or failure and research in this area have provided rich results since 1970's. However, the indigenous concepts of fate have not been incorporated in this theory context. It would be not enough to explain the experience of success or failure toward major life events. There are limited empirical studies that combine the theory of success and failure attribution with the traditional concept of destiny. If we can combine the two, we should have a more complete understanding of the psychological status of students, which will be more conducive to education and counseling. Based on this, the purposes of this study were to (a) develop a research scale for the attribution of success or failure of college students in Taiwan; and (b) understand the current situation of college students' attribution of the success or failure toward major life events. Based on the findings, the researcher discusses the implications of this study on school education and counseling. The present study included college students as participants. Through the discussion of the theory of attribution and the perspective of traditional destiny, the present study summarizes the basic structure of attribution toward major life events so as to develop an instrument of attribution of success or failure for Taiwanese college students. A total of 1222 undergraduates were recruited using stratified multistage sampling to investigate the attribution of success or failure. The results of the study show that the study summarizes the theory of attribution and the perspective of traditional destiny, and increases the orientation of ＂understandability＂ to develop the ＂Scale of Attribution of Success and Failure Toward Major Life Events of College Student ＂. The scale includes six subscales. Each subscale contains two dimensions of prosperity and adversity which has good reliability and validity. The attribution of the success or failure of undergraduates toward major life events are based primarily on the attribution of effort and ability factors. There is a significant interaction between the attribution of success or failure toward major life events and dimensions of prosperity and adversity, and the interaction between the six attribution factors and five life events is also significant. There is a significant relationship between religious factors and the attribution of success or failure of college students. Finally, the researcher discusses the implications of this study on school education and counseling: (1) In the process of education and counseling, it is the primary task to promote students' understanding of themselves in order to set reasonable goals for all major events in life; (2) To guide students to think about their own way of life when faced with the dilemma of doing their best but still failing; (3) In order to prevent students from forming a fatalistic outlook on life, students should be trained to do their best.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202101-202101290007-202101290007-1-36,60,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Relationship Satisfaction as a Mediator of Violent Behaviors and Relationship Commitment of Intimate Partners in Marriageable Ages,"Ying-Yu Su, Hui-Chuang Chu","intimate partner violence, relationship satisfaction, relationship commitment, Intimate partner in marriageable age","This study was designed to explore the violent behavior between intimate partners in age for marriage and understood whether the romantic relationship satisfaction functioned as a mediator which was affected by the intimate partner violent behavior and the commitment of a romantic relationship between intimate partners. The definition of intimate violence in the study was meant that unmarried and married men and women in their intimate relationships are subjected to intimate partner violence or violence against intimate partners, and that violent patterns include ＂serious violence＂, ＂minor violence＂, ＂sexual and intimate violence＂ and ＂verbal violence＂. Romantic relationship satisfaction of this study was defined as the satisfaction of an individual with the intimate relationship in which he or she was located. And romantic relationship satisfaction, it should be from the subjective point of view of the individual to understand the cognition, behavior and feeling of the individual in the relationship. Therefore, the relationship commitment in this study is defined as an individual's willingness to love the person and to maintain a long-term relationship with his or her partner in an intimate relationship. This study recruited 504 intimate partners in marriageable age as research subjects. Among them were 385 (76.4%) females w and 119(23.6%) males. The average age of the participants was 32.9 years with a standard deviation of 3.20 years, the average romantic relationship duration was 37.22 months, the median duration of the relationship was 22.00 months. They were asked to fill a set of questionnaires, including Intimate Partner Violent Behaviors Scale, Relationship Satisfaction Scale, and Relationship Commitment Scale. We analyzed the data by using descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, and stepwise multiple regression. The results were as follows: First, about 56.5% of the participants experienced intimate partner violent behaviors. About 37.3% of the participants were both victims and perpetrators in violent behaviors. Second, the data showed that there was a positive correlation between relationship satisfaction and relationship commitment (r = .624). Third, there was a negative correlation between intimate partner violent behaviors and relationship satisfaction (r = -.24) and between intimate partner violent behaviors and relationship commitment (r = -.29). At last, the two variants of ＂oral violence＂ and ＂sexual and intimate violence＂ jointly explained 8.5% of the variance in relationship commitments, supporting the negative relationship between ＂oral violence＂, ＂sexual and intimate violence＂ and the commitment of relationship. In conclusion, relationship satisfaction had a function as a partial mediator in intimate partner violent behaviors and relationship commitment (β = -.163 vs β = -.109.) It meant that intimate intimacy violence negatively affected relationship satisfaction, which in turn partially affects relationship commitment, reducing the individual's willingness to maintain long-term relationships. There are some recommendations for future research. First, long-term longitudinal and qualitative research should be used to understand the changes in mental process and personal experience. Second, the social expectation variable can be used to value the accuracy of research subjects' answer. Lastly, it is important to find out the cause of violent behaviors and the reason for the individual to engage in violent behavior. In clinical work, practitioners could develop and practice more flexible and appropriate interaction and behavior, offer intervention earlier to reduce violence in romantic relationships, and help individuals in romantic relationship develop effective communication skills.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202101-202101290007-202101290007-37-72,60,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The tree model is referred to as the Friendly and Open for Sexual orientation to the Tree Ecosystem Raise (FOSTER) competency model. The FOSTER model consisted of five aspects. These five aspects are the root, the trunk, the branches, the leaves and the nutrients. Each of these five aspects includes three levels: individual services, system services, and public advocacy. The first aspect is the root, symbolizing the roots and core of the tree, which reflects counselor's attitude. At individual service level, it is recommended that counselors should affirm and identify the sexual orientation of clients and be aware of their own values. At system service level, it is recommended that counselors should have sincere and consistent attitude, as well as the motivation and energy to expand the field of service. At public advocacy level, it is recommended that counselors should be aware of their own social responsibility and agree with the value of speaking out for human rights and equality. The second aspect is the trunk, which symbolizes the support and communication of the trees and reflects counselor's knowledge of viewpoints of sexual orientation and gender discourse ability. At individual service level, it is recommended that counselors should embrace the concept and perspectives of diverse sexual orientation and engage in gender discourse. At system service level, it is recommended that counselors should know the backgrounds of clients and counselors have the ability to assess the systematic impact on clients. At public advocacy level, it is recommended that counselors should be familiar with gender equality laws and the relevant discourse of heterosexual hegemony. The third aspect is the branches, which symbolize the outreach and extension of the trees and reflects counselor's skills. At individual service level, it is recommended that counselors are required to assist the clients in exploring their own subjective identity and promote the values that all sexual orientations are equal in the counseling process. At system service level, it is recommended that counselors should have the ability to create a dialogue space with the client, and counselors must have the ability to use resources and connect resources for clients. The fourth aspect is the leaves, which symbolize the bloom and dense of the trees and reflect counselor's actions. At public advocacy level, it is recommended that counselors should participate in LGBT-related activities, and counselors should have the agency to promote government system and policy changes and make this change beneficial to the situation of LGBT. Furthermore, if the counselors identify themselves as LGBT, they can come out to clients and become the clients' role model in their future life. The fifth aspect is the source of nutrients provided to trees, which symbolize supervision and training and reflects counselor's resources. The nourishment source of nutrients in the FOSTER model includes courses, training, supervision and participation in LGBT-related organizations. The nourishment methods of nutrients in the FOSTER model include self-awareness of counselors and witnessing the life experience of LGBT students or friends. Finally, implications for research and counselor training are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202101-202101290007-202101290007-73-108,60,2021,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"Being a Caregiver for Aging Parents: Adult Children's Filial Belief, Capacity of Integrating Intergenerational Cross-time-and-space Experience, and Their Role Identification of Caregiver","Chih-Wen Wu, Kuang-Hui Yeh","Authoritarian filial piety, capacity of integrating intergenerational cross-time-and-space experiencer, role identification of intergenerational caregiver, reciprocal filial piety","Intergenerational relationships play a central role in shaping elderly well-being, especially for Chinese family, in which filial piety is a primary virtue to urge adult children to fulfill their role obligation as a caregiver of their aging parents. This study adopts the dual filial piety model and investigates the different impacts of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety on adult children's role identification of intergenerational caregiver (RIIC). It is assumed that reciprocal filial piety (RFP) has a more positive influence than authoritarian filial piety (AFP) because the former originates from authentic emotional bonding and facilitates stronger motivation to care about their parents, while the latter is affected by the internalization of Chinese social norms that emphasize children's obedience and submission to their parents. This study further examines the possible mediator, namely Integrating Cross-time-and-space Experience (ICTSE), of the abovementioned relationship between filial piety and RIIC. ICTSE represents a capacity of perspective taking and open thinking which make adult children be able to better review, integrate, and refine their early parent-children interactive experiences by multiple frames about different situations and different roles' perspectives. ICTSE facilitates adult children's self-acceptance in their intergenerational relationships, including their role reversal and identification as a caregiver. This study recruited 724 participants who were above 35 years old. These participants completed the father or/and mother version questionnaire if their father or/and mother was alive and above 60 years old. A total of 488 data were valid for investigating the relationship with father (324 of them were from female participants; average age: 43.03 years old, SD = 6.48 years; average age of their father: 73.15 years old, SD = 8.36 years). In addition, a total of 518 data were valid for investigating the relationship with mother (332 of them were from female participants; average age: 45.76 years old, SD = 7.95 years; average age of their father: 72.25 years old, SD = 8.99 years). This study used structure equation modeling to analyze two hypothetical models. The first model investigated the effect of RFP and AFP on RIIC and showed acceptable model fit for both father- and mother-child relationships. The positive effect of RFP was significant on RIIC for both father-child and mother-child dyads, while that of AFP was significant for only father-child dyad. It also indicated the effect of RFP was more superior to that of AFP for both father and mother targets. The second model further tested the mediating effect of ICSTE and also found acceptable model fit for both father-child and mother-child dyads. The positive effect of RFP was significant on ICSTE for both father-child and mother-child dyads, while that of AFP was significant for only father-child dyad. The effect of RFP was more superior to AFP for both father-child and mother-child dyads. ICTSE had a positively significant effect on RIIC for both father-child and mother-child dyads. The mediating effect of ICTSE in the path from RFP to RIIC was significant for both father-child and mother-child dyads, whereas that in the path from AFP to RIIC was significant for only father-child dyad. This study highlights that filial piety in Chinese society could promote family to bring its functions of supporting and caring for aging parents into fully play. The findings might be important in providing professional consultants and family life educators a better understanding of how filial belief urges Chinese adult to identify their role of intergenerational caregiver and care about their elderly parents' well-being more sincerely.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202009-202009230008-202009230008-1-33,59,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Filial Changes in the Process of Repairing Conflict Relationship after the Gay Men Came Out to His Father,"Ya-feng Hung, Kai-lun Wang","gay, filial piety, come out, father-son relationship, Chinese-culture","In the Chinese patriarchy and the Chinese society that values filial piety, gay men are often regarded as defective gender other people, and they have to bear the crime of ＂unfilial son.＂ When gay men came out to their fathers, how to repair their relationship with their fathers, and filial changes in the restoration process are the two questions to be explored in this study. This study is based on the narrative research and interviews with 3 adult males who have had a rupture relationship with their fathers after coming out and have been successfully repaired. The data analysis method is Gee's discourse analysis, which is used to achieve the social context hidden in the discourse. Finally, integrating the following results by cross-case analysis. The study found that the repair process of father-son relationship can be divided into five periods, which correspond to different filial pieties. (1) In Sudden-Drop period, the son ＂told the truth and hoped the father understood＂ and ＂obeyed discipline to avoid physical conflicts.＂ (2) In Low-Valley period, the son could ＂increase physical or psychological distance to maintain harmony＂ and ＂adjust their appearance or life to please his father.＂ (3) In Wave period, filial piety temporarily disappeared. (4) During the Recovery period, the son ＂increased for no children with other achievements＂ and ＂fed back and accompanied his father.＂ (5) In Step-over period, the son had adopted ＂the way of companionship and compassion to his father＂, and ＂actively revealed his love relationship to communicate＂, and ＂restrained his gay status to reduce father's pressure.＂ The process of repairing the relationship echoes the process of father ’s loss of his son, and this phenomenon is related to the high gay identity, the presence of social support systems, and the involuntary coming out of this research participants. The key events in the restoration process include leaving home and economic autonomy, the intervention of the role of the mother and the presence of survival threats. This study also found that the integration of positive and negative filial dimensions can be close to understanding the filial practice of gay sons. Positive filial dimension refer to those that have made a difference, such as better achievements or traditionally emphasized lineage succession. Negative filial dimension is more implicit, such as obedience to authority discipline, control information to maintain harmony that seem to have no special actions. When the gay son came out to his father, he continued to face the dilemma of conflicting the two identities or roles of the son and the gay. From the perspective of role conflicts, individuals need to try a variety of different strategies to integrate role identity, and to respond to role conflicts through the performance of cognitive acrobatics during the role identity transition. In this study, we can find that in the relationship between father and son, the two roles of son and gay grow and change with the restoration process. In addition, in Chinese culture, filial practice is almost the same as filial piety. Gay son came out to face a dilemma of filial piety. Therefore, the filial changes in the relationship restoration process is also the negotiation and transformation of filial piety belief. As for the degree of relationship repair and whether it is ＂successful＂ coming out depends on the interaction and joint efforts of father and son in the relationship. Finally, the limitations of this study were explained. The three gay men in this study were involuntary to come out to their fathers, and the relationship repair process lasted for 3-8 years. Therefore, the results of this study may be restricted to gay men who are psychologically prepared and voluntarily come out to their fathers. In addition, in this study, the focus of the research was limited to the son's filial changes, and only the gay son was the research participant. Therefore, the appearance of depicting and explaining the relationship repair may not be comprehensive. Based on the research results, relevant suggestions for future research and helpers were also put forward.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202009-202009230008-202009230008-35-67,59,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Effectiveness of Single Clay Therapy on Adolescence with Negative Emotions,"Hui-Chuang Chu, Ming-Jung Hu","clay therapy, Adolescence, negative emotion","Clay was with the characteristic of moldability. In dealing with negative emotions such as loss, anger, counselor worked through the characteristics of clay to allow client to find internal resourcing and the feeling of empowerment. Negative emotions were expressed and transformed by the clay, and originally unspeakable emotions can be visualized. And those parts of the original unspeakable can be visualized. For adolescents that were not good at verbal expression, clay has good facilitating effect (Sherwood, 2004). In this study, we use the human face doll deflating ball as warm-up materials and the ultra-light clay as the intervention materials, so that young people through the creative process to achieve the effectiveness of release stress. Data were collected by semi-structure interview and analyzed by thematic analysis. There were five adolescents with negative emotions were interviewed. The interview outline topics included feelings and thoughts about clay creation, impacts for negative emotions, and helpfulness for emotions. The results showed that (1) It was very helpful for adolescents to use clay plasticity to release stress and transform their emotions from negative to positive. Through different creative and contacting movements with clay, emotional catharsis could be achieved, along with reconnection to positive personal life experiences. (2) Clay, with its characteristics of empowerment and reframing, could stimulate internal needs, self-dialogue, and integration of experiences such as important events in early life, to reconnect to emotions from the past and imagine life experiences in a bright and colorful way. The creative process generates self-dialogue and expresses internal needs, for example: ＂cases emerged from a state of silence,＂ ＂the comforting effect of human venting balls,＂ ＂self-homogeneity through the plasticity of the medium,＂ ＂the finished product helps rethink the dilemma of life.” The semi-fluid material could enable the re-experiencing and reorganization of the inner emotions; its connotations include ＂re-framing the meaning of being rejected by peers,＂ ＂reconstruction of self-confidence,＂ ＂enhancement of self-awareness ability,＂ and ＂Reframing emotional expression.＂. (c) Through the unique characteristics of clay, they could link their inner and outer worlds, time context, and the meaning of their actions, resulting in activating their own inner healing power. Further, according to the study, clay could be used as a medium in counseling situations; however, the choice of clay needs consideration. The sensory feeling of the medium is beneficial for promoting the ＂re-recovery of the human-face doll discharge balloon,＂ which can be reshaped through the sensory feelings of ＂beating,＂ ＂slapping,＂ ＂pulling,＂ ＂pressing,＂ and ＂vision＂ and ＂smell,＂ so that the sensation can be re-experience, and thus can catalyze and accelerate the communication of emotions. Concretizing inner feelings represents a ＂re-reminder of the positive attitude of a particular work to the right full,＂ ＂a symbol of the power of self-healing within an individual,＂ ＂a magical self-suggestion and metaphor,＂ and ＂a buffer bridge to form a link between the parties and emotions.＂ It could also be used as intervention to overcome the negative emotions of adolescents through different art media, to understand the differences, and to apply clay to different groups to study its effectiveness. Based on the results of this study, we provide suggestions for related studies and practical activities of expressive art therapy in the future. For example, use of clay in psychotherapy and counseling processes could enhance personal self-awareness; and to explore the effectiveness of different clay such as oil modeling clay, resin clay, pottery clay and light air dry clay may be applied in art therapy research and to apply in different groups. The limitation of the research was that intervention frequency and the small number of participants resulted in certain effectiveness which was discussed, but should be investigated further in different fields.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202009-202009230008-202009230008-69-102,59,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Exploration of Group Therapeutic Factors in the Empowerment-based Horticultural Group Therapy on the Elderly,Jiun-De Lin,"Elderly counseling, therapeutic factors, empowerment, horticultural therapy, horticultural group therapy","There are more positive effects of the horticultural therapy group on the elderly. To understand the group therapeutic factors is to contribute to decide and modify group strategies and concepts, and promote abilities of group practices. The purpose of this study was to explore the therapeutic factors of empowerment-based horticultural therapy group on the elderly. The horticultural therapy group was designed by the concepts of the empowerment in combination with horticultural activities. There were eight sessions in this group program, including understanding plants, planting plants, gardening and horticultural activities. The group was led by a horticultural therapist and a certified counselor. There're 10 over the age of 65 older people who lived in urban areas invited to participate this group. The research methods were used quantitative and qualitative mixed design. The data collection was conducted using quantitative questionnaires and qualitative interviews. ＂Group therapeutic factor inventory＂ were conducted after second, fifth, and last session of this group, and semi-structed in-depth interviews were conducted after the end of the group to understand the therapeutic factors for elderly people participated in this group. The statistical results of questionnaire surveys were found that was a high frequency of ＂positive feeling for group＂, ＂action elicitation＂ and ＂cognitive acquisition＂ in the early stage, ＂positive feeling for group＂ and ＂action elicitation＂ in the medium-term stage, while ＂positive feeling for group＂, ＂action elicitation＂ and ＂altruism＂ in the latter stage of the group. Overall, the highest frequency of ＂positive feeling for group＂ occurred. In order to understand the frequency differences of group therapeutic factors between stages, the Nonparametric statistics method were utilized. The significant differences between the stages were found. There were early and medium-term stage, medium-term and the latter stage of the group, but no difference between early and the latter stage of the group. It had been observed that each frequency of the eight group therapeutic factors has significantly promoted in the latter stage of this group. The results of the interview data analysis were that six beneficial factors such as ＂sharing works, accomplishments, horticultural skills learning, expectations, positive emotions, and health concerns＂ have positive contributions to the elderly. ＂Sharing works＂ were referred to the psychological sharing derived from the completion of horticultural products, that is, the horticultural therapy process allowed the elderly to have the opportunity to share the works completed in the process, and could benefit positively through sharing. ＂Accomplishments＂ were referred to the sense of accomplishment of participating in the horticultural activities. The elderly people felt the gains and achievements through the participation process of this group. ＂Horticultural skills learning＂ were referred to the learning of gardening related skills, that is, the elderly experienced the cooperation, exchange and learning of related skills through the participation of the group. ＂Expectations＂ were referred to expect to participate this horticultural therapy activities, that is, the elderly expressed their expectations and hope for the continuation and participation of future groups in the process of participating in horticultural therapy group. ＂Positive emotions＂ meant the process of horticultural activities brings positive emotions and relief effects, that is, the elderly generally experienced positive relief effects through the participation of horticultural activities, and also have a positive effect on the catharsis of emotions. ＂Health concerns＂ meant that the elderly participants discussed health issues between and after this group sessions, that is, who were involved in this horticultural therapy group to, and experienced the importance of physical health issues through the group process. Overall, there were positive benefits for the elderly participated in the empowerment-oriented horticultural therapy group. Understanding the connotation of group therapeutic factors under the context of horticultural therapy has reference value for the construction and implementation of horticultural therapy for the elderly. According to the research results, it was suggested that a therapeutic factor scale with horticultural therapy characteristics can be developed in the future, and relevant recommendations were provided for follow-up studies and practices.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202009-202009230008-202009230008-103-136,59,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Research of the Original Theory of Chinese Zen Buddhism and its Applications to Education and Guidance: Taking the Theory of Zen Master Hui-Neng and its Verification for the Example,Ming-Wen Wang,"Hui-Neng Zen, self-nature, mental health, Adaptively consciousness processing, self-schema","This study aims to explore the theory of Zen Master Hui-Neng using quantitative method to verify the theoretical characteristics, Master Hui-Neng is well known as the first Chinese Zen Master, who interpreted Buddhism practice with the viewpoint of Chinese culture into the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch Hui-Neng. This paper aims to interpret the viewpoint of Platform Sutra by content analysis method, and verify how it describes mental health state of people by empirical research as well. In brief, the theory of Hui-Neng states that people are born with self-nature in commonality. Individuals who identify the self-nature and in the ＂adaptively＂ consciousness processing can reach the optimal mental health and state of wisdom. On the contrary, emotional disturbances may be generated for those who do not. The two primary purposes of this study are (1) to investigate the difference of self-schema character and fitness in relate to the theory of Zen Master Hui-Neng in different mental health state, (2) to examine the change of characteristics of self-schema and fitness regarding the theory of Zen Master Hui-Neng after the intensive Zen meditation training in a short term. 54 high school students, who were divided into three different groups based on their mental state. Perception Habit Scale＂ (PHS) was provided to analyze the results by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The object-relationship characteristics of self-schema were then decoded and the variables were analyzed by independent chi-square (χ^2) test. The PHS was developed with the viewpoint of ＂adaptively＂ consciousness processing, includes six following indexes: pure-perception, absorption, here and now, awareness, neutrality as mirror, self-adjusting. Another scaling was the characteristics of object-relationships with identification of the self-nature; include six levels of object relations of conflict, denying, self-center, adaptability, concordance, and self-transcendence. The results indicated that (1) The PHSs and distribution of the levels of object-relationships for the subjects of the three groups were significant. The healthier one's mental state is, higher level of object-relationships would be. (2) The main differences of the three groups indicated that there are characteristics of the self-schema and degrees of fitness for the Hui-Neng Zen between different degrees of mental health. To achieve the second purpose, study two employed a pre-post experiment design of unequal groups. Recruiting from senior high schools, there were 8 participants in the experiment group (which attended the Zen meditation training) and 14 participants were in the control group The two variables regarding the characteristics of self-schema are levels of object-relationships which were analyzed by dependent chi-square (χ^2) test, and ＂Perception habit scale＂ (PHS) which were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results indicated that the differences between pretest and posttest are significant for the experiment group, while the control group is not. That is, for the experiment group after Zen meditation training the score of PHSs, distribution of characteristics of higher level object relationships. To conclude, through the intensive Zen meditation in a short term, both the characteristics of the self-schema and degrees of fitness for the Hui-Neng Zen theory improved. The results of this research supported that the mind (nature) viewpoint of the self-identity system of the Hui-Neng Zen is suitable for the realization of self-schema and state of mental health. Zen meditation may effectively adjust individuals' self-schema characteristics to a better one. Based on the theory of Hui-Neng and findings of this study, the researcher developed a model of the process of self-nature actualization and the application both on counseling and special education. Future application and further studies are highly encouraged in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202005-202006010003-202006010003-1-46,58,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Mandala Model of the Self: Kungfuism to Solve Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem,Fu Chen,"kungfuism, Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem, mandala model of the Self, Four dimensions, life world","In this paper, the author starts from the Mandala Model of the Self (MMS) to illustrate that the MMS developed by Hwang Kwang-Kuo just describe how one changes from a biological ＂individual＂ into a social ＂person＂ to make him or her to become a relational self instead of an individual self. However, the MMS lacks the concept of the self but only contains the ego. The MMS fails to rotate the Mandala leading to incapably develop the self, leaving no room for a person become the sanctification defined by the Confucianism. In addition to clarifying the original meaning of mandala, the author also points out that we need to explore all Confucian wisdom we lying in the four dimensions that we confront together: virtue, knowledge, practice, and desire. Virtue refers to the spiritual self-restraint. Knowledge means the understanding about the world. Practice is the existing actions. Desire is to satisfy one's needs; There are two axes. The first virtue axe includes virtue and desire. The first knowledge axe includes knowledge and practice. These two axes in the mandala model will produce the conscious ego. If these two axes are both balanced, it would generate nutrition to the ego. The ego would the gradually changes into the self, representing the intergeneration for these two axes; On the contrary, if these two axes are not both balanced, this conflict will cause the ego to deteriorate and idle, representing the inter-restriction for these two axes. However, intergeneration or inter-restriction is affected by the four combinations of human life. They are virtue and practice, practice and desire, desire and knowledge and knowledge and virtue. We should ask ourselves the question: how we face and place the four dimensions which converge and integrate ourselves on earth? By doing so, one’s life naturally comes up with the self transited from the ego, attaining the ideal life of sanctification. Accordingly, the kungfuism includes two axes and four dimensions, which can be discussed in combination with the Ying and Yang Theory of as follows. The two axes form the property of the ego and, they are earth in the center, referring to that the ego has its own foundation and serves as the foundation for a social person. The four dimensions are flexible (water), growable (wood), combustible (fire) and sharp (metal), referring to the four basic properties for human and they keep changing. The Book of Changes considers the four dimensions＂ as the four phenomena taking place in the daily life between the Yin and Yang interplay. Carl Gustav Jung has pointed out that the four dimensions have touched the deepest bottom of the human's unconsciousness, and continue to have a strong impact on it. For this reason, the representation of the four dimensions is universal to the human. In the present paper, the author proposes the path of virtuous circle of the self that from Confucian ethics therapy and its theory can be developed. The Confucian ethics therapy also offers practice, facilitating the meticulous inspection and coping in the life world. The kungfuism can connect the micro world to life world, with the aim to solve the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem in terms of both psychotherapeutic and counseling perspectives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202005-202006010003-202006010003-47-84,58,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Using Cluster analysis to Explore the Relation Between Dual-Axis Model of Optimism/Pessimism and Mental Adjustment,"Su-Yi Chao, Kun-Hu Chen","Behavioral coping, expectancy, mental adjustment, cluster analysis, optimism/pessimism","Optimism is a crucial feature in Positive Psychology. Optimistic individuals expect good things to happen. In contrast, pessimistic individuals expect bad things to happen. Optimists and pessimists differ in many ways that have varying degrees of impact on their mental adjustment. In the past studies, optimistic and pessimism were regarded as the two extremes of continuous dimension. Researchers critiqued Scheier and Carver's (1985) theory of optimistic orientations overemphasized individuals' positive expectancy, neglected adaptive behaviors or damaging behaviors that extend beyond the expected beliefs (Norem & Chang, 2002). In other words, Scheier and Carver (1985) ignored mutual influences between beliefs and behaviors, as well as underestimated the possibility of various outcome behaviors. Accordingly, researchers used a variety of statistical methods to prove that optimism and pessimism should be regarded as two dimensions (Kubzansky, Kubzansky, & Maselko, 2004; Mehrabian & Ljunggren, 1997). Furthermore, Chou and Chen (2017) addressed that different combinations of expectations and coping would demonstrate different functions in mental adjustment. They adopted ＂positive/ negative expectations＂ as well as ＂engagement /disengagement＂ as two dimensions based on the variable-centered approach to distinguish optimism/pessimism to ＂functional optimism＂, ＂dysfunctional optimism＂, ＂functional pessimism＂ and ＂dysfunctional pessimism＂ Furthermore, Chou and Chen (2017) found that each type of optimism /pessimism played different roles in metal adjustment. For examples, functional optimism and dysfunctional optimism positively predicted to satisfaction of life, functional pessimism negatively predicted to satisfaction of life. Functional pessimism was the best predictor to depressed and anxious symptoms. Dysfunctional optimism was the best predictor to procrastination. However, Asendorpf (2014) critiqued the paradigms of optimism studies that have generally adopted the variable-centered approach (Asendorpf, 2014); for example, Asendorpf (2014) addressed that the variable-centered approach might easily neglect the uniqueness of each individual, whereas the person-centered approach could produce trait clusters that meet ecological validity and demonstrate the behavioral characteristics related to an individual's psychological features. Thus, the study proposed while understanding the characteristics of optimistic and pessimistic traits, researchers should involve expectancy beliefs and behavioral coping as well as adopt the person-centered approach. Accordingly, the study established a scale that reflects positive and negative value of expectancy beliefs and behavioral coping, as well as further explores the differences in their mental adjustment. Study 1 sampled a total of 169 college students (female=40.8=%, male=59.2%) and conducted item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, criterion-related validity to examine the reliability and validity of ＂Dual-Axis Model of Optimism/Pessimism Scale-I, DAMOPS-I.＂ The results showed that four subscales of DAMOPS-I have good reliability and validity. Study 2 enlarged the sample variability, the sample size and rewriting some contents of items, which involving a total of 639 college students (female = 54.9%, male = 44.8%). As Study 1, Study 2 conducted item analysis, exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, criterion-related validity to examine the reliability and validity of ＂Dual-Axis Model of Optimism/ Pessimism Scale-II, DAMOPS-II. ＂ The result indicated that the four subscales of DAMOPS-II have good reliability and validity. Furthermore, Study 2 adopted cluster analysis based on two dimensions (i.e., positive/ negative expectancy and positive/negative coping behaviors) to distinguish five clusters, namely Functional Optimism, Medium Optimism, Medium Pessimism, Dysfunctional Pessimism, and Self-Handicapping. The results of Study 2 showed five types of optimism/pessimism have different levels of mental adjustment. Both of ＂Functional Optimism＂ and ＂Medium Optimism＂ had a great mental adjustment outcome. ＂Medium Pessimism＂ showed the greatest outcome within three pessimistic clusters. ＂Dysfunctional Pessimism＂ showed heightened vulnerability to mental adjustment (e.g., higher levels of depressed and anxious symptoms, lower level of life satisfaction). ＂Self-Handicapping＂ demonstrated a highest tendency to procrastinate in five clusters.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202005-202006010003-202006010003-85-125,58,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Exploring Multicultural Counseling Practice Experiences of Counseling Psychologists: The Case of Female New Immigrant Clients,Yi-Han Wang,"multicultural counseling, Female new immigrant clients, multicultural counseling competencies, immigrant counseling","It is highly valued that psycho-therapists should be competent in multicultural issues in counseling process. However there has been a lack of awareness among the counseling professionals regarding cultural differences between various ethnicities since 1960s. Therefore a kind of new counseling approach which was more appropriate to minority clients' experiences should be developed. Under globalization, more and more women have been migrating into Taiwanese society by marriage. These women, named as ＂female new immigrants＂, mainly come from Mainland China and Southeast Asia countries. Their population grew from almost 8,000 in 1998 to around 556,000 in 2019. These women have been observed encountering multiple difficulties from cultural adjustment to discrimination. Their lives in the new home might be overshadowed by the association of their marriages with commodification, marriage agent's intervention, negative media images of ＂foreign brides＂, traditional gender norms, and racialization. Hence the welfare of female new immigrants is in urgent need of full attention. They might need help or services from counseling psychologists, but there is not so much discussion of counseling training regarding multicultural counseling competencies in Taiwan. The issue is a matter of concern for counseling professionals, and this paper thus explores the counseling experiences of 7 counseling psychologists with these women. The focus is mainly on the useful principles related to counseling practice with female new immigrant clients. The qualitative data was collected from a multicultural counseling perspective and was analyzed using Thematic Analysis method. First, it is found that it is not easy for female new immigrants to access counseling services mainly because of language barrier. Second, five counseling principles have been generated: (1) Simple and straight forward language should be conducted especially while reflecting emotion and structuring; (2) While understanding these women's presenting issues, their life context in Taiwan as well as their native culture need to be equally taken into account; (3) Cultural sensitivity is highly recommended to be enhanced by all counseling psychologists. The useful ways may include continuously receiving supervision, taking relative courses, or adapting the systematic approach in counseling; (4) Empowering female new immigrant clients by emphasizing their self-efficacy, recognizing their strength, using their native culture (such as art or language), valuing their learning abilities, and allowing autonomy; and (5) Collaborating with social workers who have expertise in assisting female new immigrant clients to liaison with counseling psychologists, in adopting out-of-office strategies to facilitate supportive systems, as well as in benefiting clients by locating more social resources. This paper finally put forward five recommendations of how multicultural counseling practice should be formulated specifically benefit new female immigrants: (1) Cross-professional collaboration between counseling professionals and social welfare systems should be developed so that female new immigrants can have the chance to be referred to the counseling psychologists and receive appropriate services; (2) it is necessary to include multicultural issues (racial and ethnic group should be contained) in the counseling training programs for the sake of increasing counseling psychologists' competencies and then they can work well with clients from different cultures; (3) counseling psychologists should improve the skill of out-of-office so that they can exercise institutional intervention when necessary; (4) the professional skills of reflection of feelings should be reframed diversely and flexibly in order that counseling psychologists can appropriately show empathy to female new immigrant clients; and (5) it is required to set resources of counseling interpreters so that the female new immigrants who are not fluent in Chinese or Taiwanese can receive counseling services as well.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202005-202006010003-202006010003-127-159,58,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Collaboration and Shared Governance Model of Professionals Who Work on Domestic Violence Cases Involving Child and Youth Protection,Hsiao-Pei Chang,"Collaboration and shared governance, domestic violence involving child and youth protection, multiple professional","The research showed that domestic violence experience has negative impact on individuals, including immediate impact (emotional and behavioral disturbance) and long-term impact (depression, low self-esteem, poor academic achievement, PTSD, and substance abuse). As domestic violence episodes are associated with child and youth protection issues, the complexity of the intervention process will be increased. The nature of domestic violence is multicultural, and many of the services and interventions provided are not entirely suitable for clients or relevant to their day-to-day life experiences. For example, the collaboration between child protection and domestic violence sectors is often problematic. Indeed, the two sectors operate relatively independently and with little integration. However, it is widely recognized that the two sectors need to work more closely together to enhance both adult victims' and children's safety. Since no single agency or professional is able to deal with all the needs of a family alone, the premise of this article is focused on the collaboration and shared governance of professionals to offer comprehensive interventions in order to enhance the likelihood to satisfy the needs of clients and families. The collaboration and shared governance is defined as multiple professional workers from different backgrounds working in cohesion with clients, families, and communities to deliver the highest quality of service. Research and documents have shown that multiple professional collaboration models are not just effective but are also essential for competent, cost-effective, culturally responsive mental health care. The highest quality of service means that multiple professional workers provide coordinated, appropriate, consistent responses aimed at enhancing victim's safety, reducing secondary victimization, and holding abusers to be accountable for their violence. This study aimed at exploring the factors that influence multiple professional workers dealing with the domestic violence involved with child protection and the collaboration and shared governance model. The researcher recruited and invited 21 professionals with over three years of working experience and whose specialty was focused on domestic violence interventions and preventions in government or community agencies. Individual interviews were conducted to gather data, and the data was then analyzed based on the grounded theory and processed by the sequential extractions of open coding, axial coding, and core coding. During the analysis, the core theme was identified as energy of professionals which included three categories: autonomy and flexibility to act, perspectives on problems, and trust development. Autonomy and flexibility to act included understanding the role of each professional, the flexibility between rules/ethics and practice, and the case complexity and caseload. The perspectives on problem included training and professional background, practice experience, personal value and style, and multicultural viewpoint. Trust development included appreciating diverse contributions, transparency and clear communication, and mutual support. Participants reported that the professionals of social welfare in the government should be the one to organize network meetings based on families' needs. All of the professionals who provide services to the family should attend network meetings and perform the necessary tasks for their role. The functions of the network meetings should include facilitating healthy conversations, sharing information, connecting resources, and reaching an intervention agreement. When a suspected case is reported and evaluated on whether it should be open, the network meeting should be held immediately. Network meetings may also be held during the period of intervention or during the moment that the case is evaluated to be closed. The meeting should be held immediately and continuously. The results raised several important implications for training and clinical work. The recommendations from the study include continuing to inspect and be aware of their own energy level as professionals, participating in the network meeting and implementing its true value and meaning, and instilling courage for professionals to walk out of their comfort zone. These recommendations are essential for domestic violence and child protection professionals to collaborate with each other in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202001-202001210011-202001210011-17-49,57,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Experience of Elementary School Counselors Using Art Materials in Child Counseling during the Art Therapy Training Program Training,"Shu-Hui Kuo, Yen-Pai Chen, Chuan-Yung Huang","Art therapy, child counseling and guidance, school counseling, school counselor","In recent years, elementary school mental health needs have been in the spotlight. As demands for student counseling increase, the use of art therapy can be an expandable and flexible approach to child counseling for elementary school counselors. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of using art materials in child counseling by elementary school counselors. The subjects were 15 experienced school counselors who participated in a three-hour art therapy professional training program for eight weeks. The approach adopted in this training program included basic concepts of art therapy, art materials applications and experiences, group discussions, practical work demonstrations, and sharing experiences. The concept of art therapy was learned during the training process, and the trainees returned to their schools to verify the effectiveness of art therapy in child counseling. This study was an explorative, descriptive, and qualitative study. Data was collected from 15 subjects by two focus group interviews after the training program and analyzed using qualitative content. The results of the study showed that art therapy applied to child counseling revealed six major themes and seventeen concepts: (1) Expand the trainee's understanding of children through the creative art process: (a) Enhance trainee's deeper understanding and patience with children, (b) Focus on the present interaction with children while giving feedback; (2) Be present and witness children making changes during the creative art process: (a) Respect the autonomy of children by providing space as needed, (b) Create a positive atmosphere, (c) Accompany children to recover from emotional pain, (d) Develop problem-solving skills; (3) Provide children a safe place to comfort their minds: (a) Break through the limitations of verbal expression and project one's inner world while processing artwork. (b) Provide children a safe space to express and release emotions, (c) Use art materials to connect with one's sensory feelings and emotions; (4) Empower children through art products: (a) Review art products to enhance self-image, (b) Internalize the symbolic meaning of art products; (5) Promote positive therapeutic relationships through the creative art process: (a) Provide opportunities to build relationships, (b) Increase here and now conversations, (c) Gain a closer view into children's inner world with non-verbal approaches; (6) Understand limitations of incorporating art into child counseling: (a) Some children do not like art making, (b) Restrictions of class time affect the arrangement of activities, (c) Art materials may not always be readily accessible. The following were discussed based on the results of the study: (1) Art therapy assists school counselors to enhance their understanding and patience with children, (2) Children have a sense of mastery in the art therapy process, (3) Art therapy is an avenue to self-exploration and empowerment of children through art therapy activity and the use of art materials, (4) Art therapy provides opportunities to promote therapeutic relationships and increase conversations here and now, (5) There are limitations of using art materials in child counseling. The results were compared and contrasted extensively with existing literature, and this study showed that the use of art materials in school counseling provided counselors a way to promote the treatment process and counseling relationships. Finally, based on the research results, this study suggested that multiple methods can be used in researching the experiences of school counselors and using art materials in child counseling for offering complementary insights. Moreover, the applications and suggestions of training institutions and professional development are discussed and proposed in the study.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202001-202001210011-202001210011-51-83,57,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Implementation of Teacher Consultations in Elementary School Counseling: Comparison of a Dual Framework Phenomenal Field,"Li-Chuan Liu, Shu-Chen Kao","teacher consultation, Dual framework, elementary school counseling","With the increase in the number of and diversity in student issues and the recent policy of hiring full-time school counselors in elementary schools, the importance and feasibility of teacher consultation deserves to be explored in depth. Teacher consultation can not only solve students' problems but also improve teachers' abilities to solve students' problems, resulting in primary prevention of school-related problems. The importance of teacher consultation is highlighted by the efficiency and influence of counseling interventions and their ability to prevent future problems. Although counseling practitioners and teachers focus on assisting students' adaptation to school life, it is not easy to successfully conduct teacher consultations. Teacher and counseling practitioners have their own role and position, which further alters the demands and expectations. This in turn widens the gap, making it increasingly difficult to establish cooperation. This study attempts to explore the experiences of both practitioners and teachers in teacher consultation in an attempt to improve their practical knowledge base and establish a clear, feasible path towards teacher consultation. Channeling knowledge will increase the possibility of cooperation and dialogue between teachers and counseling practitioners. Student counseling often works because of students' willingness to cooperate and create a win-win situation for their well-being and others involved in the case. This study is based on grounded theory and primarily focused on the dual framework of counseling practitioners and teachers to investigate the implementation and current status of teacher consultations in elementary schools. Participants included eight professional and experienced teacher consultants as well as seven teacher consultees who had participated in the consultation process. This study employed a qualitative research design. The findings of this study will enhance the understanding of the importance of teacher consultation from the perspectives of both practitioners and teachers to promote cooperation and increase the effectiveness of teacher consultations by examining overlapping experiences. In terms of the factors influencing the teacher consultation process, the study found that the professional commitment of the consultant not only helped the positioning of the self-professional role but also the resolution of the counseling dilemma. However, before conducting a teacher consultation, it was necessary to evaluate the teacher's readiness to consult, traits, and educational beliefs. In addition, teacher consultation involved professional cooperation; thus, mutual subjectivity was an important manifestation of the consulting relationship and also a key factor in maintaining a smooth relationship. Finally, school counseling often needed to be combined with student services provided by other administrative units, in order to not overlook the impact of executive leadership and organizational climate on teacher consultations. There were differences between the counselors' and teachers' consulting experiences. First, the roles of the teachers and counselors were different in terms of their concerns and the assistance they provided. Second, the students' problems were mostly family related, and counselors need to have capacities for consultation with parents in order to assist teachers in their communication with their students' parents. Third, teachers need more specific demonstrations to effectively achieve the consulting objectives. Fourth, both counselors and teachers need to be flexible and open to encourage consultation and cooperation. Finally, in teacher consultations, frequent, flexible, and short-term consultations are more in line with the needs of the situation. Based on the above-mentioned findings, the researchers conducted a comprehensive discussion on the possible ways to improve the effectiveness of teacher consultation and ensure that there are trained and supervised practitioners and school counselors who can handle school and system related issues.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202001-202001210011-202001210011-85-120,57,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Psychologist's Interdisciplinary Collaborations as a Mediator between Role Stress and Job Satisfaction in School Counselors,"Shou-Chun Chiang, Wan-Chen Chen, Yu-Jou Chen, Yi-Shan Hung, Hsiu-Ling Peng","psychologist, job satisfaction, role stress, Interdisciplinary collaborations, school counselors","With the complexity of students' mental issues increasing rapidly during recent years, school guidance counselors are increasingly important and emphasized. However, we still have no research that explores the impact that having psychologists in schools has on school counselors. In this study, we explored the impact of having psychologists in schools on the level of job satisfaction of school counselors. Our research examined the relationships between role stress and job satisfaction of school counselors as well as the mediator role of interdisciplinary collaboration among school counselors and psychologists derived from the 2011 policy that brought psychologists into schools. In the analysis, we applied cluster-stratified sampling to divide Taiwan into four areas: Northern, Middle, Southern, and Eastern areas. We then conducted surveys according to the proportion of the number of schools in the four areas. The first class is county, and the second class is administration area. The participants were junior high school counselors who had worked with psychologists before, and we surveyed 485 school counselors in total. The data analysis included primary and advanced levels - in the primary level, we used descriptive statistics and Pearson's correlation analysis. In the advanced level, we applied structural equation modeling to examine measurement model and structural model. After the model fit was confirmed, we conducted the mediation effects by using the bootstrapping method. This study showed the following results: (1) Among factors in role stress, the score of the score of role conflict was the highest impacting factor, followed by role overload (quality), with role overload (quantity) being the least impacting factor; among factors in interdisciplinary collaboration, the score of professional assistance was the highest impacting factor, followed by collaborative support, with school immersion being the least impacting factor; among factors in job satisfaction, the score of achievement development was the highest impacting factor, followed by professional growth, with interpersonal relationship being the least impacting factor. (2) On the measurement model, the results indicated that the research model fit our data, RMSEA = .064, SRMR = .04, GFI = .97, CFI = .98, IFI = .98, NFI = .96, PCFI = .65, and PNFI = .64. (3) The role stress of school counselors had a significantly negative effect on interdisciplinary collaboration. Also, interdisciplinary collaboration had a significantly positive effect on job satisfaction. (4) interdisciplinary collaboration plays a mediator role between role stress and job satisfaction. On one hand, role stress directly decreases job satisfaction. On the other hand, role stress first negatively associated with interdisciplinary collaboration, which in turn positively associated with job satisfaction. Finally, we suggested that schools should pay more attention to school counselors' role stress and the potential negative impact of interdisciplinary collaboration on their job satisfaction. When school counselors are already under heavy role stress, working with psychologists could turn out to be a negative collaboration, instead of helping school counselors increase their job satisfaction. Additionally, we found out that psychologists tend to provide professional assistance but the level of immersion in schools scored the lowest in regards to collaboration. Thus, we believe that school immersion is important for psychologists who wish to work in the area of school guidance. Future research could add other independent measures into the model to examine the influence of interdisciplinary collaboration between school counselors and psychologists, such as work efficiency, guidance efficiency, or student guidance outcomes. In addition, researchers can also discuss the negative sides of interdisciplinary collaboration, including lack of collaboration awareness, role difference, or school system limitations. Finally, future research could benefit from applying the interdisciplinary collaboration scale on different professionals, particularly social workers, psychiatrists, homeroom teachers, or even administrative officers in order to understand their collaboration impact with school counselors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-202001-202001210011-202001210011-121-148,57,2020,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Balance between Intimacy and Autonomy in Family Relationship,"Sung-Hsien Sun, Hsiang-Ju Shih, Mei-Hsiang Tsai","family relationship, differentiation of self, the balance between intimacy and autonomy, Containing, family boundary","Through family growth experience, people have been seeking for the following answers to the ＂three questions of life＂ in our lives: First, who am I? Second, am I worth being loved? Could I have the ability to love someone? Third, how can I live? What is the meaning of living? The interpersonal theory of psychopathologist Harry Stack Sullivan argues that individuals are influenced by the interpersonal behavioral dynamics of ＂love＂ and ＂power＂ in parent-child relationships. In the family therapy, the concepts of family boundary and self-differentiation all try to respond to the ＂three questions of life＂: the individual all seeking for the balance between independence and intimacy＂ in family relationship. This balance has a very important influence on the individual's personality development. In Chinese culture, the influence of family boundary and self-differentiation on individuals is also different from the Western culture. In Chinese families, individuals seem to have a good physical and mental health in a family relationship that is not fully ＂autonomy＂ but has sufficient ＂intimacy＂. In this published journal, these three research papers reflect the importance of the balance between intimacy and autonomy in family boundary. The titles of the three research papers include: (1) The impact of parental expectations on Taiwanese college students' career indecision: The mediating role of career decision self-efficacy. (2) Effects of a parenting group based on Bowen family systems theory for mothers with young adolescents. (3) Themes, symbols and healing of play therapy: The clinical case of a physically abused child. The implications of the three studies include: (1) Whether an individual could have autonomy in family relations will become a special topic in Chinese families. Under the Chinese culture with the theme of ＂self in relationship＂, individuals are not easy to be completely themselves in the family. This is and importance task that if the counselor could help the client to find his autonomy from the situational context of affective connections. (2) Seeking autonomy is a dialectical balancing process. In family relationships, absolute intimacy or absolute autonomy is not a good family function. Intimacy with autonomous affirmation, control with affective connections, such balance is a philosophy, but also an art. This reflects the ＂dialectical thinking＂ of Chinese culture, which is like Tai Chi. Black contains white and white contains black. In the future, we need more research to understand how to achieve a balance between autonomy and intimacy, and more to reflect the characteristics of Chinese families. (3) Both parents and children need to learn to develop towards differentiation of self. These three papers have different research subjects, including: college students, mothers of adolescents, children suffering from family violence. These subjects included two generations of parents and children in the family. This also shows the importance of paired research. When studying with ＂relationship＂ as the focus, it is more likely to see the positive impact of two generations learning self-differentiation. (4) In the counseling relationship, the ＂containing＂ behavior with both intimacy and autonomy may promote the traumatic recovery of destructive family relations. When intimacy and autonomy are out of balance, invalid family boundary and self-differentiation can be harmful and even traumatic. If the therapist could re-provide a ＂containing＂ relationship of the balance of intimacy and autonomy, it is one way toward trauma recovery. However, this is an importance current issue about how to promote change and transformation in the counseling process in Taiwan's counseling psychology. We need more research to explore. Finally, it is also suggested that more research issues and directions in the future, including: Expect more researchers and practitioners to provide more relevant research results.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201909-201909270012-201909270012-1-15,56,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Impact of Parental Expectations on Taiwanese College Students' Career Indecision: The Mediating Role of Career Decision Self-Efficacy,"Ching-Hua Mao, Ying-Chu Hsu, Tzu-Wei Fang","developmental indecision, parental expectation, Career indecision, indecisiveness, career self-efficacy","When probing into career issues in Taiwan, it is imperative to understand that in terms of social norms, Taiwan is a Chinese collectivist culture, where Taiwanese parents are deeply concerned about their children's career development and heavily involved in their career choices. Therefore, compared to the influence of family in Western individualist culture, the influence of family on career decision-making in Chinese collectivist cultures is worthy of further exploration. To date, very few studies have evaluated the influence of parental expectations on the career decisions of Taiwanese students; therefore, the present study elucidated the effects of parental expectations on children's career indecision. This study examined the impact of parental expectations on developmental indecision and indecisiveness of college students and the mediating effect of career decision self-efficacy. Employing measures of ＂Living up to Parental Expectations＂, ＂Career Decision Self-Efficacy Scale＂, ＂Career Developmental Indecision Questionnaire＂, and ＂Career Indecisiveness Questionnaire＂ as research tools, the researchers used stratified random sampling to select 9 colleges/universities in Taiwan. The questionnaires were administered to 633 university students in eastern, northern, central, and southern Taiwan. The retrieved data were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis to test the research hypotheses. Findings were as follows: (1) Both ＂perceived self-performance (PSP)＂ and ＂living up to parental expectations (LPE)＂ of parental expectation were significant predictors of developmental indecision. The greater the PSP and LPE, the less developmental indecision sampled college students experienced. (2) All the PSP, LPE and PPE of parental expectation were significant predictors of indecisiveness. More PSP and LPE was associated with less indecisiveness among the college students. More ＂perceived parental expectation (PPE)＂ was associated with higher indecisiveness. (3) Both the relation between PSP and career indecision and the relation between LPE and career indecision were completely or partially mediated by career decision self-efficacy. This corroborated the discourse of Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) and suggests that social context, in this case Chinese culture in Taiwanese society, exerts indirect impact on career decision/indecision, mediated by self-efficacy. This study found that PPE, PSP and LPE produced different predictive results for developmental indecision and indecisiveness, which can be used to reinterpret the previous divergent findings on career indecision. In particular, the results of this study demonstrated that parental expectation could be a double-edged sword, being good and bad at the same time. An individual may need to compromise self needs and repress oneself to meet the expectations of parents, leading to the inability to make career choices and being trapped in indecision. On the other hand, parental expectations may also reflect attentiveness and affirmation towards the children, or be seen as a kind of understanding and care. In the latter case, the attainment or fulfillment of parental expectations is a form of recognition, encouraging and motivating the moving-forward of this parent-child consensus. The present study found that career decision self-efficacy plays a mediating role between parental expectations and career indecision. Hence, career counselors are suggested to assist students by enhancing their career self-efficacy, which appears to be effective in reducing career indecision. According to Bandura (1977), the formation of self-efficacy is rooted in four reference points: performance accomplishment, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and emotional arousal. Therefore, when a counselor is meeting with a client, the positive impacts of past successes can be particularly highlighted in the conversation, while exploring important influencers outside the family, such as school teachers or older club members, as these exemplary figures often make up part of the missing function of parents in a child's career development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201909-201909270012-201909270012-17-57,56,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Effects of a Parenting Group Based on Bowen Family Systems Theory for Mothers with Young Adolescents,"Tsai-Pei Chang, Shih-Hua Chang","Bowen Family Systems Theory, differentiation within the mother/child subsystem, parenting group, mothers with young adolescents, emotional maturity","Families with adolescents need to deal with increased anxiety in parent-adolescent relationships and make adjustments to adolescents' psychological development (Carter & McGoldrick, 2005). In Taiwan, mothers are the main carers of children in families (Taiwan Executive Yuan, 2011), and play a major role in the emotional and personality growth of adolescents (Bartle-Haring, Brucker, & Hock, 2002). However, research has pointed out that mothers tend to have huge emotional problems and anxieties with parenting, which might result from inadequate mother-adolescent boundaries, as well as the anxieties of the mothers themselves, family members, and society expectations (Gilbert, 1999). In order to help mothers with adolescents to deal with their parenting anxiety and have better relationships with their adolescent children, some parenting educators and researchers have advocated the application of family system theories in parenting groups (Ham, 2011). This study aimed to examine and explore the effects of a parenting group based on Bowen theory for mothers with young adolescents in Taiwan. An embedded quasi-experimental design of mixed method research was used for the study. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the parenting group on reducing mothers' anxiety toward the parent/ adolescent relationship, enhancing differentiation within the mother/child subsystem, as well as increasing participants' emotional maturity. The secondary purpose of this study was to explore participants' personal experiences and understandings of the parenting group in the changes among oneself, the mother/adolescent relationship, as well as the family systems. The group model consisted of eight two-hour sessions for a total of sixteen hours for eight successive weeks. Participants were eleven mothers with at least one young adolescent child in Taipei, and they participated in either the experimental group or the comparison group. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Quantitative data were pre-test and post-test scores on Chinese versions of the Differentiation in the Family System Scale (DIFS-Chinese version) and Differentiation of Self Inventory-Revised (C-DSI) in each of the two groups. Participants' anxiety toward the mother/adolescent relationship was assessed in the experimental group by a group observer in each group session, and their follow-up scores on the DIFS-Chinese version and C-DSI were collected four weeks after the group ended. Qualitative data were collected by a focus-group interview for participants one week after each of the two groups ended. Mean scores on the group observation assessment showed that participants' anxiety toward the mother/adolescent relationship decreased about 50% in the first and final group sessions. Results of the ANCOVA analyses and dependent t-tests indicated that there were immediate and follow-up effects on increasing differentiation within the mother/child subsystem for the experimental group. However, no immediate or follow-up effects on improving participants' emotional maturity were found. Further, qualitative data were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis, and findings revealed that the parenting group provided participants with assistance in their intrapersonal changes as well as supporting positive changes in their mother/adolescent relationships and in their family systems. In terms of their intrapersonal changes, participants gained insights and made adjustments on their mother roles and expectations to decrease their anxiety and emotional reactivity toward their adolescent children. As for the positive changes in their mother/adolescent relationships, participants made some adjustments in the mother-adolescent boundary. They started to understand and respect adolescent children's autonomy needs and decisions, and tried to make a positive connection with them. Further, their mother-adolescent conflicts dampened. Even though the number of conflicts did not decrease, participants acquired some strategies to make themselves calm down to be able to deal with the conflicts more effectively. In addition, in terms of the changes within their family systems, some participants reported that their husbands' relationships with adolescent children had improved, and others mentioned that interactions with other family members such as their own mothers and another child had also improved. Findings of this study suggested that a parenting group based on Bowen Family Systems Theory can help mothers with young adolescents to decrease their anxiety and improve their differentiation with their adolescent children. Implications of the findings for the parenting group based on Bowen theory as well as suggestions for the future study are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201909-201909270012-201909270012-59-95,56,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"Themes, Symbols and Healing of Play Therapy: The Clinical Case of a Physically Abused Child","Dong-Yann Wu, Tsung-Chain Huang","play themes, Physically abused child, play therapy, symbol","Recent studies have call for an increased attention to use play therapy as a crucial method for the treatment of physically abused children. While much work has been undertaken to examine the relationships between play therapy and treatment efficacy, few studies have addressed the symbolic and healing perspectives of children's play themes. In addition, the dynamic process of the therapeutic relationship has long been neglected. The researchers argued that not only the play behaviors between the sessions, but also the contextual and sequential meanings behind the play themes should be examined. Thus, the present study was aimed to synthesize the existing literature into a more process-oriented model that explains why and how play therapy works for the clients. Based on the approach of Thematic Analysis, the present study explored the repeated play themes from a physically abused child's 15 play sessions. Home-Room teacher, school counselor as well as the client's grandmother's reports were collected to increase data validation. Inter-Rater reliability between two researchers was carefully examined. Researchers read each play sessions' transcriptions and classified concepts based on conditions, contexts, action strategies and results. Researchers also conducted a re-inspection to verify the theoretical structure obtained in the above-mentioned analysis. Attention was placed on whether there was evidence pointing away from the theories obtained. Researchers also conducted continuous modifications and supplementary works based on discussions with scholars in related fields. Five major themes were identified from the data analysis: (1) captivity and escape; (2) go beyond or maintaining boundaries; (3) hide and seek; (4) death and replacement; (5) dialectical relationship between opposites. The researchers not only extracted meaningful themes of the child's play, but also draw attention to why the play behaviors were activated and presented. In addition, the interactions between play themes and the therapeutic relationship were investigated. The symbolic meaning of the play themes was also explored. As the therapeutic process continued, client was more able to contain his inner and outer experiences and allow them to flow. He was less against his teachers or school norms, in addition, he was more able to follow the rules and take responsibility for school assignments. Client's grandmother indicated that he was less provocative and had more positive interactions with her. The results also showed that, when the therapist can work on the client's projective identification, then the client was more likely to move his ＂bad me＂ identification to a more positive self image, that is, he became more realized that ＂bad＂ and ＂good＂ can both exist within himself. He was more able to set up a boundary and forgive the person who abused him. As to the content of his ego development, the client's abilities of competence, integration, interpersonal relationship and the devotion of libido were also improved. The present study adds to the existing literature on the etiology and underlying healing process of play therapy to a Taiwanese physically abused child. This has been done in an effort to increase understanding in Taiwanese families and to test previous conceptualizations and findings based on the available literature, which has typically observed or measured from White, middle-class families in America. This study highlights the importance of incorporating theoretical and methodological advances in the mainstream literature into research with culturally diverse population, while remaining sensitive to the culture-specific issues of Taiwanese - an obvious requirement that has not been met in much of the previous research. Influential reflections as well as practical applications were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201909-201909270012-201909270012-97-130,56,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Self and How It Operates in a Life world: An Existential Phenomenological View,"Shu-Hui Liu, Yung-Jong Shiah, Chih-Hung Wang, Sung-Hsien Sun","situational structure, Be-in-the-world, existential phenomenology, self, identification","In this paper, the self and how it operates in a life world is illuminated in an existential phenomenological view. The situational structure, the result of the co-construction between objective situatedness and transcendent projecting, is analyzed based on analyses of (1) how the world exists, (2) how a person exists, and (3) how a person and the others coexist in the world. Along this line of thinking, self-identification is considered as a verb instead of a noun. It refers to ＂how a person composes, directs, and stars a personal drama in order to display the character image he or she chooses and designs. The practice of self-identification involves the application of I-other-relating strategies and the unfolding of plots and meanings in one's personal drama. A personal drama may be composed of scenes of various fields or from various points of time flow. The core of a drama locates in both (1) what is displayed and perceived on the stage and (2) what is communicated by the composer, director, and star. For each personal drama, all of the supporting actors are the main composer, director, and star in their own personal drama; the main composer, director, and star is a supporting actor in others' personal drama. The current issue includes 5 papers. They are ＂self-identity and self-esteem during different stages of adolescence: the function of identity importance and identity firmness, ＂a case study of the multi-selves conflicts coordination theory and intervention program to a male batterer who values the Chinese face and family,＂＂developing and evaluating the scale for social benefits and losses of deviant behaviors,＂＂using self-regulated theory to understand effective job searching self-regulatory strategies: mid-aged job seekers in Taiwan,＂＂drug offenders learned in the savoring group program.＂These papers showed the following results. At the point of defining character, one needs to: (1) be aware of past decision about one's character definition, (2) appreciate one's past positive experience, (3) arrange the importance and priority of various selves, and (4) clearly define specific content of one's character. At the point of projecting future possibilities, one needs to negotiate and cooperate with the others to come out with mutual-accepted I-other-relating strategies and actions. These may include but not limit to: (1) take the responsibility of whatever result from previous personal drama, (2) with true understanding, pick up the others appropriate for I-other-relating, (3) adjust self-presenting strategies and actions in correspondence of the others, (4) foresee possible benefits and losses for oneself and relating others resulting from the I-other-relating strategies and actions under consideration, (5) adjust understanding about one's situatedness based on the feedback from the others, (6) adjust self-presenting and I-other-relating strategies and actions based on the feedback from the others, (7) negotiate among selves and deal with conflicts among them, (8) cut off the habitual connection with negative past experience, (9) terminate the familiar old personal drama, (10) initiate unfamiliar new personal drama, (11) establish the connection of past-present-future via appreciating the past, savoring the present, anticipate the future. The projecting helps to direct one's personal drama toward avoiding personal losses, protecting one's self-esteem and face, extending positive emotional experience, avoiding hurting others, avoiding disappointing others, taking care of others' needs, and establish mutual-accepted I-other-relating strategies and actions.

Self-Identity and Self-Esteem during Different Stages of Adolescence: The Function of Identity Importance and Identity Firmness,Kun-Hu Chen,"self-esteem, identity importance, Adolescence, identity firmness","Adolescence is often regarded as a transitional stage between childhood and (emerging) adulthood. Adolescence also is viewed as a stage with heightened risks to a healthy development (Adams, Gullotta, & Markstrom-Adams, 1994; Roberts, Lewinsohn, & Seeley, 1996). Erik Erikson (1968) postulated that identity formation is the most important developmental task during adolescence. Researchers also suggested that a more confirmed sense of identity is more likely to lead to positive mental health (Erikson & Erikson, 1950; Marcia, 2002) and optimal psychological functioning (e.g., self-esteem; well-being) (Adler, Lodi-Smith, Philippe, & Houle, 2016; Lillevoll, Kroger, & Martinussen, 2013; Schwartz et al., 2011; Waterman, 1992). Besides, self-esteem is also an important developmental issue in the field of adolescence, reflected to as self-worth or self-image, is the global evaluative dimension of self (Harter, 2006). Researchers have been interested in self-esteem changes during adolescence in the long run (e.g., Harter, 2006; Kling, Hyde, Showers, & Buswell, 1999). For example, researchers generally found that self-esteem often decreases when children make the transition from elementary school to junior high school (Hawkins & Berndt, 1985; Twenge & Campbell, 2001). Robins and his colleagues also indicated that this decrease in self-esteem might take place during life transitions (e.g., from elementary school to junior high school, from junior high school to high school; from high school to college) (Robins, Trzesniewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002). In the past, several studies demonstrated that low self-esteem can influence adolescent mental health and psychopathology (e.g., depression, eating disorders, delinquency…) (Kuhlberg, Peña, & Zayas, 2010; Harter, 1993; Unger, Kipke, Simon, Montgomery, & Johnson, 1997; Usher, Zahn-Waxler, Finch, & Gunlicks, 2000). Numerous studies investigated adolescent self-esteem in various ways (e.g., Baldwin & Hoffman, 2002; Prinstein & Dodge, 2010; Roustit, Campoy, Chaix, & Chauvin, 2010), but the role of self-identity in self-esteem changes during adolescence has relatively received little attention. Based on Erikson's belief that a more confirmed sense of identity is more likely to lead to positive psychological adjustment (Erikson & Erikson, 1950) and help individuals ensure the direction, purpose, and meaning of life, this study proposed that all aspects of identity firmness are key predictors to self-esteem at all substages of adolescence. In addition, as different stages highlight different needs for the various aspects of identity, this study hypothesized that, in early and middle adolescence, social and image identity importance would significantly predict self-esteem; while in late adolescence, only personal identity importance would be significantly related to self-esteem. To examine the above hypotheses, four stepwise regression analyses of four serial studies on self-esteem using the aspects of identity importance and firmness as predictors were conducted in three different age levels of adolescents. Study 1 (N = 1,285 participants from junior high, high school, college students) generally supported the hypothesis that identity firmness could predict adolescent self-esteem. That is, the results of Study 1 showed that there were different patterns on identity importance in predicting self-esteem among three adolescent stages, but same patterns on identity firmness (i.e., personal identity firmness, social identity firmness) in predicting self-esteem among three adolescent stages. Study 2 (N = 203 participants from three different colleges) successfully replicated the findings of Study 1. In Study 3 (N = 185 undergraduate students) and Study 4 (N = 146 undergraduate students), the measurement of identity importance and identity firmness was revised. Again, the findings were consistent with those of the previous two studies. In sum, this study suggested identity importance and identity firmness are crucial factors contributing to adolescent self-esteem.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201905-201905310010-201905310010-27-57,55,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
A Case Study of the Multi-Selves Conflicts Coordination Theory and Its Intervention Program to a Male Batterer Who Values the Chinese Face and Family,"Charles Chen, Kuang-Hui Yeh","Chinese self and personality, indigenous psychology, domestic violence, counseling and psychotherapy, marital violence","This research analyzes the process of how the Multi-Selves Conflicts Coordination Theory and its intervention program facilitates a Taiwanese male perpetrator ＂King＂ who committed marital partner violence, violated the domestic law of Taiwan. He was referred from the district court to stop his physical violence, and to achieve the multi-selves balance and marital harmony. We modified Dr. Yang K.-S.'s Chinese Four Self Theory and Dr. Chen, P.-H.'s Self-Relation Coordination Counseling Model, Self-Coordination Theory and Process to develop the Multi-Selves Conflicts Coordination Theory (MSCCT) in the couple relationship counseling. The MSCCT is proposed to explain that the conflicts of the male violent perpetrator King's multi-selves may cause marital conflicts, spoken violence, and even severe physical violence. King wanted to play both the role of father-familistic self and the role of husband-relational self simultaneously. However, the conflicts of these two selves leaded to nervous, anxious, angry, hateful emotions, which may cause the marital conflicts and severe physical violence. The MSCCT intervention program focuses to inhibit the strong aspect of self and to facilitate the weak aspect of self to a balance condition. A qualitative research approach of case study method is conducted to analyze the client King's crime documents, the content of protection command, the transcripts of 10 session's group therapy videos, two individual interviews videos after the group therapy, one telephone follow-up interview after 6 months, and the research notes of the therapist. The results show that, during the therapeutic process, the client King was aware of his inner conflicts of multi-selves related to different relational roles gradually. The therapeutic aims were to inhibit his three strong selves on individualistic, familistic, and other-oriented aspects, and facilitate the weakest relational self. It was found that the client King increased his empathy toward his wife. The previous order of his multi-selves, which were familistic self, individualistic self, other-oriented self, and relational self, was changed to relational self, familistic self, individualistic self, and other-oriented self. The multi-selves of the client King became harmonious than before. The coping behavior toward marital conflicts of the client King changed, marital violence vanished, the multi-selves of the client King remained balance harmoniously even after 6 months of the multi-selves conflicts coordination intervention program. The main factors that may cause the change of the client King may come from the multi-selves conflicts coordination intervention program, the client King's personal positive traits, and group therapeutic dynamics. The researcher discusses and suggests the ideas of indigenous concepts, such as the Chinese face and the familism that may play a vital role in the therapeutic process of reduced marital violence. The MSCCT and its intervention program, as a new prevention way for marital violence, provides to all different kinds of therapists, social workers, and other mental health professional workers. In the near future, the program may be used to different kinds of domestic violence, such as parent to child, man to old parents, siblings to each other, heterosexual intimate partners to each other, and same-sex intimate partners to each other. The intervention program may be used not only in the group therapy context but also in the individual therapy context. The linkage between the male violent perpetrator's inner multi-selves conflicts and his marital violence behaviors is obvious in this case study. In the helping profession position, if the therapist can help the male violent perpetrator to achieve a balance condition of his inner multi-selves, martial conflicts and severe physical violence may be prevented, in turn leading to that all of the potential victims, such as women, child, and teens could be protected.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201905-201905310010-201905310010-59-95,55,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Developing and Evaluating the Scale for Social Benefits and Losses of Deviant Behaviors,Chung-Chin Wu,"Deviant behaviors, social losses, social benefits","Social Learning Theory, General Strain Theory, and Social Control Theory are three sociopsychological theories, which proposed to account for deviant behaviors. Social Learning Theory argued that differential reinforcement of behaviors, definition in favor of crime, the imitation of criminal models, and attached to deviant peer are four key influential factors leading to deviant behaviors. Deviant behaviors could be positively and negatively encouraged to be prolonged. For instance, someone who initially smoks may be encourage for his/her brave, and it may be also thought that is the way keeping his/her friendship. How people define certain behaviors as good or bad may be decided by his or her propensity of committing criminality. Moreover, deviant peer may also provid a model for imitating their deviant behaviors. Further, people who attaches to deviant peer may also learn deviant motivation and definition. General Strain Theory argued that failure to achieve positively valued goals (e.g. did not get good grade), inconsistent between expectations and achievements, removal of positive stimuli (e.g. divorce), and appearance of negative stimuli (e.g. been bullied) are crucial for deviant behaviors. Both theories try to find out encouraged factors for deviant behaviors. Instead, Social Control Theory proposes that relationships among individuals, commitments, values, norms, and beliefs prevents someone from deviant behaviors. Therefore, if moral beliefs (what is this?) are internalized, people will voluntarily limit their intention to commit deviant behaviors. This theory tries to understand the possible factors to reduce the likelihood of deviant behaviors. However, measurement of these three theories were rarely investigated the processes of social benefits and losses for expected behavioral outcome. The positive effects of negative reinforcement to deviant behaviors and inhibition effects of deviant behaviors to others feeling (social losses) were rarely measured in related measurement in empirical studies. This study constructed social benefits evaluation items based on Social Learning Theory and General Strain Theory to respectively capture positive effects of positive and negative reinforcements on deviant behaviors. Meanwhile, items for measuring social losses, based on social control theory, were designed to capture inhibition effects of affective connections to important others on deviant behaviors. This study included eighth grader as participants to evaluate the reliability and validity of social benefits and losses scale. Results showed: (1) Model of two second-order factors consisting four factors fitted to the observations. (2) Social benefits evaluation processes included pursing peers' recognition and avoiding negative life events. (3) Social losses evaluation processes included losses evaluation for attached to peers and parents. (4) ＂Pursing peers' recognition＂ and ＂avoiding negative life events＂ were considered as driving force, and there was only ＂attached to parents＂ was considered as pull force for inhibiting deviant behaviors. Results clearly showed that in evaluation process of social benefits, adolescence may try to get recognition from peers by means of committing deviant behaviors. It was also possible that they tried to unpleasure and pressure accompanied by avoiding negative life events throughout engaging in deviant behaviors. As to social losses evaluation process, loss evaluation of attachment to peer and parents were clearly different. Adolescence who considered more about peers' thought were more likely to consider parents' negative feeling. According to the results, further researches could not only reexamine the reliability and validity of this scale, but also could incorporate other theoretical variables to examine the fitness to the data. In practical, teachers are encouraged to conduct various teaching activities based on evaluation foci of social benefits and social losses, to weaken the driving force of deviant behaviors and reinforce the pull force to inhibit deviant behaviors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201905-201905310010-201905310010-97-121,55,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Application of Self-Regulation Theory to Understand Effective Job Searching Self-Regulatory Strategies: Mid-Aged Job Seekers in Taiwan,"Hsiang-Ju Chen, Chingju Grace Chen","self-regulation, Job search behavior, mid-aged employees","All industries are going through dramatic change with the current rapid technological developments. Some job positions disappeared while newer positions are created to respond to the new changes of that specific industry. Employees are much more likely to seek new positions to fit with their own abilities in this rapid changing labor market instead of staying in the same positions. As a result, turnover rates also increase to respond to the ever-changing work settings. Meanwhile, the increasing aging population and decreasing birthrate also adds to the complexity of the career markets and the demands on the society as a whole. In this respect, the cost of social security benefits and medical care will increase significantly, while the supporters of the social security system will decrease noticeably. As a result, current midlife employees are responsible for supporting the nation's economy. In comparison to their parents' generation, the midlife population needs to work longer in order to compensate for the labor force shortages. In the meantime, there is an unspoken age limitation in the labor market in Taiwan which is one of the obstacles in the job search process for mid-aged employees. Mid-aged employees need effective job search strategies to compensate the age limitation. The purpose of this study was to explore mid-aged employees' effective job search strategies. Job search includes exploring potential job opportunities, preparing resumes, sending resumes, participating in interviews, evaluating job alternatives, and choosing a job from the alternatives. This dynamic process requires the job seekers to be adjustable in their job searching strategies (e.g. the quality of resumes and presentations in interviews) in order to optimize the job search outcomes (e.g. the second interview, or job offers), or to enhance employment outcomes (e.g. higher salary or better person-organization fit (Saks, 2005)). Therefore, this study defined the job search as a self-regulation process (Kanfer, Wanberg, & Kantrowitz, 2001). That is, the job seekers have to regulate between job search behaviors and feedbacks from the labor market. Guided by the Grounded Theory, this qualitative research study applied in-depth interviews to collect data from 8 participants. Participants are chosen through purposive sampling and snowball sampling processes. The research findings showed two models of job search process that corresponded to the participants' age. The participants were grouped in two age categories. One group was above 44 years old (senior group) while the other group was below 44 years old (junior group). The strategies that the junior group utilized to seek employment opportunities are much more active and intense, which resulted in more frequent responses from the employers and a better fit for both parties. These proactive job searching behaviors in the junior group includes three self-regulatory strategies: (1) exploring the environment, such as gathering information of job vacancy, companies, and the specific industries; (2) clarifying and revising, such as revising the curriculum vitae according to the reaction from the job market which would increase the job search intensity, job search clarity, job search self-efficacy and establishing a list of their goal-companies; and (3) reviewing and reflecting on the self and the environmental factors, such as setting up evaluation criteria to evaluate the personal performance in the job search process, attributes that cause failures to be selected as the finalist, and rectify their weaknesses. The junior group used these three strategies interchangeably to overcome the age barrier. This research study seeks to understand the effective job search strategies from the job seekers' successful experiences. The present study has considerable implications for both employees and employers. Through this research finding, we know that employment conditions are almost transparent on the internet and are easy to access by the job seekers. Human Resource divisions should treat the content of relevant information with caution. In addition, it is necessary for both midlife employees and employers to regularly updated the employment exceptions of the industry. Employers can retain the current employees in order to cut-down on new employee orientation and adjustment expenditures. These strategies would ensure employees to obtain the best employment conditions in the industry. Implications for career counselors, adult learning educators, and Human Resource divisions are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201905-201905310010-201905310010-123-160,55,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
What Drug Offenders Learn in the Savoring Group Program,"Hsaio-Feng Cheng, Hsiu-Ching Chen","savoring, Drug addiction, drug offenders, focus group interview, perceived control","Drug-related crimes and drug addiction are global issues. Assisting drug offenders in how to enrich multiple positive emotions, enhance a better control in life, to reduce the recurrence of drug addiction in order to seek pleasure during their sentences, and to maintain a relatively stable psychological and cognitive status were the main concerns of the present study. The purpose of this research was to understand the savoring concepts, perceived control and savoring strategies that drug offenders learn in the savoring group program. The program was designed to enhance the positive emotions of drug offenders and increase a sense of control in their own life. Participants were recruited from a prison and a total of 12 male offenders volunteered to participate in the study. The average age was 39 years old, and the average period of imprisonment was 17 months. Participants were all recidivists and long-term drug users. There were three cores in the savoring group program: savoring concepts and experiences, a four-factor model of perceived control, and the savoring strategies. The savoring group program included eight sessions, each session lasting for approximately 90 minutes and took place twice a week. In the data collection process, participants were randomly assigned to two groups, with 6 participants in each group. Two interviews were given at the mid-term and at the end of the savoring group program (totallying four interviews) for the participants to be included into the the focus group interviews. There were a total of 4 focus group interviews and each one took about 100 minutes (2 med-term interviews and 2 the end interviews). The data from interviews were analyzed by the phenomenological method. Results of what the participants learned and how they changed in the savoring group program were as follows: First, in regards to the conversion of negative events and emotions: Participants changed their original negative inner-situation to a positive inner-situation, therefore they could create positive self-talk towards themselves. They also experienced the actual, at the moment experience through recognizing and clarifying between the past, present and future. Second, in regards to generating and continuation of savoring: Participants modified and expanded their cognitive schemas such as what was real happiness and how to get it, generating a new happiness cycle in their mind. Savoring experiences are similar to an outward migration which participants started to savor by oneself in the beginning, and then by experiencing through interacting with others. Third, in regards to the savoring strategies: Which included ＂sharing with others,＂ ＂at-the-moment concentration,＂ ＂self-admiration,＂ and ＂recognition of good occurrances.＂ ＂Sharing with others＂ and ＂at-the-moment concentration＂ were included in the ＂savoring the moment,＂ while ＂self-admiration＂ was part of ＂anticipation,＂ and ＂recognition of good occurrances＂ belonged to ＂reminiscing.＂ Conclusions showed that the process of savoring could be understood through a four-factor model of perceived control, and savoring experiences through the past, present and future of one's life. According to the above, suggestions were as follows: an experience-based savoring group program should be created to expand the positive emotions among drug offenders, such as gratitude, peace, joy, and hope. Continuing to practice savoring would improve self-awareness and interpersonal relationship. Teaching savoring strategies should be a step-by-step process, allowing for the easier strategies to be taught first, such as sharing with others and at-the-moment concentration. For future research, there are two suggestions. One was to conduct quantitative research assessing the effect of a savoring group grogram. Another is to examine the continuous relationship between savoring and relapse. Finally, the limitations of the present research are discussed, which included the strict entry and exit controls, which compelled the researcher to be a teacher, an interviewer, and one of the data collectors during the research process in order to reduce the number of people entering the prison. This situation might lead to some errors in data collection.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201905-201905310010-201905310010-161-195,55,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"Developing Self-cultivation Counseling Psychology Theories and Empirical Studies Based on the Chinese Cultural Traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism: Towards Self-enlightenment Psychotherapy","Yung-Jong Shiah, Kwang-Kuo Hwang","psychology of self-cultivation, self-enlightenment, Buddhism and Taoism, Confucianism, self-cultivation, indigenous counseling psychology","The article presents four statements as follows. (1) Reasons for Chinese counseling psychology dilemma and calling for indigenous psychotherapy theories. (2) The maintenance/strength of self is a very core concept in Western psychology and is particularly relevant to egoism, a process that draws on the hedonic principle in pursuit of desires. Contrary to this and based on the three major Chinese cultural traditions, Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism, a self-enlightenment cultivating process aims to minimize or extinguish the desired self, leading to authentic and durable happiness. The self concepts based on the Chinese cultural traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism could open new counseling psychology theories. For the reason, the article presents the three self-enlightenment models based on the three major Chinese philosophies. The universal Mandala Model of Self (MMS) was developed to describe the well-functioning self in various cultures. The MMS is suitable for analyzing the structure of Chinese philosophies to construct the SEM. The ego and self-enlightenment aspects of psychological self-functioning and their underlying processes are compared, drawing on the four concepts of the MMS: biology, ideal person, knowledge/wisdom and action. ＂Self＂ is a psychological term, based on the MMS, the self is the locus of empirical experience, and it takes various actions depending on the social context. It also engages in reflexivity and wisdom when blocked from attaining its goals. The wisdom contained in the personal stock of knowledge can lead individuals to act intelligently in various social contexts. According to the MMS, one important characteristic of individuals is the ability to engage in agency-oriented reflexivity on the meaning of life. People in different cultures exhibit different kinds of wisdom when they think about spirituality, the meaning of their life, and their morality. Individuals' attempts to define their own moral conscience create a normative wisdom that circulates within the society. Confucian three-layered Mandala Model of Self (MMS) of the self-cultivation (ordinary people, scholar and king), Buddhist three-layered (MMS of the self-cultivation (non-Buddhist, Śrāvaka/Pratyeka Buddha and Buddha) and an inward multilayer-stereo MMS based on the Book of Changes are presented. (3) The current special issue include five papers that echo for the three self-enlightenment models based on the Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The first paper used the concepts of four windows, four mirrors, compass and black hole of religion into clinical application on the way of self-enlightenment process. The second paper developed the Grief Healing Model of the funeral rituals based on the Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism to elucidate how the Chinese ethics of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism can be used for grief healing. The third paper found that integration of cross-time-and-space experience increased the positive relationship between adult children and aging parents in terms of gratitude and ＂Ren-Rang＂ behavior. The fourth paper focused the indigenous psychodramatic model in Chinese family relational issues arising from bi-cultural conflict. Based on the Confucian and Buddhist self-enlightenment models, the filial piety and successfully managing close relationships are required by the self-enlightenment process in order to attain the goodness of king and Buddha levels. The final paper illustrated the experience of doubling in psychodrama leading to increased empathy ability. Based on the Confucian, Buddhist and Taoist self-enlightenment models, the empathy ability is needed for the self-cultivation process. (4) Based on these three self-enlightenment models, the construction of self-cultivation counseling theories and their practice could be implemented. Although more research is needed on this front, it is hoped that we will open significant new avenues for mental health and unravel the secret of why Chinese cultural traditions of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism has lasted for thousands of years.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201901-201902180004-201902180004-1-20,54,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"Four Windows, Four Mirrors, Compass and Black Hole of Religion: The Mandala Model of Religion and Self Applied to Counseling",Nam-Sat Chang,"mandala model, religion, black hole, Axis mundi, individual agency","The author uses the analogies of windows, mirrors, compass and black hole derived from the Mandala Model of Religion and Self to analyze religious beliefs and acts. To begin with, the meaning of religion is compared to a window and a mirror. The window offers a view into ＂the micro-world of doctrine＂, while the mirror reflects an individual's ＂intuitive cognition＂. In religious realist perspective, religion functions as a window by which the believers get to look into the outside world, into the worlds of myths, miracles, fairy tales and mysteries. They get to see things from the perspective of these other worlds and explain how their faith was shaped. This allows them to critique their own world and in the process to be transformed at a deep level. In the positivist perspective, religion serves as a mirror that reflects back to the viewers what they already believe. It is a powerful mirror, providing divine sanction for people's beliefs, values and behavior, but unfortunately that's all it does in most cases. Besides, based on the Phenomenology of Religion, Mircea Eliade's study of the archetype of the dynamic axis mundi shows that there is always a distinction between the sacred and the profane in all religions. In life-world, the rites or sanctified activities could define the sacred fields. The images of Eliadian axis mundi such as the Kabbalah Tree of Life, Mount Olympus in Greek mythology and the Buddhist mandala depicting a central Buddha figure surrounded by groups of Bodhisattvas implies the hierarchical structure composed of all the various roles in ＂believers' life-world＂. Given that ＂moral compass＂ refers to a person's ability to judge what is right and wrong and act accordingly, the compass of religion provides a system of behavioral guidelines for society and helps to maintain social stability by binding people to the normative aspects of their society. Because religious believers accept the view which set all human activities within the compass of religion, the author draws an analogy between religious axis mundi and resettable geomantic compass. Finally, the author uses ＂black hole＂ to symbolize the suspension of assumptions about the ultimate reality, as well as the ＂individual agency＂ of religion founders. There is a unfathomable ＂black hole＂ at the faith-demanding center of life-world where ＂God＂ should be. The black hole is especially an analytical simile of cult or new religions guided by self-proclaimed prophet. Regarding the counseling application of the Mandala Model of Religion and Self, the analogies of windows, mirrors, compass and black hole are in the I, II, III and IV quadrants respectively. The analogies in each quadrant can be classified into four categories based on its relationship with other quadrants. The analogies of windows can be classified into ＂scenery from moving car window＂, ＂lighting of skylight＂, ＂picture seen through prison window＂ and ＂wind of the wind＂. Mirrors are classified into ＂clear reflecting mirror＂, ＂mirror of ideas＂, ＂mirror of anxiety＂ and ＂mirror turned outward＂. Black hole can be divided into ＂above black hole＂, ＂inner accretion disk of a black hole＂, ＂outer accretion disk of a black hole＂ and ＂black hole itself＂. Compasses are classified into ＂online compass＂, ＂fengshui compass＂, ＂reassembled compass＂ and ＂re-enchantment compass＂. The Mandala Model of Religion and Self with 16 analogies provides professional counsellors and religious clients a universal, symbolic, pictorial and thus lucid platform to develop a typology of religious mechanisms, leading to the consensus on a framework for the assessment of client's religious beliefs and acts, and help religious people to walk on the path of equilibrium and harmony.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201901-201902180004-201902180004-21-58,54,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"The Grief Healing Model of the Funeral Rituals Based on Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism","Wen-Chia Chung, Yi-Fen Kuo, Yung-Jung Shiah","Confucian ethical healing, grief healing, the funeral rituals of Confucianism, the tasks of grieving, funeral rituals, Taoism and Buddhism","＂Death＂ is an issue that people can't avoid discussing, and funeral rituals can help the bereaved overcome the sadness and lessen the suffering when facing the death of a loved one. Currently, most grief healing theories are proposed by Western scholars. In Taiwan, most domestic grief healing theories discuss the influential factors of grief, the task adjustments of grief, and the analysis of condolence experiences. However, little research focuses on how the bereaved go through funeral rituals to find peace. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to propose ＂The Grief Healing Model of the Funeral Rituals of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (GHMFRCTB)＂. In this model, the fundamental issue is to put Confucian ethical healing into practice in our daily life, which includes the harmonious ethic relationship with the deceased, the ghost, and God. The psychological reaction to grief in the culture of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism would be sorrow, reluctance, respect, compliance, and awe. The coping skills of the funeral rituals would be spiritual return, bathing and providing meals, mourning, burial, Tsu-Ku-Fu-Chi, setting memorial tablets, and worshiping regularly. ＂Spiritual return＂ means to let the soul of the deceased return to their body and realize the truth that their relatives passed away. ＂Bathing and providing meals＂ means that the bereaved treat the deceased with respect and not to lose that because of death. ＂Mourning＂ means the bereaved should follow the tradition rules to express condolence. In this situation, people won’t hurt themselves because of too much sadness. ＂Burial＂ means the deceased are accompanied by the bereaved to the graveyard and are buried. It also means the bereaved and the deceased have been separated, not to interfere with each other anymore. ＂Tsu-Ku-Fu-Chi＂ means the worship after burying. It indicates that the deceased change from human to Gods and bless the descendants. ＂Setting memorial tablets＂ means welcoming the part of the soul of the deceased back home. It shows that life is endless and the bereaved can remember their ancestors through memorial tablets. ＂Worshiping regularly＂ means designing the different rituals according to the seasons in order to express their missing. The four tasks of grieving are to accept the reality of the loss, to work through the pain and grief, to adjust to a new environment, and to find an enduring connection with the deceased while moving forward with life. The sign of recovery from grief would be filial piety, ancestor-venerating, grief relief, and continuing bonds. ＂Filial piety＂ means to treat the parents and the deceased well during funeral rituals, which is according to the conventional rules to finish funerals completely. ＂Ancestor-venerating＂ means teaching people not to forget their ancestors and origins; then, family members can appreciate their ancestors' contributions naturally. ＂Grief relief＂ means using funeral rituals to let the bereaved realize and accept the truth that their relatives passed away and mitigate the sadness in their mind. ＂Continuing bonds＂ means offering many kinds of sacrifices to gods or ancestors to regularly maintain the relationship with ancestors. Furthermore, funeral rituals could create meaning-making and utilize the values of Confucian culture to release and modulate suffering, in order to maintain the ethical order of the family and keep their ethical relationship in harmony. In this way, the bereaved and the deceased can continue to maintain their relationship and show the ability to create harmonious ethical relationships meaningfully. In conclusion, the GHMFRCTB could offer explanations to the healing effects caused by funeral rituals of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Finally, the possible clinical applications and directions for future research are suggested.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201901-201902180004-201902180004-59-89,54,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Construct of Capacity of Integrating Cross-time-and-space Experience and Its Effect on Relationship between Adult Children and Aging Parents,"Tzu-Chun Kao, Kuang-Hui Yeh, Wen-Tso Ho","adult child-parent relationship, Adult children, parent-children conflict, integrating cross-time-and-space experience","Previous studies on parent-child conflicts majorly focused on parent-adolescent interactions and take cognitive improvement training as the solution. However, in an aging society today, communication and conflict issues and their solutions are obviously different between adult children's and teenager's relationships with their parents. Based on decades of interactions with parents, adult children have more common memories and understanding of their aging parents. Adult children have also experienced more interpersonal interaction and cognitive maturity, which give them the capacity to have more consideration in conflict and to form holistic mindsets about a relationship. This implies that emotion and long-term relationships are important features in adult children's relationships with their aging parents. In this study, we consider the distinctiveness of adult children and the perspective of positive psychology for discussing the issues of parent-adult child interaction. This research uses the construct of ＂Integrating Cross-Time-and-Space Experience (ICTSE)＂ and tests its effect on the relationship between adult children and their aging parents. ICTSE is a construct that contains cognitive transformation, emotional acceptance, and relational concerns. Adult children can develop ICTSE capacity by reviewing and reframing their early parent-children interactive experiences, including recalling memories of the relationship, openness and acceptance of the current relationship, and imagination of the future relationship. Study 1 used questionnaires to explore the relationship between ICTSE and feeling of appreciation towards parents, forbearance behaviors towards parents during conflict, and deepening relationships with parents. Study 1 recruited 424 participants. Requirement of participants was above 35 years old with at least one of their parents is alive. Under 35 year-old participants were included if one of their parents above 65 years old. One hundred and forty of them completed the father version questionnaire only, 154 completed the mother version questionnaire only, and 130 completed both version questionnaires. Study 2 was an intervention program of ICTSE, incorporated with a 4-week expressive writing paradigm, which consists of recalling memories of similar life-events with parents and emotional experiences in their relationship. Participants needed to express their feeling in multiple points of view across time (meanwhile, now) and perspectives (self, parents, relationship). Forty-two adult children who were above 35 years old enrolled in the intervention program, 26 of them completed the whole program as the experimental group, and 16 of them were the control group. The results of Study 1 showed the scale of ＂Integrating Cross-Time-and-Space Experience＂ had good reliability and validity. The adult children's capacity of ICTSE positively predicted appreciation, forbearance, and relational deepening to their aging parents. Study 2 showed that the writing intervention of ICTSE promoted participants to review and reframe memories with their parents. The change score of adult children's ICTSE between pretest and posttest positively predicted the change score of appreciation, forbearance, and relational deepening to their aging parents. It shows that ICTSE capacity can be promoted in our writing program by recalling emotional memories and practicing in perspective-changing. With new understanding in relationship events, adult children can discover some unaware feelings or give a functional interpretation to past experiences and would have a more positive attitude toward their future relationship with their aging parents. These integrations of the early-life memory in the parent-child interaction closely related to their relationship makes adult children more willing to forbear their parents in conflict. The effects of ICTSE on appreciation, forbearance, and relational deepening to their aging parents were consistent within two studies, indicating that the construct of ICTSE had both theoretical and practical value.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201901-201902180004-201902180004-91-122,54,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
＂Seeing from the Scenes＂: A Psychodramatic Model for Resolving Familial Relational Conflicts in Contemporary Chinese Societies,"Yunung Lee, Nien-Hwa Lai","indigenization of counseling psychology, psychodrama, cannon of creativity, object in the scene (OIS), Bi-cultural phenomena/conflicts","This study aimed to investigate the group process and effects of a Chinese indigenous psychodramatic model titled, ＂Seeing from The Scenes; Seeing from The Person＂. This model was invented to address and resolve relational issues within families arising from the Western-Chinese bi-cultural phenomena/conflicts in contemporary Chinese societies. The bi-cultural phenomena refer to clients 'struggles between pursuing individual independence and autonomy (modernity) and maintaining relational harmony (traditionality), resulting in their attempts to seek counseling and psychotherapy. Meanwhile, the bi-cultural conflicts emerge in the counseling process from clients' contradictory needs for self-disclosure and self-affirmation (individualism-oriented) and simultaneously to save face for selves and others (collectivism-oriented). Inspired by the ＂cannon of creativity＂ in psychodramatic theory, researchers developed a ten-step working model based on psychodrama's unique perspectives on time and space. The ten steps include theme choosing and scene setting, identifying the critical object in the scene (OIS), interviewing the protagonist who reversed to the OIS, having the OIS empower the protagonist, repetitive role reversals between the protagonist and the opposite party in the troubled relationship, concretizing the sociocultural messages, mirror, enacting new strategies, consolidating the corrective experiences, imprinting the new experiences in mind through pictures or mental images. The model was implemented in nine psychodramatic groups themed around family issues. Participants were recruited from faculty members and graduate students at four academic institutes across Taipei, central China, southwest China, and north China. An expert-researcher group was formed and consisted of the director of psychodrama, the observers, and the researcher teams to identify critical interventions and turning points of each psychodrama session in order to construct preliminary group process notes using analytical procedures based on task analysis. Two semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with each protagonist first to collect their experiences during the psychodrama process, and second to understand the perceived effects of the working model on family relationships one month afterward. Two-way thematic analysis was conducted with the group process notes and interview transcripts, which then revealed four themes on therapeutic process and three themes on the therapeutic outcomes in terms of bi-cultural conflict resolutions. The study found four therapeutic mechanisms emerging from the group process: (1) the OIS facilitated self-disclosure and emotional catharsis in a face-saving way; (2) the OIS contains and empowers the protagonists while protecting their faces/public-images; (3) the OIS offered a panoramic view to the systemic contexts protagonists were embedded in; (4) the OIS served as a concrete reminder that carried the corrective experiences from therapy to real lives. As for the therapeutic effects, the study revealed three respects of transformations perceived by the protagonists in relation to their family relationships: (1) the protagonists gained awareness of the impacts of the Chinese sociocultural forces impinged on their familial relationships; (2) the protagonists accepted that the specified family members were shaped and restricted by their socio-historical and cultural contexts and thereby took initiatives to change the interactive patterns; (3) the protagonists understood the distinctive conditions/contexts that gave rise to the current relational difficulties and became able to create new possibilities in their other relationships. Based on the research findings, the current study suggested Chinese psychodramatists incorporate the ＂development-contextual perspective＂ into the ＂cannon of creativity＂ to developed a more comprehensive, systemic model for case conceptualization, assessments and interventions formation which involves the client's person, relationships, and environment. Meanwhile, the current model served as a therapeutic tool to warm-up the spontaneity and creativity within the protagonists so that they can generate deeper understandings regarding familial relationships and develop adaptive strategies in resolving interpersonal conflicts resulted from the Chinese-Western cultural/value clash/confrontation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201901-201902180004-201902180004-123-157,54,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Experience of Doubling in Psychodrama: A Phenomenological Research,"Shu-Yu You, Wei-Yun Tsai","psychodrama, doubling, hermeneutic phenomenology, Bodily feelings","This study aims at revealing the experiential structure of doubling in psychodrama using a phenomenological method. Five participants with the interpersonal issues were chosen and invited to be the protagnists. Five auxiliaries and five doubles were invited to attend the double-training workshop. In the workshop, the researcher designed a doubling scene to warm up the protagnists. The doubling scene included the protagonist, the auxiliary (who played the person and had interpersonal issue with the protagonist), and the double (who sat beside the protagonist). The director facilitated verbal dialogue between the protagonist, the auxiliary and the double. And the dialogue lasted for 30-60 minutes. The researcher collected the experience-describing of the doubles. Phenomenological analysis (Lee & Lai, 2009) was applied to the descriptions of experience. The experiential structure of doubling in psychodrama consisted of two dimensions of behaviors. One was the horizontal dimension, indicating the interpersonal verbal and nonverbal communication. The double listened to the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the protagonist and the auxiliary, listened to the interaction between the protagonist and he auxiliary. The double arouse bodily feelings and doubled for the protagonist. The other was the vertical dimension, indicating the words-bodily feelings connection. By role-playing or by interacting with the protagonist or the auxiliary, the double experienced the inner and bodily feelings, the double understood the protagonists' experience and was in the role of the double and doubled for the protagonist. There are five experiential themes in the experiential structure of doubling in psychodrama. The first experiential theme was that the double was in the role of the double by role-playing. The second experiential theme was that the double was to reveal the protagonist's inner experience. The double played the role of the protagonist, listened to the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the protagonist and the auxiliary, and listened to the interaction between the protagonist and the auxiliary. The double arouse bodily feelings and was in the role of the double, with an aim to understand protagonists' experience. The double revealed the protagonist's inner experience. The third experiential themewas that the double facilitated the protagonist's inner dialogue. The double listened to the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the protagonist and the auxiliary, and listened to the interaction between the protagonist and the auxiliary. The double arouse bodily feelings and was in the role of the double and doubled the protagonists. The double facilitated the protagonist's inner dialogue. The fourth experiential theme was that the double empowered the protagonists by bodily movement. The double listened to the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the protagonist and the auxiliary, listened to the interaction between the protagonist and the auxiliary. The double empowered the protagonists by bodily movement. The last experiential theme was that the double kept the spontaneous doubling process. The spontaneous doubling experience was that the double listened to the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the protagonist and the auxiliary. The double listened to the interaction between the protagonist and the auxiliary. The double arouse bodily feelings and keep being in the role of the double and doubled the protagonists. The double revealed the protagonist's inner experience, facilitated the protagonist's inner dialogue, and empowered the protagonists by bodily movement. The spontaneous doubling process kept going. The researcher reveals the experiential process which the double is stuck and out of stuck. The researcher revealed two situatedness of the double. One situatedness was that the double was isolated with the protagonists' experience. The other situatedness was that the double was refused by the protagonist and the auxiliary. By being doubled by the director, the double was out of stuck and keep the process of doubling. Based on the results of the study, various significant features regarding the experience of doubling in psychodrama were clarified.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201901-201902180004-201902180004-159-190,54,2019,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Inheritance and Development of Taiwan's Guidance and Counseling Profession: Review and Exploration of the Development of Local Guidance and Counseling Profession,"Hsin-Tai Lin, Chih-Hung Wang","retrospect and prospect, inheritance and integration of culture, Taiwan Guidance and Counseling Association, internationalization, Indigenization","The establishment of the Taiwan Guidance and Counseling Association is about to celebrate its 60th anniversary. The development and contribution of Taiwan's Guidance and counseling profession has reached an unprecedented height. The Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling hopes to record and celebrate this professional development. At the glorious moment, the special issue of ＂Review of Taiwan's Counseling and Counseling Professional Development＂ was planned. Through the process of invitation submit papers, the outstanding scholars in Taiwan who are working on guidance and counseling were invited to jointly write a review of Taiwan's Guidance and counseling professional development from different professional research fields. The special issue is published in the current journal based on the invited papers. This review of the special issue consists of five papers on the professional development and exploration of the topic of family therapy, spiritual counseling, narrative research, psychological displacement and ethical research. These five papers focused on the local development and reflection of Taiwan's counseling and counseling professions. They not only carefully reviewed the past developments of counseling and counseling in family therapy, spiritual counseling, narrative research, psychological displacement and ethical research. They also deeply reflect on their shortcomings, and point out the possible future development direction. The years of a Jiazi (sixty years) are suitable for retrospective and forward-looking. Under the influence of internationalization and indigenization, the special issue also delineates how the guidance and counseling professions should develop in Taiwan and what role they would play in Asia and the world.

Reflection on Culture-inclusive Concept of Bowen Theory and Practice in Chinese Culture,Yueh-Ting Lee,"family therapy, culture-inclusive, differentiation of self, Bowen's family theory","The present research examined how Bowen's family therapy theory, developed under the Western culture, could be culture-inclusive in the Chinese culture. The research introduced the philosophy and concepts of self-differentiation and anxiety in Bowen's family therapy theory. Reflecting on Bowen theory through a culture-inclusive process, this study provided three suggestions. Bowen's family therapy theory offered a different perspective in understanding family relationships in the context of the Taiwanese culture through illuminating the emotional projection processes. In addition, the researcher reviewed domestic studies conducted in relation to Bowen theory, and found that concepts of the theory could be applied to the Chinese Culture. However, some of the domestic studies suggested that the techniques of Bowen theory should be modified and cultural issues should be considered in practice. Finally, this study attempted to provide culture-inclusive suggestions toward the theory. First, the anxiety aspect in the relationship is a universal concept, but the differentiation of self is not. In Western culture, self-differentiation was based on individualism, whereas collectivism was developed in Eastern culture; these two represent different cultural norms. Thus, the practice of this family therapy approach in Chinese culture should focus on decreasing the anxiety level, and not necessary on increasing the individual's differentiation of self. Second, from the perspective, an individual's differentiation level cannot fully predict whether the relationship is healthy or unhealthy. The differentiation level serves only a reference for individual differences, and cannot be used to determine dysfunction. A person's differentiation level might not be high, but that could facilitate the fulfillment of cultural expectations and maintain a good relationship with other family members. Thus a person's differentiation level can only represent his/her own individual status, not good or bad. A Differentiation of Self Scale should be constructed that incorporates the theory of differentiation and adapts to the localized language of the Chinese culture. If possible, the definition of self-differentiation should be modified to reflect Chinese culture and some items in the scale should be edited. Furthermore, a localized norm needs to be established to illuminate the aspects of differentiation among individuals in the collectivist culture. Constructed using an individualism perspective, In addition to taking care of one's own anxiety, it is also critical to take care of the anxiety of others. In respect to the cultural importance of filial piety, taking care of the parents' emotions is an imperative aspect according to the theory of filial piety. Lastly, family therapy theories have been adopted from the Western culture for almost forty years, and there is not a single family therapy theory that has been developed in the Chinese culture so far. The author suggests that the development of family therapy theory needs to incorporate localized research as a foundation geared towards the needs of the Chinese culture. It is important have a family therapy theory that is based on Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism for our own culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201810-201812180006-201812180006-23-44,53,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Religiously/Spiritually Integrated Counseling in Taiwan - Reviews and Future Directions,"Ping-Hwa Chen, Yi-Huei Huang, Lan-Hsin Fan","Religion, religiously/spiritually integrated counseling, spirituality","Recent large scale surveys of religions in Taiwan showed over 80% of the surveyed subjects identified themselves with religious beliefs and practices, 85% of the subjects agreed religion can help people find inner peace and happiness, and ease the pains and discomforts. The 2014 American Pew Research Center's Religious and Public Life Program reported Taiwan ranked second on the Global Religious Diversity Index.These findings indicated Taiwan has a high variety of population in religion and is a multi-religious society. Western counseling literatures showed that clients with religious/spiritual backgrounds brought problems into the counseling embedding their religious/spiritual perspectives and copings towards their problems. Counselors need to inquire and understand how these clients viewed their problems religiously/spiritually so that counselors may integrate religious/spiritual interventions into counseling properly and effectively to serve clients in need. However, religiously/spiritually integrated counseling (abbreviated as r/s integrated counseling) in Taiwan is a new area and the related research is limited. The present article presents findings of reviewing the research in religiously/spiritually integrated counseling (abbreviated as r/s integrated counseling) in Taiwan in the past thirty years. Our literature review identified few r/s integrated counseling empirical studies before 2010 in Taiwan. However, after 2010, on the literature of religion/spirituality counseling has increased, and various topics on studying religion and spirituality in counseling also expanded. In the present article, the authors presented seven themes: (1)The popularity and high diversity of the religious population in Taiwan; (2) Religious/spiritual studies in psychology/counseling psychology in Taiwan, which consists of two sub-themes: the research trend of religious/spiritual studies in psychology and counseling psychology professions in Taiwan, and the research evidences support the positive function of religion/ spirituality to mental health and counseling; (3) Definitions of religion and spirituality, and r/s integrated counseling. The authors proposed the definition of r/s integrated counseling as counselors providing religiously/ spiritually integrated counseling services to clients in need, including the match of counselor's and client's religious background, and counselors exploring clients' religious and spiritual issues and employing spiritual interventions.; (4) Research findings in r/s integrated counseling practices and outcomes. Three sub-themes were organized: positive attitudes of counselors and clients toward exploring religious/spiritual issues and employing religious/spiritual interventions in counseling especially for clients with strong religious/spiritual backgrounds, various religious/spiritual interventions were employed in counseling and positive outcomes were identified by counselors and clients, and counselors' religious backgrounds and spiritual orientations influenced their personal lives and counseling works; (5)Research on r/s integrated counselor training and supervision. Three sub-themes were presented: r/s integrated counseling competencies, r/s integrated counselor training courses and outcomes, and r/s integrated counselor supervision issues and models; (6) Ethical principles of practicing r/s integrated counseling identified by counselors and clients; (7) Future directions were proposed by the authors, including promoting r/s integrated counseling through professional organizations and educational institutions, employing diversified research methodologies, integrating religion and spirituality into counseling courses and counselor continuing education classes, applying r/s integrated counseling to clients with religious and spiritual needs, , generating culturally inclusive and indigenous r/s integrated counseling theories and models, building a platform to facilitate dialogues among diverse r/s oriented and indigenous counseling professionals, and developing ethical guidelines for practicing r/s integrated counseling. The authors call attention to Taiwanese counselors/ educators/supervisors to be sensitive to the issues of religion and spirituality that clients may bring into counseling. There is a need for Taiwanese counseling profession to promote and develop the new specialty so that clients with religious/spiritual needs or issues may be better served in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201810-201812180006-201812180006-45-79,53,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Review and Prospect of Narrative Research in the Field of Psychology and Counseling in Taiwan,"Meei-Ju Lin, Chin-Chen Wen","review anad prospect, Narrative research","The purpose of this paper is three fold: (1) Review narrative studies published in psychology and counseling journals in Taiwan; (2) highlight features and significances of narrative research; and (3) discuss future research directions for improving this literature. This paper is grounded on the definition of the word of narrative, methodology of narrative research, and reviews from counseling professions. Included in this review were 67 narrative studies in journals of psychology and counseling which could be described as narrative research or using the method of narrative analysis. By the method of probing, analyzing, and interpreting, this paper presents four aspects and related research examples to illustrate significances of current narrative studies in Taiwan. (1) Narrative studies show the power of story which characterizes the dialectical relationship between personal and social construction. (2) The concept of narrative can be served as the metaphor of counseling process and changes, and can be applied to studies across counseling and psychotherapy approaches. (3) The idea of holisticcontent analysis from Lieblich, Tuval-Mashiach and Zilber was preferred and adopted in most studies, however researchers claimed that method of narrative analysis should be more diverse and complex. (4) Self-narrative studies encourage helping professionals and learners to reflect on themselves and generate their own helping knowledge, which would subsequently empower themselves and others. Although significant features were found from the review of existing narrative research, current trends of narrative studies still reveal many challenges today, especially those issues from methodology, which need to be clarified and improved. Accordingly, this paper presents five prospects for future narrative research in the field of psychology and counseling. First, from mono-tone to multiple-tone, there are diverse approaches and phenomena shown in narrative studies. Further, there is a tendency to develop toward a new paradigm of qualitative research by the refinement of cross-disciplinary study of humanities and social science. Second, with the majority of narrative research adopting the perspective of holistic-content in the analysis of narratives or stories, possible falls into the mere induction of themes would occur, and it is possible to disregard the narrative form and multi-level analysis. Moreover, there arise problems of lacking clarity in the definition and research method. And the way to work with such challenges is to return to the ＂language＂ nature of narrative. Third, there is a need for more exploration and clarification for issues such as adopted research paradigm, what is healthy narrative, and what are the criteria for good enough narrative research. Moreover, whether the focus of study is based on the perspectives of macro vs. micro, or narrative coherence vs. complexity, also need to be clarified. Forth, there is a gap between stories studied and promotion of counseling practice. In other words, with many stories collected, it is time to work on filling this gap. Finally, there has been many years in the development of narrative research in Taiwan, and many indigenous life stories and counseling stories have been accumulated. More efforts need to be invested in the convergence and connection at the level of theory construction. Conclusions of this paper are tentative, and are not the only truth. This paper invites more researchers to engage in more dialogues and exchanges their perspectives regarding narrative research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201810-201812180006-201812180006-81-116,53,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Review and Prospect of Psychological Displacement Writing Paradigm: Pronouns Characteristics and Its Beneficial Effects,Shuh-Ren Jin,"writing therapy, review and prospect, Psychological displacement, PDPD, psychological distance","Since the first research on Psychological Displacement Paradigm in Diary-writing (PDPD) was published (Jin, 2005), there have been dozens of related papers or articles published at home and abroad. The PDPD requires participants to write about their daily events specifically with negative emotions using a fixed sequence of different personal pronouns (from I to you, then to he/she). To sort out, analyze and review these published studies, the main purpose of this paper was focus on reviewing the characteristics of pronouns and the healing effects of psychological displacements, explore the possible limitations of this method, and analyze the directions and topics for further research in the future. In terms of four kinds of pronoun characteristics, the qualitative and quantitative research orientation enriched the depth and expanded nature of the pronoun characteristics as follows. (1) When writing in the ＂I＂ pronoun, people usually felt intensive emotional reactions. The characteristics of an ＂I＂ perspective include magnifying thoughts and feelings in a narrow vision, and expressing self-disclosed information via discourse model. (2) When they recounted the same life events using ＂you＂ as the subject, the contents sounded as if they were described by significant others with both self-caring and self- criticism attitudes. The ＂you＂ pronoun might rebuke the ＂I＂ occasionally as an adult disciplines a child’s misconduct. The characteristics of a ＂you＂ perspective signaled more rational with self-empathy and self-concern accordingly, and the negative emotion gradually eases. In addition, the pronoun of ＂you＂ was mainly based on the discourse model of consolation. (3) Lastly, when the same events stated using ＂s/he＂ as pronoun, the writer executed to be the most rational and least emotional. In this position, people detached themselves even further from the facts in a greatest psychological distance, and they took the widest range of perspectives as well. They told the story as if they were impartial and detached bystanders. The mentality was calm and rational, as the pronoun of ＂s/he＂ was based on the discourse model of audit. (4) When the ＂I＂ finally returned to the ＂I＂ position again, after experiencing the psychological spatial displacement, the individual could clearly apprehend the problem in the incident and also had obvious relief in a calmed emotional feeling. The pronoun of ＂back to I＂ focused on the discourse model of policymaking and consolation. In the part of impact effects from PDPD, after rotated writing by the author, the state of highly presence gradually shifted attentions from external attribution to inner self-relationship, or interpersonal relationship, and then produced significant emotional, cognitive and behavioral changes. However, this writing paradigm also encountered some negative effects or questioning on no effective. As to the reason why psychological displacement writing caused healing effects, this study founded that the effect of change in PDPD, which was the unique aspect of PDPD than other psychological distance studies, were primarily due to (1) the gradual shift and transformation of different pronouns, (2) the self-object transformation effect of ＂you＂ pronouns, and (3) the cumulative conversion effect of ＂s/he＂ pronoun, (4) the ＂back to I＂ moderation of Zhong Yong global thinking, (5) the cognitive transformation caused by the change of psychological distance, and (6) the panoramic effect of repeated writing of multiple perspectives. Finally, based on the reviewing and analyzing on the previous research of PDPD, this thesis proposed several topics and suggestions for future applications on psychological practice and empirical research as well.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201810-201812180006-201812180006-117-149,53,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
A Review Study of Counseling Ethics Research between 1986 - 2017 in Taiwan,Li-Chu Hung,"Counseling ethics, counseling ethics research, review study, school counselor, integration study","There were 51 studies on counselling ethics in Taiwan from 1986 to 2017. Descriptive statistic was used to analyze the number of research papers, research methods, research topics and development trends, and analyze the research results of each paper. The results indicate: (1) The number of counselling ethics researches in Taiwan showedan increasing trend. The number of papers in 2011-2017 accounted for 58.8% of the total number of papers. Master's and Doctoral thesis accounted for 64.7% of the total research volume. The advisor of thesis and the authors of journal focused on specific scholars. The counseling ethics research of Taiwan began with the discussion of the ethical judgment of the school counselors. However, the proportion of papers with the school counselors gradually decreased. (2) Research methods were mostly qualitative research and the numbers of quantitative studies was less than the qualitative studies. Very few studies were mixed designs. There was only one qualitative study in 1997. The number of qualitative studies in 2001-2010 is more than quantitative research. Qualitative research in 2011-2017 accounted for 73.3% of the numbers of papers in the same period. (3) Most of the studies targeted at ＂ethical cognition and ethical behavior＂, followed by the studies of ＂ethical dilemmas and coping＂ and ＂experiences in dealing with ethical issues＂, and then followed by ＂ethical thinking and decision-making＂. The studies of ＂ethical practice ＂ and ＂ethical education＂ were the least. From 1986 to 2000, research topics focused on ＂ethical cognition and ethical behavior＂. After 2001, the studies of ＂ethical dilemmas and coping＂, ＂ experiences in dealing with ethical issues ＂ and ＂ethical thinking and decision-making＂ has increased significantly. The studies of Taiwan's counseling ethics, which accounted for 33.3% of research on specific ethical issues. The remaining research topics were divided into two categories: (a) The overall discussion of the ethical cognition and ethical behavior of practitioners; (b) The ethical issues involved in some practical situation or specific form of service. (4) Analysis of the results of the researches revealed several important phenomena: (a) There were different results about ethical judgments and ethical beliefs. (b) There were inconsistencies between ethical cognition and ethical behavior. (c) Practitioners took into account multiple contexts, took into account the needs of multiple parties, and developed strategies that respond flexibly when they faced with ethical issues. (d) Practitioners reflected on the applicability and limitations of the ethical code, and paid more attention to the core spirit of professional ethics and counseling. They believed that the process of dealing with ethical issues required continuous dialogue and evaluation. Based on research results, six suggestions for the future development of Taiwan’s counseling ethics researches were proposed: (1) The research and publication of Taiwan's counseling ethics requires more researchers to invest. (2) The ethical issues and ethical practical experience faced by school counselors need to continue to pay attention. (3) Both qualitative and quantitative research have their own contributions and limitations. The research method of counseling ethics should be combined with the advantages of qualitative research and quantitative research to balance development. (4) On the research topic, more studies focused and in-depth exploring can be made on specific ethical issues involved in specific practical situations and diverse service forms. (5) The content and connotation of professional ethics education curriculum and support program needs to be expanded, taking into account the professional ethics and individual cultivation. Researchers actively develop diverse professional ethics education courses and ethical support programs, and explore their effectiveness. (6) Researchers collaborate with practitioners to conduct situational research. Researchers depict the ethical practical experience of Taiwanese practitioners in-depth and develop ethical decision and practice models with a cultural perspective.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201810-201812180006-201812180006-151-189,53,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

We try to discuss the benefits of the evidence-based practice in the counseling professional development. The learning carried out in the counseling profession could be categorized as a form of embodied knowing. In the counseling professional development of evidence-based practice, the counselors not only need to learn theoretical knowledge, but also need to learn action knowledge and embodied knowing. However, embodied knowing can often cause confusion and has to be scientifically reviewed and consolidated, and learners may also experience unclear and contradictory situations. If the spirit and principles of evidence-based practice can be adopted, the resulting application of the spirit of inquiry originating from academic research will help trainees to acquire embodied knowing that is more effective, and allow them to undergo development that emphasizes counseling approach, counseling style, and integrity. We also saw three important counseling professional competencies in the three papers included in this issue, such as the development strength of individualized counseling models, the social forces of systematic cooperation, and self-awakening growth. At the same time, in the counseling profession development, if it can be based on the ethical literacy provided by Chinese Confucianism, it can promote the development of counseling professionals to the ＂integrity＂. Finally, this paper also presents several suggestions on counseling education and training in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201808-201809250006-201809250006-1-18,52,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Strength-Centered Career Counseling and Career Calling: The Effect and Affective Experience,Yu-Chen Wang,"strength-centered career counseling, undergraduate student, Career calling","For undergraduate students who are going to experience a role transition process from student life to work life, the objective of career guidance and counseling in school is to help these students facilitate self-exploration, job discovery, and employment preparation in order to be better prepared for an unknown future of employment. Being aware of and developing career calling experience are helpful for these young adults to confront and cope with a chaotic and constantly-changing environment. The current study aimed to explore the effect of strength-centered career counseling on improving career calling experience and the affective experience of career calling. The study used a mixed-methods research design. The quantitative study explored the effect of strength-centered career calling on improving career calling experience and career self-efficacy and reducing depression of undergraduate students. The participants were 28 undergraduate students in Taiwan, 7 men and 21 women, whose average age was 21.54 (SD = 0.98). The participants were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a control group. The former received strength-centered counseling treatment and the latter took tests. Both groups completed the career calling scale for college students, career self-efficacy scale, and depression tendency scale before, immediately after, and 40 days after treatment. The collected data were analyzed via nonparametric statistics. The results indicated that the strength-centered career counseling treatment had a great effect on improving participants' overall career calling experience and career self-efficacy. The qualitative study aimed to understand the affective experience and enablers of the counseling in participants in the strength-centered career counseling treatment. The participant was a senior undergraduate student at the age of 22. The study designed an interview outline and conducted three interviews. The thematic analysis concluded that affective experience was involved with several processes including initiation, connection, and integration. Enablers were induced into two categories as attitudes and intervening factors within which were several themes. The quantitative results of this study indicated that strength-centered career counseling effectively and immediately promoted career calling experience of the participants and this finding corresponded to some previous studies. Besides, studies in the past reported that strength counseling was effective in promoting individuals' happiness and well-being. This indicates that the strength-centered counseling may be significantly more effective in the influence on implicit, spiritual, and meaning dimensions in life of individuals. The value of the current study is to confirm that the strength-centered career counseling treatment had an effect on improving undergraduate students' career calling experience and their career self-efficacy. Hence, we put forward some suggestions for the practice of strength-centered counseling that: (1) The core target of strength-centered counseling is to help individuals integrate and balance all self aspects and apply which to promote inner, spiritual, and meaning dimensions in life. We suggest promoting and integrating strength counseling with other counseling approaches for enhanced effectiveness. (2) We suggest helping individuals to explore their core or signature strengths and link which to different life dimensions and to different selves. This process requires more exploration processes via dialogues to identify and magnify individuals' strengths in more depth. (3) Career calling experience can be fostered through counseling intervention. In addition to administering strength-centered career counseling treatment, we propose that school courses or group guidance that are related to career exploration may adopt a series of questioning techniques to assist individuals in raising the awareness of career calling experience. Also, from this study we can learn that strength-centered career counseling treatment may significantly improving career calling experience of individuals. We suggest that in future, practitioners may apply strength-centered career counseling treatment to the groups with different backgrounds as well as try to undersand its following effectiveness in them.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201808-201809250006-201809250006-19-50,52,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"LGBT Issues and Counseling Competency: The Impact of Training on Enhancing Knowledge, Awareness and Skills","Hsiao-Pei Chang, Yi-Jung Lee","LGBT issues, Counseling competency, training program","Research showed that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals have a higher prevalence rate of mental disorders than heterosexuals. Mental health is related to different factors, such as race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, etc. Stressors that are unique to LGBT individuals, such as homophobia, stigma, prejudice, discrimination and hate crimes, create a hostile environment for LGBT individuals. According to literature, a stressful social environment is related to higher risk of mental disorders, substance abuse, and suicidal behaviors. For LGBT adolescents, it is rather common to experience bully in school, which has a negative impact on their mental health. Moreover, their functioning level related to life and school usually decline, such as lower academic achievement, dropping out of school, etc. Research indicated that being bully during adolescence is related to depression, suicide ideation, lower life satisfaction, and lower self-esteem in adult life. Being rejected by others is also related to fear of establishing close relationships, lack of positive outlook of life, difficulty of expressing emotions, etc. For LGBT adults, they often need to deal with differential treatment in the work environment. For example, transgender individuals' income is usually lower than non-transgender individuals. Those unique stressors related to LGBT individuals indicate that they are in great need of professional help. However, it is rather difficult for LGBT individuals to find satisfying mental health services, which reflects the lack of appropriate and effective training in the counseling graduate programs. This study aimed at designing and developing a training program for counseling graduate students to enhance their multicultural counseling competency to serve LGBT clients, and exploring their experience in the training program. Participants were recruited from counseling-related graduate programs. Participants included 40 graduate students from counseling-related programs. The training program was designed based on the framework of multicultural counseling competence (i.e., knowledge, attitude, and skills), cognitive developmental theory, relevant literature, and discussions with professionals of LGBT issues. Participants received 40 hours of training related to LGBT issues which included six themes. The training themes were self-identification development process, interpersonal and romantic relationships, ＂coming out of the closet＂ and family relations, career development process, stigma, and systematic collaboration. Each theme was taught by a different lecturer, who was selected based on their expertise. This was to make sure that the training program covered three areas of multicultural counseling competence (i.e., knowledge, attitude, and skills). The impact of the training program was evaluated by focus group interviews and the content analysis. The results showed that this training program had positive impact on participants' competence to serve LGBT clients. The results indicated changes in three areas: knowledge, attitudes and skills. Participants reported more in-depth knowledge related to LGBT issues. They stated that they became more aware of their own explicit and implicit biases toward LGBT issues. They started to show changes of attitude, such as becoming more open-minded, flexible, and courageous in terms of advocating for LGBT individuals. Participants indicated enhancement of their skills, such as active listing, empathy, information providing, systematic collaboration, utilization of different media in counseling, etc. The results also showed that multiple formats of discussions, perspective-taking, experiential activities and learning LGBT individuals' personal experience were the key factors related to effective learning. The results have import implications for training and promoting LGBT counseling competence. It is suggested that deconstructing cultural encapsulation, contextual factors, and reflective learning are important elements. Students need to be aware of their own stereotypes of LGBT individuals and issues in order to deconstruct their habitual way of thinking. The training also needs to take students' background and learning level into consideration. It seems to be more effective to utilize reflective learning method to help students develop and enhance their multicultural counseling competence. Those three elements are essential for educators to design and advocate for LGBT counseling competence training program in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201808-201809250006-201809250006-51-80,52,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
An Action Research on Ecological System Approach Guidance Activities Applying to Rebuild Class Friendly Atmosphere,Shu-Chun Lin,"anti-bully, class guidance activities, Action research, class positive/friendly atmosphere, ecological system approach","The study adopted action research to treat bully problems in junior high school classes. The purpose of this study was to explore a school counselor or counseling psychologist how to deal with students' bully problems, by ecological system approach guidance activities. ＂Ecological approach guidance activities＂ meant to evaluate and understand students' needs and problems before intervention, then design guidance activities to meet students' needs and solve their problems. The ecological system approach guidance activities emphasized evaluating and understanding the class and students' interaction dynamic, instead of treating one or few of the students as a ＂problem student＂ or ＂trouble maker＂. After understanding the class dynamic, the next step was adopting ecological system approach intervention strategies, and facilitating the teacher/mentor to collaborate with the school counselor. In simple terms, the school counselor had to evaluate class dynamic at first, then drew up intervention strategies, carried out the intervention, and assessed the outcome after implementing. There were three data resources evaluating class dynamic: (1) discussed with the teacher or mentor, (2) observed the group interaction, and (3) interviewed students. To resolve bully problems in class, anti-bully activities could only treat the symptoms but not the root cause. The most important was rebuilding school or class positive and friendly atmosphere, and enhancing group cohesion. The action research process had five stages: (1) Before action: evaluated students' and group's specific needs and problems. This was a 7th grade class, in the beginning of the first semester, the students often treated others in a mean way, for example: to irritate each other, describe others in a negative way, supplant some disadvantaged students, threaten, rumor, and physical aggression, etc. In this situation, if the school counselor discussed anti-bully directly, the adolescents may feel be blamed, and arouse their defense. The students needed to learn how to treat others friendly, not only be requested to stop improper behavior, and the class had to rebuild positive and friendly atmosphere, and support students' proper interpersonal behavior. (2) The first action: adopted encouraging altruistic behavior strategy to solve students' and group's problems. In this stage, the researcher invited the class mentor as a partner to carry out the guidance activities together, and applied encouraging system to inspire students' altruistic behavior. The strategy transferred the negative focus (students' improper behavior) to positive focus (altruistic behavior). (3) After the first action: evaluation and feedback - to think back over the encouraging system, and revise the action. Encouraging students' altruistic behavior was effective. But it seemed to occur together with a secret concern: students' altruistic behavior was from internal? Or just for reward? If we take the reward away, the students would continue their altruistic behavior? To solve the concern, the researcher developed the next action. (4) The second action: applying a picture book and series activities to rebuild class positive and friendly atmosphere, and enhance their cohesion. The action implemented in another year, a new 7th grade class which also had bully behavior. The researcher invited the class mentor for cooperation to resolve the problem. There were series guidance activities, including: (a) Line game: helped students finding their common ground, (b) read the picture book ＂The Original Warm Fuzzy Tale＂, (c) discussed and created class ＂warm fuzzy＂ environment. (5) After the second action: evaluation and feedback. The action research found the strategy improving group's positive and friendly interaction effectively. This intervention matched WISER model which based on ecological system approach: primary and developmental guidance activities not only prevent problems, but also resolve the occurred problems.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201808-201809250006-201809250006-81-112,52,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Spirituality and Living with One's Spirit: From Four Big Questions of Human Existence to Construct Indigenous Theories for Spirituality and Career,"Yung-Jong Shiah, Shu-Hui Liu, Chih-Hung Wang, Sung-Hsien Sun","Career, self-enlightenment, spirituality, Confucianism/Buddhism/Taoism, indigenous counseling psychology","No matter where you live and what cultures you belong to. You may encountered four big questions of human existence. Where do I come from? Why I am in this life situation? Why do I suffer? How do I find salvation? The current issue focuses on spirituality and career along with six accepted papers to echo for these four big questions of human existence. We combined previous research and the six accepted papers to provide the conclusion as follows: (1) The spiritual growth leads to overcome the pain. No matter what religions you belong to or not. Spiritual learning and exploring spiritual issues during counseling would help to overcome suffering and gain spiritual growth. (2) The religions provide worldviews and career views. The western monotheism stresses on the connection or close to the God leading to the individualistic worldview. The cultures of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism aim at the cultivating self-enlightenment process to transform the self or one's spirit to the good, nonself and authentic self. The self-enlightenment process leads to self-cultivation and the harmony worldview. There are emerging counseling studies and models to utilize the ideas of Buddhism. For example, the mindfulness originated from the Buddhism have been supported its benefits by many empirical studies. The study of the Karma Belief Scale development in our current issue could be used to assess the karma belief among the Buddhist and Taoism believers, with an aim to reveal another possible perspective to enhance mental and body health, and life adjustment. (3) We live in spiritual ways. One needs to make his or her career choice, select spiritual beliefs to apply them in the life world and understand one's life situation to live with one's spirit. Choosing to live with one's spirit between life beliefs and goals is a repeated spiral and transforming process. Obtaining necessary abilities to live one's own script in the life word could be enhanced by certain training models. Accordingly, we provide following suggestion for future research. (1) Based on the current spiritual and counseling empirical studies, we could develop related theories. (2) To open more dialogues and connection between career and spirituality could develop related theories linking spirituality to career. Then spirituality and career could be complementary to develop a helping professionalism with a more holistic development. (3) That the development of self-enlightenment models derived from the wisdom of Chinese cultures of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism is the core to construct indigenous theories for spirituality and career. The wisdom of Chinese cultures of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism could be the sources for the cultural consciousness program of Taiwan counseling professionalism. During the developing process of indigenous counseling and indigenous counseling psychology, it is worth to combine Modern western counseling theories and our cultural heritage with local living experiences. The article urges that we could draw on the Professor Kwan-Kuo Hwang's multiple philosophical paradigms to analyze Chinese cultures of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism as the basis to construct indigenous theories for spirituality and career. Accordingly, the indigenous theories for spirituality and career employing the Chinese cultures will be transformed to microworlds of scientific knowledge. Two analyzed examples of self-enlightenment models based on the Chinese cultures are presented. Specifically, the Buddhist self-enlightenment model suggests that we apply the self-cultivation principle by obeying certain precepts, practicing compassion, and absorbing wisdom. The aim of all this is to see through and overcome the delusion of the self, transforming self to nonself. The nonself state is authentic and durable happiness. Finally, we are calling for Chinese scholars to cultivate themselves towards to self-enlightenment then to comfort the others and construct new and modern Chinese indigenous counseling psychology based on merging our cultural roots and the western scientific knowledge, along with ongoing communications and dialogues with the Western academic societies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201804-201805100008-201805100008-1-26,51,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
When Spirituality Meets Counseling: The Clients' Experiences,"Ping-Hwa Chen, Lan-Hsin Fan, Mei-Chuan Chu","Clients' experiences, spiritually integrated counseling","Recent large scale surveys of religions in Taiwan showed over 80% of the surveyed subjects identified themselves with religious beliefs, 85% of the subjects agreed religion can help people find inner peace and happiness, and ease the pains and discomforts. 2014 American Pew Research Center's Religious and Public Life Program reported Taiwan ranked second on the Global Religious Diversity Index. All the data indicated Taiwan has a high population in religion and is a multi-religious society. Western counseling researches and literatures showed that clients with religious/spiritual backgrounds brought problems into the counseling embedding their religious/spiritual perspectives and copings towards their problems. Counselors need to inquire and understand how these clients viewed their problems spiritually so that they could integrate religious/spiritual interventions into counseling to serve religious/spiritual clients more effectively. However, such research is rare in Taiwan, there is a need to conduct researches to call Taiwanese' counselors attentions to the topic. The purpose of the present study was to explore the experiences of clients who had received counseling incorporating religion/spirituality. The research questions included to explore the clients' expectations and attitudes towards receiving spiritually integrated counseling, the religious/spiritual issues raised and the religious/spiritual interventions received in the counseling sessions, and the reported counseling outcomes. Ten research participants with different religious/spiritual backgrounds and having experiences of receiving spiritually integrated counseling were recruited and participated in the study. Among them, three ware Christians, three were Buddhists, two identified themselves with having multiple religion/spiritual backgrounds, and two identified themselves with no specific region/spiritual backgrounds. Among the ten, one was male and nine were females. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted for data collection. Interviewed questions included the religious/spiritual identities the interviewees were holding, the spiritually integrated counseling experiences received, the expectations towards the counselors' religious/spiritual backgrounds and the counselors' integrated counseling approaches, the religious/spiritual issues raised in the counseling sessions, the counselors' responses and the religious/spiritual interventions used in the counseling, and the resulting counseling outcomes. Thematic analysis was employed for data analysis. Seven themes were identified as the research finding. These seven themes were: clients with religious/spiritual backgrounds had motives, expectations, and concerns of receiving spiritually incorporated counseling, multiple religious/spiritual and psychological issues were intertwined and presented in the counseling sessions, clients received various religious/spiritual interventions from the counselors in the counseling sessions, facilitating and hindering factors which influenced the clients and /or the counselors to initiate and continue the religious/spiritual topics were identified, spiritually integrated counseling resulted in clients' spiritual and psychological growth, most clients showed positive attitudes of receiving spiritually integrated counseling, and clients claimed the ethical principles of practicing the spiritually integrated counseling. The discussions were focused on five points: 1. It is important to explore the specific expectations and concerns of clients with religious/spiritual backgrounds. Clients hold specific expectations on counselors' religious/spiritual backgrounds, integrating religious/spiritual interventions in counseling, and counselors' openness towards their personal religious/spiritual experiences. 2. Highly religious/spiritual devoted clients expect counselors to help them understand their encountered personal or interpersonal problems with both psychological and religious/spiritual perspectives. 3 Taiwan is a multi-religious society, and clients may come from various religious/spiritual backgrounds. Counselors can better serve clients with religious/spiritual needs if they are equipped with various religious/spiritual traditions and interventions. 4 Both common and religious/spiritual specific factors identified which facilitate and hinder the initiation and continuation of the religious/spiritual topics between the interaction of counselors and clients. Common facilitating factors relate to the trusting and supporting relationship the counselors created, and clients' readiness to change, openness to self-disclosure. Common hindering factors relate to clients' high anxiety of disclosing self, counselors' passivity, lack of direction, structure and counseling plans. Specific facilitating factors relate to counselors' acceptance of clients' religious beliefs, counselors' competencies in facilitating religious/spiritual conversations, and clients' recognition of the religious/spiritual interventions used. Specific hindering factors relate to clients' un-comprehension to the religious/spiritual interventions used, counselors are unable to provide religious/spiritual interventions clients needed, and counselors avoid religious/spiritual topics. 5. Religious/spiritual clients' counseling experiences and outcomes are positive when counselors integrate spirituality into counseling. However, counselors should not impetuously impose religious/spiritual interventions to those clients without religious/spiritual interests or backgrounds. Two suggestions were proposed in the end. Firstly, the result highlights the necessity of integrating religion/spirituality into counselors' practices. Thus, students and counselors need to acquire the competencies of practicing spiritually integrated counseling through counselor education courses, supervisions, and continuing education. Secondly, future researches on counselors' attitudes and perceived competencies of practicing spiritually integrated counseling, the positive and negative experiences of clients' receiving spiritually integrated counseling, and the effectiveness of practicing spiritually integrated counseling interventions are all needed for enhancing the knowledge of this new area of spiritually integrated counseling.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201804-201805100008-201805100008-27-65,51,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Impact of Mindfulness in School at Taiwan: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Jing-Hua Chen, Min-Ning Yu","mindfulness, Meta-analysis, Taiwan","In recent years, researches on mindfulness in Europe and the United States have been booming. Mindfulness is generally used in a variety of fields, such as medicine, psychotherapy, health care, business and education. Mindfulness in schools is also becoming more and more popular. Mindfulness, perceived in a particular way, is purposeful awareness in the present moment and being nonjudgmental. Research shows that mindfulness can not only reduce anxiety and depression, but also promote concentration, emotional management and human relationships. Mindfulness promotes happiness and self-compassion. Mindfulness has its effects in cognitive performance, interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence and stress management. The aim of this paper is tantamount to understand the impact of mindfulness in the school at Taiwan. The systematic review and meta-analysis used data from thesis, dissertations, and peer review journals from 1991 to 2016 as inputs in understanding the impact of mindfulness in the school at Taiwan. Twenty-six studies were identified. In total, 2279 students were instructed in mindfulness, with 1250 serving as control group and 1029 as treated group, ranging from kindergartens to colleges. A meta-analysis is applied as the research method in order to understand the differences between the experimental group and the control group and to examine the overall effect and heterogeneity. According to the results of heterogeneity test, the effect model was selected and the moderators were concerned, such as the age of participants, the duration of mindfulness intervention and the category of mindfulness effect. This study utilized CMA (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis) statistical analysis software for meta-analysis. CMA proposed publication error verification. The study of failed-safe N = 11.38905 (p = .000), reaching a significant level of .001, indicating no publication bias. The results revealed that overall effect sizes were medium and positive. Among groups for domains were stress management, cognitive performance, emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills, which effect sizes were all positive. The mindfulness intervention time within 1-8 weeks was the best, and the effect of mindfulness was no significant differences in ages. Overall, the benefits of mindfulness in schools were positive. Finally, according to the research findings, practical suggestions for educational policy-making and researches were proposed. In educational practice, school authorities can systematically arrange various mindfulness training courses based on the needs of students and faculty members, including: (1) mindfulness and empowering courses for teachers, (2) academic achievement mindfulness courses, (3) emotion management mindfulness courses, (4) mindfulness-based stress reduction courses, (5) mindfulness general elective courses. In research limitations and future research, according to the conclusions of this study, the effect of mindfulness training has its effect in cognitive performance, stress management, emotional management and interpersonal skills. However, the diversity of study samples, vary in implementation and training, and a wide range of instruments and differentiated examination of data were difficult to be identified, too. There was great heterogeneity. Many studies were underpowered, and measuring effects of mindfulness in this setting was challenging. Based on this study, mindfulness training implemented in each research paper has its own different approach. Therefore, if future studies can explore the effects of mindfulness produced by different mindfulness training, so that participants can join in different mindfulness training according to their needs. Furthermore, for the prediction of the effects of mindfulness, there should be more precise theoretical basis for understanding and explaining the psychological mechanism of mindfulness, such as when and why the impacts of mindfulness happen. Through this study, it may also enrich the theory of psychology, and, in addition, the development of mindfulness measurement tools, so that it can lead to a more correct measurement of the mindfulness. According to different purposes of mindfulness to seek the appropriate mindfulness scale, the research will come to a better result.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201804-201805100008-201805100008-67-103,51,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
From Suspicion to Trust: the Middle-aged and Older Adult Religious Believers' Spiritual Learning Process,"Chun-Ting Yeh, Ya-Hui Lee","religion, Adult learning, spiritual learning, experiential learning","In previous studies and literature on both spiritual learning and experiential learning, we found that individual learning is a learning process utilizing past and prior experiences on future practices, namely, from the past to the future. Both literature and previous research paid much attention on individual learning in terms of how learners interact and gain experiences from the external world, self-life experiences, and reflections. From the study of spiritual issues, spiritual health is one of the factors of successful aging, as well as the positive significance of religion and spirituality, but it is difficult to fully understand the entire experience process of personal spiritual learning. However, the theory of experiential learning can be very helpful to further explore the spiritual learning process since the theory of experiential learning emphasizes the goal consciousness, action, reflection, feeling and experience of learning process. These concepts have already contributed to the current research to further explore the evolution process of personal spiritual value from a very simple perspective to a more advanced scope. For instance, we learned that individuals need to achieve the spiritual health status through the integration of life experience, covering the past to the future growing process. Having a lack of related research on how individuals succeed spiritual health, the current research aimed to investigate the middle-aged and older adults' spiritual learning process. In order to explore and analysis participants' spiritual learning experiences, we adopted phenomenology approach and conducted semi-structured interviews with 6 middle-aged and older adults. These participants were 3 males and 3 females, the ages ranged from 49~67 and average age 58.2 years. The participants were 1 Christian, 1 Catholic, 1 Muslim, and 3 Buddhists, respectively. The results of the study were summarized as followings: The participants' spiritual learning experiences could be divided into four phases, including initial contact, doubt and conflict, learning reflections, and experienced spiritual meaning. The first phase explained and referred to the reason why middle-aged and older adults first contact certain religions and the inner feelings of participating in religious beliefs. The second phase illustrated how adults' inner doubts and conflicts aroused from their learning processes which mainly involved ignorance of the truth of religious explanations, suspicion and misunderstanding of religious doctrines, conflicts with family members due to religious problems, or interruption of religious activities. The third phase referred to a more specific study and reflection on religion and spirituality, including the guidance of the elegant, the study of a group, the combination of experience, fixed time and step-by-step learning, and further reflection on personal work, sin, interpersonal and failure experience. The fourth phase referred to the participants' sense of spiritual learning from their religious beliefs. The first two phases were the spiritual learning that took place in the early stages. The first two phases can be discovered in their spiritual learning processes at a very initial stage. In the study, we found that participants are commonly curious about religion or resolve their questions after encountering negative experiences. All these can facilitate their demands of perusing a higher level of spirituality. Furthermore, there were continuous flow between the last two phases of spiritual learning. As participants felt spiritual through continuous learning, they continued to devote themselves to religious activities and learning and experienced the value of spirituality again from the reflection of self, life, and negative experiences. Spiritual learning experiences mainly occurred in the phase of learning reflections and experienced spiritual meaning as these two phases were usually for participants who have more time to further study and engage the study of religious spirituality after they retired from their work. By doing so, they learned and understood the meaning of religious spirituality from their young to old life experiences. In the spiritual learning process, the participants were affected by the inner peace, possessed the inner strength to overcome the dilemma and the spiritual bath, understood the meanings of life, and took actions to change the life, to contribute, as well as to make efforts for next life. These benefits from spiritual learning helped the participants lead a healthy and active life.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201804-201805100008-201805100008-105-141,51,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Hermeneutics Analysis of Life Goals Change within Narrative Therapy Process and Narrative Structure Feature,Su-Fei Huang,"narrative structure, Hermeneutic analysis, life goal, narrative counseling","The life goal in everyday life can be used both as an alleged word or a subjective word. If life goal use as an alleged word, it is a communication tool for people to refer their relationship with social life. People in social activities use it as a tool function. If life goals use as a subjective word, life goal has left from social life field and enter into the subjective context or episodic memory field, life goal become a description of the person's life world. Life goal turned to be a subjective meaning space. Life goal is treated within personal meaning context in which it is as a manifested. According to the research title, purpose and research methods, literature review lists to discuss four themes: First, life goals as alleged word; Second, life goals as the subjective word; Third, the nature of the narrative psychotherapy; Fourth, narrative therapy work map and narrative structure. The text for research is based on 25 counseling sessions within 18 months by narrative psychotherapy method. In this research try to integrate therapy process and experience by case study, and systematically explore life goal change and narrative elements in therapy process. There are four research purposes: First, is to understand how the social and cultural context shapes life goals. Second, is explored life goal setting as chief complaint in therapy, how are the narrative perspective changed. Third, to clarify the life goals change in narrative therapy process how is the narrative structure emerged. Fourth, is to engage text interpretation and how the knowledge be produced. Phenomenological approach was applied as analyze method which is according to Moustakas' modified van Kaam method for analysis (Moustakas, 1994). This hermeneutic analysis method includes seven steps: 1. description of experience: listing and preliminary grouping, 2. horizonalization: reduction and elimination, 3. meaning units: clustering and thematizing the invariant constituents, 4. thematizing: final identification of the invariant constituents and themes by application, 5. individual textual description: construct for each co-researcher an individual textual description, 6. individual structural descriptionconstruct: construct for each co-researcher an individual structural description, and 7. textural-structural description: construct for research participant a textural-structural description of the meanings and essences of the experience. Six findings will be addressed below. First, depicting the characteristics of the world that made her live ＂without herself＂. Second, by de-construct the dominate stories to reveal alternative stories and ＂away from＂ constructed life goal. Third, clarify co-authoring and stories reconstruction process. Fourth, to explore how narrative frames transform that would emerge subjectivity life-goal. Fifth, sorting out the change features of life goal in narrative structure, which include: 1. Be-constructed narrative: the restricted narrative structure features; 2. De-constructive narrative: the release narrative structure feature; 3. Re-constructive narrative: the rewriting narrative structure feature; 4. Life goal is generate within ＂previous experience＂ and ＂continued options＂ which consist a narrative spiral. Sixth, proposed the mental circulation space model and the transform features of narrative structure. The first research purpose is to understand how social and cultural context shape life goals which could be answer by first & second results. The second research purpose is to exploring narrative frame transform that was based on narrative counseling by life goal as chief complain which could be answer by third & fourth results. The third research purpose is to explore narrative structure features changing in narrative counseling for life goals which could be answer by fifth result. The Fourth research purpose is to clarify narrative text analysis and knowledge production which could be answer by sixth results. The contribution of this study is found that the narrative structure of narrative therapy contain with three elements: 1. Beconstructed Narrative Structure- restricted state.

A Study on the Construction and Development of Karma Belief Scale for Undergraduate in Taiwan,Ming-Chang Tsai,"school counselling, karma belief scale, life education, undergraduate, Karma belief","Karma belief is the critical view point of Taiwanese in the situation of ethical decision and suffering. For life education and school counselling, karma belief has the important implications. However, there is neither measurement of karma belief that base on the culture, nor systematic examination in karma belief of Taiwanese. Base on above, the main purpose of this present study was to construct the contents of karma belief, develop a measurement of karma belief for college students in Taiwan, investigate the karma belief of native undergraduate, and understand the profile of karma belief of undergraduate in Taiwan. In order to reach the purpose, the researcher used the methods of literature discussion, interview and survey, constructed the contents of karma belief by the examination of traditional culture and interview, selected undergraduate to be the empirical research subjects. The formal Karma Belief Scale (KBS) consists of 28 items, and divided into seven dimensions. Subjects were sampled by the way of stratified multi-stage sampling. A sample of 1158 college students was recruited to finish the Karma Belief Scale. In order to examine the reliability of Karma Belief Scale, the way of test-retest reliability and Cronbach's alpha reliability were used. The Exploratory factor analysis and Confirmatory factor analysis was calculated to check the validity of Karma Belief Scale. The result of this study showed the reliability and validity of Karma Belief Scale was generally well. The undergraduate in Taiwan to tend to believe the beliefs of 'retribution in this life', 'afterlife retribution', 'retribution in descendant' and 'create destiny'. However, the undergraduate in Taiwan have the tendency of rejecting the beliefs of 'offset of good and evil', 'religious redemption' and 'accept destiny'. The relationship between religious faith and karma belief was significant. The students who without any religious faith had the less beliefs in all dimension of Karma Belief Scale. The Christian students had lower score in the dimension of 'retribution in descendant', 'offset of good and evil', 'accept destiny' and 'create destiny' than the students who had the religious faith of Buddhism, Taoism, I-Kuan Tao and Folk belief. The difference of karma belief between male and female undergraduate in Taiwan was significant. The female undergraduate had higher acceptation in the dimension of 'retribution in this life', 'afterlife retribution', 'retribution in descendant' and 'create destiny' than male undergraduate. The male had lower acceptation in the dimension of 'offset of good and evil', 'religious redemption'. Finally, this present study discussed how to apply the result of this study to life education and school counseling. The karma belief has both advantages and disadvantages in the practice of life education and school counseling. In life education, the karma belief could be used to be the one of criteria in situation of ethical decision and in answer the question of 'Why should become a moral person?' However, belief of karma may let students looking forward the external remuneration then could not to be autonomous, and lack the moral courage to criticize the violation. In school counseling, when people encounter the impermanence of life, they need a reasonable attribution instead of relief of suffering. So the karma belief could be the comfort when student in suffering, but the disadvantage of karma belief may just like the Karl Manx's ridicule to religion, is the opium of the people, could let them hold the negative view of fatalism, don't want work hard to deal with difficult, even the difficult is not really serious.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201804-201805100008-201805100008-181-216,51,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Perspectives of Novice School Counselors in Taiwan Elementary and Secondary Schools for Pre-service Training Programs,"Yu-Hsien Sung, Pei-San Lee, Sheng-Chieh Chang","novice school counselors, Needs assessment, pre-service training programs, satisfaction","After Taiwan's Ministry of Education enacted ＂Student Guidance and Counseling Act＂ in 2014, thousands of novice school counselors are recruited to provide counseling services in elementary schools and secondary schools. Based on this act, school authorities must also arrange at least 40 hours pre-service basic professional training programs for novice school counselors to enhance their professional counseling capacity and even to help them realize the job descriptions of school guidance work in advance. However, there are no any empirical studies regarding this pre-service basic professional training programs until now. Some studies indicate that if the effectiveness and quality of professional training programs want to be improved, the perspectives and opinions of the participants for the professional training programs need to be explored. Therefore, to explore the effectiveness of the training programs and to provide constructive suggestions for the further training programs, this study recruits the main participants of the training programs - 113 novice school counselors to participate in the quantitative survey and the qualitative interview. The purpose of this study is to explore satisfactions, needs, and participating experiences of these novice school counselors for the training programs based on the reaction level of Four Level Evaluation Model (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2006). The data is collected by self-report questionnaire and semi-structured interview, and then these collected data is analyzed by Rasch PCM Model, good-of-fit test, and constant analysis. The results indicate that these novice school counselors feel dissatisfied with some aspects of the training programs which do not meet their needs. For instances, they feel dissatisfied with the time planning of the training programs, topics of courses among the training programs, teaching methods of courses among the training programs, and so on. As a result, their expectation for this training programs are as below. First, they expect that these courses among the training programs should be divided into compulsory courses and elective courses according to different positions of participants, and this categorization not only can assist the novice school counselors to establish their common professional capability but also assist them to establish the professional capability according to their different positions. Second, they expect that the organizer needs to survey the participants' training needy and then plans the training programs. Third, they think that the best period to hold the training program is summer vacation. Fourth, they think that, in order to enhance the effectiveness of the training program, the organizer needs to adopt some appropriate teaching methods for these novice school counselors, such as case method, practical discussion, and so on. Fifth, they expect that the organizer should establish evaluation mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of the courses among the training program. Although the above-mentioned expectations are deserved consideration, overall, these novice school counselors still agree with the values of the training programs. For instances, they agree that the training programs can assist them to understand the work contents of school counseling, to clarify their role definition, and to prepare well basic professional skills for school counseling, thereby enhancing their professional identification and building their professional images. In addition, this study also proposes the two-track training and blended learning models for promoting novice school counselors' qualities and abilities. Most importantly, this study reorganizes the course structures of the training programs. Based on the results of this study, it is expected that the effectiveness and appropriateness of the training programs can be improved to support the development of professional capability of novice school counselors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201804-201805100008-201805100008-217-262,51,2018,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

However, people's attitudes and ways to deal with the crisis may vary from person to person and from cultural backgrounds. How do we to turn the crisis into a chance? One of the key factors is resilience. This article aims at the issue of cultural context and resilience, which are all involved in the five essays in this volume as the theme of this article. First of all, we take the issue of cultural context as the starting point of this article. Then we review the research and the development of theory on resilience. This article echoes the construction of the positive psychology concept. It has undergone four wave studies such as factors, process, operation mechanism and multiple analysis levels of theoretical development since 1982. Based on this review, five essays in this volume focus on the discussion of resilience-related issues. The five essays included in this volume of journal mainly focus on the first wave of positive psychology. A few essays involve the operation of the third and fourth waves of positive psychology. In addition to appealing to future researchers to adopt the second wave of positive psychology, this article calls for citing references to the development of the second wave of positive psychology discussed in the previous volume of our journal, drawing on the point of view of contextual variable, Chinese dialectical thinking and duality, as the fifth wave acting as the development guidelines. This article puts forward the indigenous counseling psychology research of resilience with the perspective of contextual variables, with an aim to bring the direction, goal and strategy of indigenous counseling psychology and indigenization of counseling research. The directions of indigenous counseling psychology research are: (1) To review the history: The researchers need to review the past history from the perspective of counseling psychology to carry out the historical research of counseling psychology; (2) To confirm the theme: The researchers are suggested to not only focus on innovative research topics of indigenous culture characteristics, but also consider the comparison and docking with the previous counseling psychology research topics; (3)To establish the method: The researches are suggested to not only use the existing research methods, but also new methods based on cultural relevance and innovation research topics, for the indigenous counseling psychology studies, being local or global. The goals of indigenous counseling psychology research are: (1) The introduction of foreign theory (localization): The foreign counseling theory would be more applicable to the local people through the amending process based on the local culture.; (2) The indigenization of cultural integration (acculturative indigenization): Western counseling theories and techniques can be integrated with the cultural tradition and the living experience of the East, and finally transformed to new counseling theories; (3) The indigenization of cultural inheritance (enculturative indigenization): Based on the local culture and experience, we could create new original counseling theories and techniques. The new original counseling theories will be more applicable to the local people and will also demonstrate different counseling approaches to the Western counseling professionals. The strategies of indigenous counseling psychology research are: (1) Concept exploration: It is suggested to combine use of Eastern traditional wisdom as the theme, and adopt the Western philosophy of science as the basis to have clever choices of appropriate cultural content and research methods for indigenous counseling psychological research; (2) Theory construction: The construction of counseling theory could represent both the universal mind and the local cultural mentality; (3) Research validation: The researchers are encouraged to conduct research to support the new theory of indigenous counseling psychology, with an view to demonstrating its academic and practical application value. Finally, the current volume of our journal calls for new development of indigenous counseling psychology and Chinese counseling profession.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201712-201801180005-201801180005-1-28,50,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Examining protective and resources factors for depression among junior high school students experiencing different levels of family risk,Hsing-Jung Chen,"communication with support, sport, school attachment, comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric problems, Art","Severe depression will decrease young people's social functioning and increase their suicidal behaviors. This is especially true for those who have a parent with an alcohol problem or comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric problems. Interventions incorporating a risk-reducing approach may not effectively help children of a parent with an alcohol problem or comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric problems because risks related to alcohol problems such as genetics, mental illness, and chronic life stress are not easy to manage, minimize, or eliminate. Therefore, the knowledge of positive factors of influence is crucial for the advanced development of intervention programs. Unfortunately, although a great number of studies have identified risks related to alcohol problems, only a few studies have focused on positive factors. Few studies clarify which factors have a positive influence across different family risk levels. It is unclear whether the positive factors derived from the research on youths in low-risk families can be effective on youths who have a parent with an alcohol problem or comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric problems. Based on the resilience perspective, the aim of this research is to investigate what kinds of positive factors can predict depression among junior high school students who come from families with different risk levels. The resource factors are defined as factors that can predict depression for youths experiencing high- and low-risk levels, whereas protective factors are defined as factors that can predict depression for youths experiencing high-risk levels (i.e. having a parent with an alcohol problem or comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric problems). The junior high school students' data derived from the Taiwan Education Panel Survey (n=15,999) and the Stata 13.0 statistical software were used for this study. Descriptive statistics for sample characteristics, correlations for variable relationships, cronbach's alpha for internal reliability, power analysis for detecting effect sizes as well as intra-class correlation analysis for examining the issues of the nested effect were performed before multiple regression analyses. Seven main predictors, along with three control variables (i.e. the first wave of depression, gender, and family financial status), were included in regression models that presented the low-risk family, the family of a parent with an alcohol problem, and the family with comorbidity of alcohol and psychiatric problems. The research has four major findings. (1) Most predictors predict the depression for youths from low-risk families only. (2) Positive individual characteristics, family communication with support, positive reinforcement parenting, school attachment, and sports engagement were negatively associated with depression among low-risk youths. Among those factors, school attachment (B = -.04, p ＜.001) and family communication with support (B = -.04, p ＜.001) have the strongest influence on depression. (3) Family supportive communication (B = -.05, p ＜.05) is the only predictor that significantly predicts depression among youths from families with an alcohol problem. (4) The positive individual characteristic (B = -.23, p ＜.05) is the only one that significantly predicts depression among youths from families with comorbid alcohol and psychiatric problems. According to the research findings, the implications emphasize the primary prevention of depression through school where Taiwanese youths spend most of their time besides family time. It is important to create a welcoming school environment for every adolescent regardless of their grades and family backgrounds, to provide students with stress-coping training courses, and to encourage students to exercise regularly. Moreover, enhancing services, such as parent-child counseling in Family Education Centers, can help improve family communication with support that further benefits the emotional development of youths regardless of their being in high- or low-risk families.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201712-201801180005-201801180005-29-61,50,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Evaluating The Theoretical Model for Effects of Associated with Deviant Peer on Individual Deviance,Chung-Chin Wu,"Contextual effect, deviance, deviant peer, measurement errors","According to social learning theory, deviant peer serves as learning model of deviances for adolescents. Adolescent learned deviant behavior, they learned deviant motivation and belief behind that behavior as well. It may cause diffusion of deviances. It suggested that part of young adolescents studied in the same classroom/context may behave similar behaviors. A well-known slang: ＂birds of a feather flock together＂ depicted this phenomenon, but it has been neglected in both theoretical literature and empirical researches. By inferring from social learning theory, deviant peers may exert both personal and contextual latent effects on individual deviances. However, contextual effect of deviant peers on deviances has not been addressed. One of possible reasons may also involve limitation on the usage of appropriate analytic methods in the past. There was appropriate statistic method could be used to quantify the effect of context recently. The main purpose of this study was to probe potential contextual effect of deviant peers by introducing alternative method. By using traditional and this alternative, this study considered two aspects which have been ignored: ＂measurement errors＂ and ＂analysis level＂ (single and two-level). Two theoretical models were proposed respectively to represent different consideration of one aspect or both aspects. Single level structural equation model was introduced to consider measurement errors but limited on its ability to take contextual effect into account. While two level structural equation model was used to consider measurement errors and to probe potential contextual effect. Several indices were used to evaluate the most suitable model on investigating the effect of peer deviance on individual deviance. Five thousand and seventy-nine junior high school students nested in one hundred and eighty three classes were sampled by using random cluster sampling method. All of which were consented to participate in this study. Results showed that there were considerable measurement errors resided in the measurements for deviant peer and individual deviance. There were also dependencies resided in observations. It implied the effect of the context in favor of deviances was salient. Combining these evidences suggested that was reasonable to use two level structural equation modeling for considering both effects of measurement errors and dependencies. This method may be not only more suitable and beneficial for probing contextual effect. Further evidences indicated that for individual, associated more with deviant peer resulted in more deviances. In the same token, on average, it showed the same pattern on class level. Specifically, it indicated that as the serious level of association with deviant peers on class level raised, the deeper the deviant problem resided in that context. More importantly, the contextual effect of deviant peers was greater than the individual effect of which. According to results, the contextual effect of deviant peers on individual deviances should be considered in social learning theory and empirical studies in addition to investigate the effect of deviant peers on individual deviances. Comparing to SEM, MSEM was a more useful tool which could be used to investigate explicit and implicit theoretical assumptions or relations. Because the contextual effect was more prominent than the effect on individual level. It suggested the contextual effect of deviant peers should be considered first and treated it seriously. In practical, the contextual effect may be weaken by adapting several methods. The first is context switching which is similar to time-out method. Theoretical, it may be useful for suspending the relationship between deviant peer and individual. Second, counseling methods could be incorporated into curriculum, and teacher should increasing frequency chats with students to understanding what they are thinking, doing and engaging in. The last but not least, it is important for teachers to observe interactions between students during breaking time in school.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201712-201801180005-201801180005-63-87,50,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Effects and Therapeutic Factors of a Counseling Group Based on Bowen's Concept of Differentiation for Adolescents with Codependency in Taiwan,"Chiung-Shan Liu, Shih-Hua Chang","counseling group, codependency, differentiation of self, Bowen theory, Adolescents","Evolving from the treatment of families of alcoholics, the construct of codependency has been expanded and mainly refers to excessively other-oriented caretaking traits and behaviors that are derived from a stressful or dysfunctional family environment. Current research findings and clinical observations have consistently shown codependency traits and related symptoms including low self-esteem, relationship difficulties, and psychological maladjustment among adolescents and college students in both Western countries and Taiwan. However, there is limited work examining and assessing the effectiveness of treatment model based on a theoretical framework for codependency. Chang (2012, 2016) has proposed and provided empirical support for a Bowen-based model of codependency for adolescents and college students in Taiwan. Particularly, differentiation of self was found to be negatively related to codependency traits and was a significant mediator of the relationship between family-of-origin dysfunction and codependency traits. Consistent with previous research, codependency traits were found to be significantly associated with low self-esteem, relationship anxiety and avoidance, as well as psychological adjustment problems including somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to develop a group counseling model based on Bowen's concept of differentiation of self and explore the effects and therapeutic factors of the counseling group for adolescents with codependency in Taiwan. With a mixed method embedded design, the core qualitative method was used to understand participants' perceptions of the helpfulness and therapeutic factors of the counseling group. The supplemental quantitative method was used to examine their changes in measures of differentiation of self, interpersonal competence, and self-concept at the end of the group and a three-month follow up. The group model consisted of eight two-hour sessions for a total of sixteen hours for eight successive weeks. The group goals were to increase members' differentiation of self, to help them understand the impact of their family-of-origin experiences on intimate relationships, as well as to enhance their ability to recognize and take care of their own needs. Participants were six female students in a five-year junior college in Taipei, and their ages ranged from 15 to 18 with a mean age of 16 years. They had an average score higher than 3 on the Chinese version of the Spann-Fischer Codependency Scale, and experienced codependent relationships or had problems in the current or past intimate relationships. With semi-structured interviews and a phenomenological approach, qualitative data were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. Participants' perceptions of the ways in which the group was helpful included: (1) development and differentiation of self, (2) balance of intimacy and autonomy, (3) learning solutions for relationship problems. The therapeutic factors of the group included: (1) awareness of the experiences in family and interpersonal interaction, (2) understanding and resonating with others' experiences, (3) a warm environment of trust and feedback exchange in the group, (4) helping members solve problems. Results of Wilcoxon Matched-Pairs Signed-Ranks tests indicated that participants' levels of differentiation of self, interpersonal competence, and social self-concept improved significantly at the end of the group. Also, their interpersonal competence and social self-concept continued to improve at a three-month follow up. The findings of the study provide preliminarily empirical support for the effectiveness of the Bowen- based treatment group for adolescents with codependency in Taiwan. Counselors and therapists are encouraged to use the group counseling model and extend the group sessions or time for adolescents and college students who struggle with codependent relationships. The implications of the findings for group counseling for codependency as well as suggestions for future research are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201712-201801180005-201801180005-89-121,50,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"A Study on The Relationships among Shyness, Marital Communication and Marital Satisfaction",Su-Mei Su,"multi-group analysis, marital satisfaction, shyness, Marital communication","The vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (VSA) of marital development provides a framework for understanding the variations in marital quality and stability over time (Karney & Bradbury, 1995). Marital outcomes are a function of enduring vulnerabilities, stress events, and adaptive processes in the VSA model of marital development. The VSA model is a comprehensive model that explains how the quality and stability of marriage changes over time. However, this study only focuses on part components of the model. We used the VSA model to test the relationships among enduring vulnerabilities, adaptive processes, and marital quality. The VSA model emphasizes enduring vulnerabilities have direct effects on adaptive processes, and adaptive processes have direct effects on marital quality. Shyness is a personality trait that is stable over time. It is therefore an appropriate representation of enduring vulnerability. Shy individuals possess fewer social skills and abilities to initate discussions. Such low level of relationship self-efficacy may prevent them from managing interpersonal conflicts in families. Because communication is an important determinant in relationship satisfaction, shyness may negatively influence their marital satisfaction. This study examines shyness as enduring vulnerability, marital communication as an adaptive process, and marital satisfaction as indicator of marital quality. We hypothesized that shyness negatively influences marital communication and marital satisfaction, and marital communication positively influences marital satisfaction. Moreover, marital communication plays a mediating role between shyness and marital satisfaction. The subjects were 366 married adults in Taiwan. Structural Equation Modeling was used to analyze the data. Self-report data were gathered through the Shyness Scale revision, the Marital Communication Scale, and the Marital Satisfaction Scale. The Shyness Scale revision requires individuals to report agreement with 24 items using a 5-point Likert response scale. Composite reliability ranged from .77 to .85, and the average variance extracted for each dimension ranged from .41 to .54. The Cronbach α was between .84 and .91. The Marital Communication Scale is a 5-point Likert scale that measures the couples' communication in marriage. The Cronbach α was between .88 and .94. We assessed marital satisfaction using the Marital Satisfaction Scale. This scale asks participants to evaluate their satisfaction in marriage using a 5-point Likert response scale (1=strongly disagree, 5=strongly agree). The Cronbach α was between .73 and .88. The results are as follows: (1) Shyness has negative direct effects on marital communication. Shyness is significantly and negatively associated with marital communication. (2) Marital communication has positive direct effects on marital satisfaction. Marital communication can predict individual marital satisfaction. The better marital communication is, the higher marital satisfaction is. (3) Marital communication completely mediate the relationships between shyness and marital satisfaction. The impact of shyness on individual marital satisfaction is entirely through marital communication. (4) There are significant gender differences on the path coefficient from shyness to marital communication. The path coefficient for males is greater than the coefficient for females, indicating that shyness has worse effects on males' marital communication than females'. In conclusion, this study shows that shyness negatively correlate with marital communication and marital satisfaction. Furthermore, marital communication completely mediate the relationship between shyness and marital satisfaction. The results of this study confirm the relationships among the three elements of ＂vulnerability＂, ＂adaptation process＂ and ＂marital quality＂ in the VSA model of marriage proposed by Karney and Bradbury (1995). The enduring vulnerability of shyness will affect the adaptation process of the individual in marriage, and the adaptation process of the individual in the marriage will affect marital satisfaction. Suggestions and implications for education, counseling, and future research are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201712-201801180005-201801180005-123-159,50,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Associations between Perceived Parenting Behavior and Psychosocial Adjustment of Elementary School Students,Ching-Ling Cheng,"preadolescence, parenting behavior, psychological control, psychosocial adjustment, Behavioral control","The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between elementary school students' perceived controlling parenting and their psychosocial maladjustment. In the present study, controlling parenting was represented by psychological as well as behavioral control. Psychological control refers to parenting behavior that constrains and manipulates children's psychological and emotional experiences, while behavioral control refers to parenting behavior that coercively regulates and demands children's behavior and activity. Psychosocial maladjustment was indicated by emotional difficulties (i.e., emotional symptoms and hyperactivity of SDQ) and experiences of peer victimization (i.e., physical and relational victimization). The hypotheses of the present study were: (1) children's perceived paternal and maternal psychological as well as behavioral control would be, respectively, positively associated with psychosocial maladjustment of early adolescents; (2) children's perceived paternal and maternal behavioral control would positively predict their psychosocial maladjustment, respectively, for boys as well as for girls; and (3) children's perceived paternal and maternal psychological control would positively predict their psychosocial maladjustment, respectively, for boys as well as for girls. The participants were 350 fifth-graders (173 girls and 177 boys; mean age = 10.89 years) from 18 classrooms of 8 elementary schools in 6 counties of Taiwan. Children reported how they perceived, respectively, their fathers' and mothers' controlling parenting (i.e., behavioral and psychological control). Participants also self-reported their emotional difficulties and experiences of peer victimization. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses were conducted separately, by gender of children, for two different forms of parental control to examine the associations between paternal as well as maternal control and children's psychosocial maladjustment. The results demonstrated that the psychological and behavioral forms of controlling parenting delivered by fathers and mothers respectively were associated with children's emotional difficulties and peer victimization. With regard to the effect of behavioral control parenting, the model fit was first examined on all subjects and then separately on boy and girl samples. The SEM results showed that the estimated model was accepted in the girl sample (χ^2 = 19.56, p ＞ .05; RMSEA = .05, CFI = .99, SRMR = .06), but not in the boy sample. Furthermore, there were significant influences of maternal behavioral control on girls' emotional difficulty (γ = .38, p ＜ .01) and peer victimization (γ = .45, p ＜ .001); however, there was no significant effect of paternal behavioral control on girls' psychosocial maladjustment. Thus, while simultaneously considering the effects of behavioral control from fathers and mothers, for young adolescent boys, neither their perceived paternal or maternal behavioral controlling parenting would significantly predict their psychosocial maladjustment. On the other hand, the perceived maternal behavior control of young adolescent girls would predict their psychosocial maladjustment, but not the perceived paternal behavioral control. With regard to the effect of psychological control parenting, the SEM results demonstrated that the estimated models were both accepted in boy (χ^2 = 17.31, p ＞ .05; RMSEA = .05, CFI = .99, SRMR = .04) and girl samples (χ^2= 11.44, p ＞ .05; RMSEA = .00, CFI = 1.00, SRMR = .03). In addition, in boy sample, there was significant influence of paternal psychological control on boys' maladjustment (γ of emotional difficulty = .70, p ＜ .001; γ of peer victimization = .60, p ＜ .001), but no significant maternal influence. On the other hand, in girl sample, there was significant influence of maternal psychological control on girls' maladjustment (γ of emotional difficulty = .63, p ＜ .001; γ of peer victimization = .51, p ＜ .001), but no significant paternal influence. The findings thus demonstrated that, while considering simultaneously the effects of paternal and maternal psychological control, young adolescent boys with higher levels of perceived paternal psychological control tend to have more psychosocial maladjustment, and young adolescent girls with higher levels of perceived maternal psychological control tend to have more psychosocial maladjustment. This is the first study at Taiwan to examine how both paternal and maternal parenting in forms of behavioral as well as psychological control might relate to psychosocial adjustment of preadolescents, with child gender as the moderating factor. Briefly, for boys, only paternal psychological control was associated with their psychosocial maladjustment. For girls, both maternal psychological and behavioral control was related to their psychosocial maladjustment. Implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the harmful effects of parental control on elementary school students' psychosocial adjustment were further discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201712-201801180005-201801180005-161-187,50,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The characteristics of such a reaction to modernism, not only focus on the study of positive behavioral traits, but also contain a number of philosophy and academic paradigm changes. This collection of five practical research papers in this journal of 49th issue, just reflects these characteristics. The emphasis on the growth-oriented of humanism and its belief that human being has the drives of meaning-making and meaning-seeking, the framing of systematic theory, and the more equal helping relationship or research relationship in postmodern thinking indicate the contribution from postmodernism and the first wave of positive psychology; the application of dialectical thinking in Chinese culture reveal the breakthrough of the second wave of positive psychology.

The Development of Group Counseling Working Alliance Scale: Leader-rated Scale,"Lih-Horng Hsieh, Pei-Ju Wu","group working alliance, group leader, group cohesion, Group Counseling, group climate","The therapist-client relationship or the working alliance plays an important role not only in individual counseling but also in group counseling. Group counseling differs from individual counseling in many ways. Group dynamics is particularly attended to in the process of group counseling. The relations among the group members are rather complex because there are a variety of members with multiple relations among them in a counseling group. Besides, the role of the group leader in a counseling group is different from that of the therapist in individual counseling. The group leader creates an atmosphere of interaction in the group process that cultivates the member's self-exposure and lower the pattern of one-way interaction between the leader and the individual. The group leader would only intervene in the mutual interaction among the members in a group process, instead of responding to the individual. The multiple ways of interactions such as group members' observation, reflection, explanation and feedback require a situation different from working alliance in individual counseling. Based on previous studies, assessing the working alliance used in individual counseling indeed has its limit. Developing the working alliance scale specifically used for group counseling would allow us directly and effectively to assess the working alliance between the leader and group members. There is no group counseling working alliance scale up to now in Taiwan. The purpose of this study is to develop leader-rated group counseling working alliance scale (LGCWAS), which helps the group leaders as a tool to assess groups working alliance development, and help to understand the correlation between the leaders group working alliance scale and members of group working alliance, cohesion, and group climate. The development of this scale mainly refers to the relevant alliance literature, the practical experience of training the leadership skills and strategies for leaders in group counseling by the first author, and the group therapy alliance Scale (GTAS) used by the group members, which is developed by Marziali, Munroe-Blum and McCleary (1997). An original scale is formed by inviting five domestic experts in guidance and counseling to test expert validity on the scale structure and items. The group counseling leaders are tested using this scale. Through evaluating the participants' attitude toward the group therapy working alliance, there are 179 effective questionnaires in total from 31 different groups. We apply confirmatory factor analysis to test the internal consistency and validity of scale construction and its criterion-related validity as a reference for testing the reliability and validity of this assessment tool. After the item analysis and confirmatory factor analysis of the original scale data are carried out, we keep all the items and develop the formal scale with 36 items in total. These results reveal that the three categories in the Content Dimension are Goal, Task, and Bond; the four categories in the Interpersonal Dimension are Self-Therapist, Other-Therapist, Group-Therapist, and within system. The result reveals that the Cronbach's α is .96, Content Dimension Cronbach's α between .89 and .90; Interpersonal Dimension Cronbach's α between .84 and .88. It can be readily seen that the leaders group working alliance scale has good internal consistency. For the criterion-related validity, the correlation between leader-rated group counseling working alliance scale and member-rated group counseling working alliance scale is .12(p ＜ .01). The correlation between leaders group working alliance scale and cohesion is .13(p ＜ .01). The correlation between leaders group working alliance scale and engagement, avoidance, and conflict is .07, -.10, and -.18 respectively (p ＜ .01). These results indicate that the leaders group working alliance scale has good validity as well. This research is consistent with the results reported in the literature as well as the theoretical hypotheses. High working alliance group has high group cohesion. The involvement of group members has positive correlation with the group working alliance. In other words, the high working alliance between the leader and the group members would lead to high involvement in the group process assessed by the group members. On the contrary, the avoidance and conflict assessed by the group members have negative correlation with the working alliance between the leader and the group members. In other words, the low score in the leaders group working alliance scale would lead to more avoidance and conflict of group members. Based on our findings, we make some suggestions for the application of group counseling working alliance scale, the group leaders, professional training in group counseling and future research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201708-201709060017-201709060017-17-51,49,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Joy Share with Others Is More Joyful: Interpersonal Relationship as a Mediator between Optimistic Explanatory Style and Well-being,"Pei-Hsin Li, Ling-Hui Chu, Min-Ning Yu","Interpersonal relationship, well-being, optimistic explanatory style, mediator variable","Recently, the public has put an increasing emphasis on the psychological health and happiness of primary school students, which calls for a continued effort to explore and develop this area. Previous studies found that an individual's optimistic attitude may affect his or her view about the environment, and may influence his or her well-being as an individual. Individuals who are more optimistic tend to respond positively to stress and handle stressful situations more successfully. In addition, not only are children's optimistic explanatory styles affected by their personalities, the interaction between family and school is also another important contributor. However, there are few studies that focus on children's optimistic explanatory styles and its relationship with interpersonal relationships. Hence, the present study aims in understanding the mediating role of children's interpersonal relationship between optimistic explanatory style and well-being. In the current study, we regarded optimism as an attributional style that it is the way in which children explain the causes of events happen in their lives. Children who are optimistic tend to believe that negative events are external, unstable, and specific. Thus, we supposed that children's well-being relates to optimistic explanatory style in a positive way. In addition, children's relationships with their classmates, family, and teachers are included in the study. Previous studies found that children with better interpersonal relationships may have much better well-being. In this study, we hypothesized that children's interpersonal relationship influences their well-being, and the interpersonal relationship plays a mediating role between optimistic explanatory style and well-being. The present study was conducted using a sample randomly selected from five elementary schools in North Taiwan from 2010 to 2012. A total of 1322 sixth grade students were selected from the fifth wave of the three-year longitudinal data set. To test the hypotheses we conducted, data was analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) using LISREL 8.7. Self-report data were gathered through Optimistic Explanatory Style Scale, Interpersonal Relationship Scale, and Subjective Well-Being Scale. For Optimistic Explanatory Style Scale, children responded each item regarding how they viewed each event, either unstable or external event, with KR20 of 0.44 and 0.42 respectively. Interpersonal relationship scale is a 4-point Likert scale that includes children's relationship with their classmates, family, and teachers, with Cronbach's alpha of .88. Subjective Well-Being Scale is a 4-point Likert scale that measures children's overall positive emotion and life satisfaction, with Cronbach's alpha of .90. The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed that the model had a good fit to the data. Results from the present study showed that there is a positive relationship between children's optimistic explanatory style and well-being. That is, children who are more likely to view events as external or unstable have higher well-being scores. Another contribution of the study is the mediating role of interpersonal relationship between children's optimistic explanatory style and well-being. In our study, we also found that children's interpersonal relationship is positively associated with their well-being. Moreover, interpersonal relationship fully mediated the relationship between optimistic explanatory style and well-being. In conclusion, the current study showed that elementary school students' optimistic explanatory style positively correlated with interpersonal relationship and well-being. Furthermore, interpersonal relationship fully mediated the relationship between optimistic explanatory style and well-being. Accordingly, interpersonal relationship plays an important role in facilitating the well-being of students. We suggest that teachers and parents should support students in a positive way, encourage children to cultivate optimistic attitude, and pay more attention to the peer relationship with other students. The other implications for future research and practice are also proposed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201708-201709060017-201709060017-53-77,49,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"A Study on the Relationship among Growth Themes, Meaningfulness, and Psychological Maturity of Taiwanese Adults","Hui-Tuz Chang, Yih-Lan Liu","Psychological maturity, meaningfulness, social-cognitive maturity, social-emotional wellbeing, growth themes","Based on concept of psychological maturity in personality psychology (Bauer & McAdams, 2004), this study defines two forms of personality development: social-cognitive maturity (SCM) and social-emotional well-being (SEWB). SCM deals with how complexly ones think about the self and others, and how their lives have organized in the world in increasingly complex ways. It is frequently measured by Loevinger's measure of ego development (Loevinger, 1976; Hy and Loevinger, 1996). SEWB, based on self-determination theory, deals with how good one feels about the self in a world of others (Ryan & Deci, 2001). SCM and SEWB were expected to relate differentially to two forms of growth themes: Agentic-grwoth tehms and Communal-growth themes. Agentic-growth themes (e.g., emphasizing power) correlated primarily with SCM, and communal-growth themes (e.g., emphasizing intimacy) correlated primarily with SEWB (Bauer & McAdams, 2004b). Growth themes from personal memories are narratives of specific events in a person's life. They complete with a visual image of the event and attendant thoughts and feelings that the person remembers experiencing at the time of the event (Brewer, 1986). Growth themes often provide meaning or even contribute to a sense of meaning. A strong sense of meaning is associated with well-being (Emmons, 2003). How people construct their growth themes and make meaning of these themes greatly depend on personality. This study explores the characteristics of psychological maturity in Taiwanese adults and examines the relationships among personality, growth themes, meaningfulness, and psychological maturity. 102 participants were recruited through snowball sampling from Taiwan. The participants' ages ranged from 18-57 years old (average age = 26.78; male, N = 44; married = 11; student = 57). The participants completed the scales of Washington University Sentence Completion Test (WUSCT), Psychological Well-being (PWB), and Big- Five Inventory (BFI), and they were asked to write down their life stories (Growth Themes). The participants completed a booklet typically took 2-6 hours to complete. Regression model was used to examine the meaningfulness would moderate the relationship between growth themes and ego development. Results showed that the average stage of ego development for participants was between Self-Aware stage and conscientious stage. Older participants displayed a higher level of ego development. Moreover, majority of people agreed with that life brings positive emotion in everyday. Consistent with previous findings, PWB and SCM were not significantly correlated. Furthermore, the results of regression analysis indicated that personality was positively correlated with social emotion well-being, but didn't correlate with meaningfulness. Extraversion personality was positively related to the growth themes derived from life stories. In the description of the peak experience in life stories, making meanings to achievement themes was positively correlated with SCM. On the other hand, when describing nadir experience, experiencing academic setback and poor job performance was negatively correlated with SWB. Finally, the meaningfulness moderated the relationship between growth themes and ego development for participants when describing achievement themes in peak experience. The overall findings are summarized in three parts. First, the non-significant relationship between SCM and SWB indicates that these two perspectives of maturity develop independently. Moreover, the two growth themes mapped differentially onto measures of SCM and SWB, suggesting that the different underlying reasons that people for their life experience relate to specific kinds of personality development. Second, Taiwanese adults describe the achievement themes more often than communion themes. When people describe more achievement themes in peak experiences, they tend to develop a higher level of ego development. Third, when people make more meaning of achievement themes in peak experiences, they tend to display a higher ego development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201708-201709060017-201709060017-79-112,49,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Construction and Function of Systematic Optimism/Pessimism in Mental Adjustment,"Yun-An Chou, Kun-Hu Chen","Defensive pessimism, functional optimism, mental adjustment, optimism","Optimists are individuals who expect good things to happen to them; pessimists are individuals who expect bad things to happen to them. Optimists and pessimists differ in several ways that have varying degrees of impact on their lives and adaptations. They differ in how they perceive stressed they encounter, and they differ in the manner with which they cope with life's difficulties. Past research generally considered optimism a character that brings individuals better physical and mental health, and more active coping strategies. For example, optimists differ from pessimists in the subjective well-being they enjoy when experiencing various kinds of adversity and difficulties. Optimists usually perceive lower stress and have better physical and mental health than pessimists (Chang & Farrehi, 2001; Iwanaga, Yokoyama, & Seiwa, 2004). Optimists also have lower degree of depressed and anxious levels while encounter life's difficulties. Besides, optimists more adopted active and proactive coping strategies than pessimists (Brissette, Scheier, & Carver, 2002). In other words, optimists are faster to accept the reality of a challenge to their current lives. They appear to engage in more focused, active coping when such efforts are likely to be productive. They are less likely to show signs of disengagement or giving up pursuit of their goals (Carver & Scheier, 2003). There is also evidence that optimism was related to better physical and mental health outcomes in certain circumstances (Carver & Scheier, 2001; Wrosch & Scheier, 2003). However, researchers still doubt about the perspectives of ＂whether optimism is beneficial to mental adjustment＂ (Norem & Chang, 2002) and ＂whether pessimism is not beneficial to mental adjustment＂ (Schwarzer, 1994; Wallston, 1994). For example, Schwarzer (1994) indicated that ＂defensive optimism＂ might bring individuals physical and psychological harms. Cantor et al. (1987) considered ＂defensive pessimism＂ as contributing to negative expectations, yet bring action to avoid potential risk. This study suggested that elucidating characters of optimism and pessimism should include the positive/negative expectations and the types of coping simultaneously. Different combinations of expectations and coping would demonstrate different working mechanisms in mental adjustment. However, past researchers although provide different concepts of optimism/pessimism (e.g., defensive optimism and defensive pessimism), lack of measuring tools to tackle with these concepts. Therefore, the goal of the study adopted ＂positive/negative expectations＂ as well as ＂engagement /disengagement＂ as two dimensions to distinguish optimism and pessimism to ＂functional optimism＂, ＂dysfunctional optimism＂, ＂functional pessimism＂ and ＂dysfunctional pessimism.＂ This study further investigated the functions of mental adjustment with these four optimistic and pessimistic types. The data was collected from a total of 134 college students (Female = 60.4%; Male = 39.6%) and the researchers of this study conducted item analysis, exploratory/confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency, criterion-related validity to examine the scale’s reliability and validity. The results showed four optimistic and pessimistic types (i.e., functional optimism, dysfunctional optimism, functional pessimism, ＂dysfunctional pessimism) have good reliability and validity. In addition, the study found that each type played different roles in metal adjustment. In the hierarchical analysis, functional optimism and dysfunctional optimism positively predicted to satisfaction of life, functional pessimism negatively predicted to satisfaction of life. Among them, functional optimism was the best predictor to satisfaction of life. Functional optimism positively predicted to depressed symptoms, functional pessimism negatively predicted to depressed symptoms. Among them, functional pessimism was the best predictor to depressed symptoms. Functional pessimism was the only and positive predictor to anxious symptoms. Dysfunctional optimism was the only and positive predictor to procrastination. In summary, the results of the study helps to clarify the issues of ＂optimism is beneficial to mental adjustment＂ and ＂pessimism is not beneficial to mental adjustment.＂",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201708-201709060017-201709060017-113-145,49,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Effects of a Solution-Focused Supervisors' Training Program for School Counselors,"Wei- Su Hsu, Yu-Hsuan Yu","supervisors' training, school counselor supervision, Solution-Focused Supervision, Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model","The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of a Solution-Focused Supervision (SFS) training program for senior high school counselors. This study used a mixed method design. Fifteen senior high school counselors underwent a total of 51-hours of SFS training over 8.5-days The program contained four parts: (a) supervision, including instruction on basic concepts, rules, forms, and ethics of supervision; (b) SFS, including the important characteristics, components, processes, skills, and forms of SFS; (c) discussing the multi-faceted role of the school counselor and existing school counselor supervisory models; and (d) how to combine SFS with school counselor supervision and how to prepare for an SFS supervisor. All the trainees attended two focus-group interviews, one right after training and the second one month later. During the interviews, all trainees completed reaction sheets and the learning self-report inventory. All participants also completed the Supervisory Competence Scale and readiness assessment sheets before and after their training. After one month of training, all trainees were required to submit one supervisee's feedback sheet. To solicit more detailed feedback about the training program, 4 trainees who had full attendance participated in semi-structured interviews. The data of the reaction sheets and learning self-report inventory were analyzed through descriptive statistics while a paired-sample t test was conducted on the readiness assessment sheet and supervisory competence scale. After performing a homogeneity test, a dependent sample t test was conducted. In addition, the qualitative data was analyzed by qualitative methodology. The method used by the qualitative analysis team was open coding. The Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Model was used to evaluate the effect of this SFS training program. The main four levels of the Kirkpatrick's Four-Level Model include: (a) Reaction, the trainees' feelings toward the program; (b) Learning, the degree of trainees' acquisition of knowledge, skills, and attitudes; (c) Behavior, what has been learned is expressed in trainees' concrete behaviors; and (d) Results, the impact of training on the trainees' organization. Different qualitative and quantitative research data were selected and analyzed for each level. The results found trainee improvements in all four levels of Kirkpatrick's model. For the Reaction level, trainees reported high satisfaction with the program, and especially appreciated the content of the program and training methods. Peer learning and peer support were mentioned positively by most of the trainees. For the Learning level, there was a significant difference in the scores for the Supervisory Competence Scale, which demonstrates that the trainees improved their knowledge (t = -7.22, p ＜ .001, d = 4.13), attitudes (t = -5.56, p ＜ .001, d = 2.97), and behaviors (t = -6.36, p ＜ .001, d = 3.40). The difference between the pretest and posttest scores on the learning self-report inventory was also significant. Moreover, this SFS training program enhanced the trainees' readiness to supervise school counselors, ability to conduct self-supervision, and also simultaneously increased their competencies as a school counselor. For the Behavior level, trainees implemented SFS as a supervisor. They additionally internalized the concepts of the solution focused approach into their work and changed behaviors in their personal lives. Finally, for the Results level, both the trainees and their supervisees achieved their supervision goals and felt empowered during the process of supervision. The clients of supervisees also reported positive changes. All trainees indicated their school counseling work and communication with staff became more efficacious. This study supports the SFS model as an effective and highly practical model, and fits campus culture in Taiwan. Based on these findings, the study discusses the factors present in this SFS training program that either facilitated or hampered learning, and provides suggestions for SFS training, government policies for the supervision system in school, and future studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201708-201709060017-201709060017-147-182,49,2017,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

When the First Baby Arrives: Parental Involvement and Marital Satisfaction among New Parents,"Jia-Feng Chen, Huey-Ya Lin, Ying-Ling Hsiao","marital satisfaction, new parents, couples' intimate interaction, parental involvement","This study investigated changes in marital satisfaction in the transition to parenthood for newlywed couples over the first 3 years of marriage. In addition, this study examined the relationships among parental involvement, couples' intimate interaction, and marital satisfaction before and after the first baby arrived, as well as spousal influences in such relationships. The sample included 71 couples, 50 who became parents during the second year of marriage and 21 who became parents during the third year. Findings showed that during the transition to parenthood, both husbands and wives experienced declines in marital satisfaction. Marital satisfaction before the first child arrived was significantly associated with husbands' involvement in child care, but not related to wives' involvement. Husbands' involvement in child care was not associated with their perceptions of intimate interaction and marital satisfaction after the birth of the child. However, wives' involvement in child care indirectly influenced their marital satisfaction after the birth of the child through intimate interaction. Not only did wives' involvement in child care directly affect husbands' marital satisfaction after the birth of the child, but it also indirectly affected husbands' marital satisfaction after the birth of the child through intimate interaction. These results showed an actor effect indicating a spillover between marital and parent-child subsystems, as well as a partner effect indicating a crossover from wives' parent-child subsystem to husbands' marital subsystem.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201612-201701060008-201701060008-91-111,47,2016,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
A Study of Break-Up Adjustment in Taiwan Same-Sex Couples: A Life Course Perspective,Wen-Yi Shieh,"life course, gay / lesbian, break-up adjustment, same sex couple relationship","In this study, the author examines how same-sex couples adjust when their relationship ends, and how the break-up experience varies according to different life stages and cohorts. Interviews were conducted with 32 gay men and 35 lesbians who had experienced a break-up of an intimate relationship. There were 21 participants from the age group of 20-29, 26 from the age group of 30-39, and 20 from the age group of 40-59 to represent different generation. It was found that the most commonly used adjustment strategies were displacement; seeking support from one's social network; self-empowerment; adopting the viewpoint of predestination; and choosing negative ways to adjust. In addition, the author used a life course perspective to examine break-up experiences at different life stages within a historical and cultural context. From this perspective, the author found that Chinese same-sex couples experience ＂hidden couple relationships,＂ ＂society transition and cohort differences,＂ and ＂personal life development stages.＂ According to different life experiences and social backgrounds, these participants from different cohorts experienced relationship break-ups differently. Due to the structural changes of society, age differences, life experiences, and personal emotional/cognitive changes, the different strategies used brought about new transformations and development in the life path.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201612-201701060008-201701060008-113-143,47,2016,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Counseling Practice With Gay or Bisexual Men: A Multicultural Counseling Perspective,"Chih-Lung Kao, Nien-Hwa Lai","gay or bisexual clients, multicultural counseling and therapy, LGB counseling","This article discusses the factors related to the counseling practice with gay or bisexual men from a multicultural counseling perspective. By interviewing three gay or bisexual clients about their counseling experiences and analyzing the data with thematic analysis, the researcher concluded seven important factors: client-center, aiming client's personal issues, appropriate conseling skills, knowledge about gay community, awareness of special social issues related to gay identity, authentic sympathy or supportiveness to client's gay identity or experiences, openness to client's various experences in gay culture, which counselors should pay attention to in order to work effectively with gay or bisexual clients. On the other hand, four ineffective counseling practices were also identified: anxiety about or avoidance of gay issues, insensitivity to gay issues, insisting on evaluating client's gay identity, implicit prejustice against gay in neutral languages or attitudes.

A Pilot Study on the Process of Cultivating Mindfulness,"Ya-Chih Cheng, Shu-Ling Huang","meditation practice, mental health, mindfulness-based intervention","Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) integrates meditation, yoga, body scan and some cognitive-behavioral interventions to release pressure and prevent relapse of depression. The positive effects of MBI on reducing negative emotions and improving well-being have been supported. However, research regarding the process of cultivating mindfulness and the role of homework practice in this process is limited. Purpose: the aims of this study were (1) to investigate the processes of cultivating mindfulness successfully and unsuccessfully when MBI was adopted and (2) to explore the role of homework practice in these processes. Method: the study adopted the qualitative research method. Fifteen focus groups (49 adult participants) were conducted at the end of the 4th session and the 8th session, and one month after the completion of MBI. Results: the study found that the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness had four specific steps: being confused at the beginning, gaining benefits during exploration, experiencing changes after MBI, and adopting the attitude of mindfulness in daily life. In the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness, the acquisition of knowledge and the perception of experiences were equally important. Homework practice itself played a key role in experiencing mindfulness and becoming habituated to mindful awareness during the learning course. We also point out when and who might have difficulties with the cultivation of mindfulness. Conclusions: the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness included four steps. In addition, when and who might have difficulties with the cultivation of mindfulness and the benefits of homework practice in the process of successfully cultivating mindfulness were identified. These indicators would enable group facilitators to detect and prevent them as early as possible so that all group members could cultivate their mindfulness successfully.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201608-201609130007-201609130007-63-91,46,2016,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Constructing a Typology for Court-Referred Males of Intimate Partner Violence based on Changing Relationalism Perspectives,Hsien-Huei Chiou,"domestic violence, cultural change, typology, chinese","Males who commit intimate partner violence vary across cases, so a practical and valid typological frame work is essential for understanding the psychological mechanisms and characteristics of male perpetra-torsviolence. However, many well-known western typologies have not considered traditional Chinese Relationalism and the changing context within the Taiwanese society. Additionally, existing typologies are often based on female descriptions about male batterers; thus, they are limited in terms of their utility in understanding the subjective phenomenon of male batterers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to construct an indigenous typology according to the narratives of male perpetrators within the context of Chinese Relationalism and its changing situation within the Taiwanese society. In addition, this study also considered the crime diaries of male batterers, forensic documents, and court statements. To achieve this goal, this study followed the constructivism paradigm and adopted the consensual qualitative research approach method to analyze the text. Twenty four interviewees were invited as participants for semi-structural in-depth interviews; they had committed intimate partner violence and violated domestic law. The results indicated that the interviewees could be divided into four types according to the following five dimensions: Reflect related to Relationalism patriarchy; criticism to role duties of partners; concerns about parenting; alcoholic use; and personality disorder and clinical symptoms. The four types are as follows: Self-modification, following-law and tradition, distress, and fighting-back.

Narrative and dyadic study methods were applied in this study. Participants were consisted of a transgender and his sister. Data analyzation was based on ‘holistic-content’ approach. The results showed that lack of friendly information on gender identity exploration brought more suffering to the transgender. Issues including self-acceptance, a cut-off from one’s previous life, and psychophysical distresses were affected them in the transition process. Acceptance and understanding from his significant others were important for him to build up self-identity. Although the coping strategies were changed from rigid to more flexible, the transgender and his family still go through complicated emotions. Opposition and avoidance by family members raised their conflicts, but formation of alliance, adjustment of communication strategy, and a mutual understanding between the transgender and family managed to improve their interactions and strengthen the transgenders’ support system.

The framework of the group program was based on ＂The Relationship Intimacy Model of Couple Adaptation to Cancer＂ proposed by Sharon Manne and Hoda Badr in 2008. 5 breast cancer couples agreed to participate in the 13-hour workshop after having read and signed the informed consents in 2010. Participants wrote the group feedback forms immediately after the workshop and were interviewed by researchers two months later. The follow-up explanations model was used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data. The results showed this group program had brought some benefits to facilitating breast cancer couples’ intimacy. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The group program enhanced the quality of couples’ intimacy. After the group program, couples showed improvements on their communication. Namely, to express themselves appropriately, to appreciate partners positively, to increase mutual understanding, to decrease conflicts, and to learn self-awareness and reflection on interactions. (2) Couples considered that using body language to communicate intimacy and creating artwork corporately were the most effective group activities. (3) Group programs facilitating couples’ intimacy encouraged couples to narrate their cancer experiences, learning to appreciate partners positively and to form a safe and cozy atmosphere.

The Relationship between Sexual Harassment Experiences and Depression: Traumatic Reaction as Mediator with Gender as Moderator,"Hsiu-Ling Peng, Li-Li Huang, Ren-Hau Li","depression, sexual harassment, gender, traumatic reaction","This study aims to investigate the relationship between sexual harassments experiences (SHE), depression, and traumatic reaction of college students in Taiwan, and the influences of gender on SHE and their relation with depression or traumatic reaction. Data were collected through a questionnaire including participants' demographic information, Sexual Harassment Questionnaire (SHQ), BDI-II and Posttraumatic Stress Reaction Index (PTSDRI). Among 682 valid questionnaires, 480 college students (146 males and 334 females) reported that they have been sexually harassed, and these cases would be used for data analysis later. The results showed that the factor structure of SHE for Taiwanese college students was similar to that found in Western society. In addition to sexual coercion, gender harassment, and unwanted sexual attention factors, the Taiwanese sample had an additional physical harassment factor. Among these factors, females experienced significantly more unwanted sexual attention than males, but there were no significant sex differences for all other factors. Furthermore, females reported more traumatic reaction and depressive symptoms, but this was not the case for males who experienced more SHE. Therefore, gender is a moderator between SHE and traumatic reaction as well as between SHE and depressive symptoms. Moreover, path analysis showed that traumatic reaction completely mediated the association between SHE and depressive symptoms for Taiwanese female college students, while the mediation effect was not found for Taiwanese male students. Hence, females are more likely to develop traumatic reaction than males after experiencing SHE; and if the traumatic reaction was not properly treated, depression would follow.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201512-201601070005-201601070005-105-132,44,2015,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Development and Initial Validation of the Intake Objective Structured Clinical Examination,"Yu-Ling Lan, Yu-Hsuan Chang, Wan-Lan Chen","objective structured clinical examination, performance assessment, psychological assessment competency","Influenced by the competency-based movement, psychologists have begun to reconsider what has been missing in the education and evaluation of psychologists, and advocate the importance of competency- based evaluation in professional psychology. In the last four decades, Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) has been widely adopted in health-related disciplines to measure clinician's knowledge, skills and attitudes. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the intake OSCE, a competency-based evaluation for measuring master students' competencies in psychological assessment when conducting an intake interview. The intake OSCE included a standardized patient test (SP test), a follow-up short answer test (S test), and a multiple-choice test (M test). In this study, 27 graduate students in training were recruited to examine the psychometric properties of this test. Results of this study indicated that the Cronbach's alpha values of the total and subscale scores of the SP test were all above .80; and the inter-rater reliability of the S test was .75. The moderate positive correlation between the history taking subscale scores of the SP test and the S test total scores suggested the convergent validity of the intake OSCE. The weak positive association between the M test total scores and the SP subscale scores also indicated the divergent validity of this test. As a newly developed test, intake OSCE demonstrates good reliability and validity. Since the present study only provided initial validation of this test, more research needs to be done to provide further psychometric evidence for the intake OSCE.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201512-201601070005-201601070005-133-158,44,2015,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Satisfactions of Career Compromise: The Moderator Effect of Educational Opportunity Structure,"Chin-Lun Tsai, Sy-Feng Wang","career aspirations, school to work transitions, career opportunity structure, vertical-horizontal compromise, circumscription-compromise theory","The unemployment rate of university students is much higher than that of other age groups in Taiwan. The unemployment problem is generally attributed to high educational levels and low employment, as well as the education-job gap. This study was based on circumscription-compromise theory of the social- psychological perspective, and consisted of. Two two types of compromise: a vertical (high educational level and low employment) and a horizontal compromise (the education-job correlation), and also emphasized the moderating effect of education opportunity structure (liberal arts & science vs. professional schools) between two types of compromise and three types of satisfaction. To test the theoretical model, we utilized data drawn from a sample of alumnus who were graduated from 2007 and 2008th academic year at Fu Jen University in Taiwan and had a year of work experience. We tested hypotheses using multiple regression and structural equation modeling. The results illustrated that the main effects of vertical and horizontal compromise were found to have negatively impact on satisfaction of school to work transition. Moreover, the negative effect of vertical compromise was higher than that of the horizontal compromise. The findings also indicated that the moderating effect of opportunity structures could increase the effect of compromise on satisfaction of school to work transition. Students graduated from liberal art schools were more concerned about vertical compromise than horizontal compromise. On the other hand, students graduated from professional schools were more concerned with horizontal compromise than vertical compromise. Finally, career satisfaction across both end of the school and work is more suitable as criterion of compromise. This study suggested that: (1) Career compromise concept is converted to type-based by strength-based; (2) Opportunity structure is demonstrated to the moderating paradigm in approach of circumscription-compromise theory. For counseling practice, the intervention of compromise may enhance students recognition of occupational self. The intervention may also enhance student's expectations and perceptions of the education opportunity structure that could reduce compromise effect in their career. Hence, the occupational information system as the approach of the intervention might be worth consideration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201508-201509020003-201509020003-1-33,43,2015,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Fifteen counselor trainees enrolled in a counseling practice course undertook four group supervision sessions (i.e., first 2 sessions were based on the cyclic developmental model and last 2 sessions were conducted by the reflecting team). They wrote reflection notes after each supervision session. Sixty reflection notes were content analyzed. The results were: All the counselor trainees reported that they benefited a lot from the group supervision process. Peer discussion, vicarious learning and demonstration were most appropriate for their learning style. They realized and confronted their own anxiety, and became more motivated for learning. Group supervision enhanced their professional competencies in three dimensions: understanding more about the client, the counseling interventions and the process.

A Study of the Status and Cause for Students with Disabilities Being Bullied by the Peers in Inclusive Classes: Take One Junior High School Setting as an Example,"Fang-Ling Lo, Tai-Hwa Lu","inclusive education, students with disabilities, school bully","The purpose of this study was to explore the condition of students with disabilities who were bullied by their peers and the reasons for being bullied in inclusive classes in a junior high school. This research attempted to understand bullying problems through conducting interviews with bullied students with disabilities, teachers, and bullying students. Relevant files, documents and observations were also collected and analyzed for understanding the current status and the causes of being bullied. Subsequently a proposed anti-bully mentoring program was formulated based on the findings. The main findings of this study were as follows: The primary bullying behaviors found in the study were common in the typical school ground, such as physical bullying, verbal bullying and interpersonal bullying. Peer bullies in the inclusive classroom could be categorized into those of overt bulling type and covert bullying type. Although the overt bullying type students were just a few in number they exhibited explicit bullying behaviors. The majority of the bullying behaviors, however, were the covert type - these students overlooked bullying behaviors by other students and participated in subtle bullying behaviors themselves (such as isolating and excluding the bullied victim). The reasons for being bullied by students with disabilities include: having a poor academic standing, exhibiting atypical behaviors, having poor social skills, causing disruptions in their classes, and being unable to fit the norms of their peer group. These above behaviors often rendered bullied students the target of dislike by their peers and set off bullying behaviors by peers. When teachers intervened by applying the approach that “highlights the needs and weaknesses of students with disabilities to incur compassion” in dealing with bully incidences, it often ended up stigmatizing the bullied students further. Inadvertently, the process ostracizes the bullied students with disability even more and exacerbates the uneven power relation among the students in a regular classroom. In addition, the services provided by resource classroom teachers were inadequate in addressing the bullying situations suffered by students with disabilities. Finally, based on the above findings this paper offers some suggestions for implementing anti-bullying intervention programs in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201504-201505200015-201505200015-1-34,42,2015,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Healing Objects and Their Role in the Grief Adaptation Process and Experience of Undergraduate Students,Tseng-Ying Cheng,"undergraduate students, healing objects, grief adaptation","The purpose of this study was to understand the relationship between undergraduate students' healing objectives and grief adaptation process in terms of the experience, the effect, and the meaning. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 university students who voluntarily participated in this research. A phenomenological approach to data analysis was adopted, and the following 3 main themes and 10 subthemes emerged. Theme 1 - Interaction with healing objects includes: (a) the objects being used in private space and time; (b) interaction with personified objects by imagining that they possess human emotions; (c) relationship maintained for several years; and (d) identification by others did not affect personal feelings toward the objects. Theme 2 - Healing effects includes: (a) stabilization of emotions while expressing positive feelings; (b) healing effect could not be replaced by ＂human beings＂; and (c) grief gradually disappeared without being constrained by the objects. Theme 3 - Meaning of healing objects for undergraduates includes: (a) taking good care of the objects; essential materials might have changed but the symbolism could not be replaced; (b) the healing objects could ease as well as trigger grief; and (c) lessons learned from the healing objects are helpful for future grief adaptation. Based on these findings, this study suggests that practitioners should consider healing objects positively when performing grief counseling, explore the functions the objects serve and the meanings these objects manifest, and help clients develop specific coping perspective and resilience in facing their adversities.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201504-201505200015-201505200015-35-61,42,2015,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

A method of phenomenological analysis was applied to the descriptions of supervisees' experience. The descriptions were obtained from six counselor participants after they received experientially-based supervision approach and then worked with their clients for one or two more counseling sessions following the supervision. In this research the experiential supervision approach was implemented with the supervisees playing the role of their clients and the supervisor performed psychodrama to the supervisees. The results of the study identified the structural contents of experientially-based supervision approach from the supervisees' perspectives. First, when the supervisees played the role of clients in supervision, they obtained a deep comprehension of the clients' experiences and their understanding of the clients' problems was deepened. Second, the supervisor's therapy (psychodrama therapy) promoted a transformative bodily experience on the part of the supervisees. Thirdly, the supervisees were more able to reflect on their counseling process from a broad and global perspective, enhance their understanding of the clients and improve upon their therapy with the clients. This in turns enabled counselor supervisees to help their clients to experience bodily feelings and transformative bodily experiences. On the basis of this study, various important features of experientially-based supervision approach are considered and discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201504-201505200015-201505200015-63-91,42,2015,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
"Mindfulness, Self-healing and Psychological Adaptation-The Mediating Effects of Self-compassion and Self-disparagement","Chih-Chao Lai, Lun-Hui Su","depression, self-compassion, self-disparagement, mindfulness, self-healing","This research aims to investigate the mediating effects of self-compassion and self-disparagement among mindfulness, self-healing and psychological adaptation. The research used a purposive sampling survey method. Participants were 345 students enrolled at two universities located in Midwest Taiwan. The results of the study showed that female participants scored significantly lower on the self-compassion scale and the two subscales of self-healing (mindfulness and calmness) than did those male participants, but female participants also reported higher level of depression than did male participants. Partial analyses revealed that self-compassion and self-disparagement partially correlated with psychological adaptation more than did with mindfulness. The present researchers developed a MCA model and the results showed that the model appropriately explained how mindfulness via self-healing, self-compassion and self-disparagement predicted subjective well-being and psychological adaptation. Self-compassion and self-disparagement were full mediating factors between mindfulness and self-healing as well as psychological adaptation. Self-healing partially mediated between mindfulness and self-compassion as well as self-disparagement. In addition, self-compassion and self-disparagement played differentiated roles in predicting psychological adaption. While self-compassion strongly predicted subjective well-being, self-disparagement strongly predicted depression and common mental disorders. Enhanced self-healing resulted from bare attention (mindfulness) improved self-compassion, which was the source of subjective well-being. As Chinese culture emphasizes self-harshness Chinese people are pronged to engage in self-disparagement, which may lead to depression and common mental disorders. With mindfulness, self-disparagement tendency in Chinese individuals might be alleviated.

Midlife transition is considered more and more as a normal part of life nowadays. According to social psychologists midlife crisis might occur during ages 40-65 for an individual. The term crisis is not appropriate because the experience is often accompanied by serious depression, excessive worrying and unhappiness. Owing to the uniqueness of the target population in this study, a convenient sampling method was adopted to select an elementary teacher who was dealing with midlife crisis with respect to his pursuit of status and career, and his personality difficulty. Thirteen 60-minute each, weekly in-depth interview sessions were conducted with the client participant. The entire interview was audio-recorded with the client's consent. Following each in-depth interview session, the recorded verbatim was hand typed. Subsequently qualitative analysis of the data was conducted. In addition, the MAXQDA software was used - a program that supports qualitative data analysis. The results of the study include the client's story, the counseling process, the client's change, and the impact the client experienced following the counseling intervention.

Losing Face and Emotions in a Social Comparison Situation: The Effects of Face-Sharing Member and the Openness of Situation,Kuei-Hsiang Han,"losing face, social comparison, emotion, social-contingent self-esteem","This study focused on the effects of ＂forced comparison (the message of ＂I'm worse than others＂ was perceived by oneself) and ＂third party comparison (the same message was stated by others)＂ on participants' feelings of losing face and emotions. The results showed that participants rated higher degree of no face in the context of third party comparison than that of forced comparison. Participants in both contexts experienced the feelings of depression and embarrassment. When the comparison was made by the third party, participants also experienced the feelings of being humiliated and hurt. The condition of ＂forced comparison＂ was further divided into two groups: there was vs. there was not a face-sharing member (mother) in the context. The results showed that participants experienced higher degree of losing face when there was a family member in the context. In addition to the basic feelings of depression and embarrassment, participants also experienced the feelings of regret and guilty with the presence of a family member. Similarly, the condition of ＂third party comparison＂ was further divided into two groups: stating the message ＂privately＂ vs. ＂publicly＂. The results indicated that if one's bad performance was stated publicly rather than privately, one would experience stronger feelings of losing face. As to the emotions, participants experienced depression, embarrassment, regret, and guilty feelings when in a private situation. On the contrary, if the situation was in front of others, participants would still experience the feelings of depression and embarrassment along with humiliation, hurt, and anger.

Love You or Hate You-Interpersonal Intimacy Competence in the Patients with Borderline Personality,"Ching-Chun Ku, Zai-Ting Yeh, I-Chao Liu","interpersonal competence questionnaire, empathy, borderline personality disorder, emotional awareness scale","Borderline personality disorder (BPD), the most common type of personality disorder encountered in clinical practice, manifests in impairment of social interactions and interpersonal relationships. Past insecure attachments may cause interpersonal relationships to break down and negative interpretations to develop, which in turn may lead to more severe conflicts. The aim of the present study is to assess the factors of depression, empathy, and emotional awareness that affect interpersonal intimacy in patients with BPD as compared to controls, and to explore whether different patterns of factors cause the impairments of interpersonal intimacy in patients with BPD. Thirty patients diagnosed with BPD by psychiatrists and thirty healthy subjects in the comparison group participated in the study. Subjects were assessed with the assessment of separation-individual inventory, interpersonal competence questionnaire (ICQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), and levels of emotional awareness scale (LEAS). The ICQ includes five subscales: initiation, negative assertion, disclosure, emotional support, and conflict management. The IRI includes four subscales: perspective taking (PT), fantasy (FS), personal distress (PD), and empathic concern (EC). The results showed that scores on empathy, emotional awareness, depression, and interpersonal intimacy were lower in patients than in controls. Regression analysis showed that lower performance in PT may explain the impairment of interpersonal intimacy in patients with BPD. Thus, our results suggest that strengthening the ability of perspective taking may help to improve the interpersonal relationships of patients with BPD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201412-201501060010-201501060010-123-151,41,2014,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The results of the family structure showed that the participants paid a great deal of attention to their family members. In order to prevent and mediate conflict, they were often deeply involved at the expense of ignoring their own needs. While experiencing heavy psychological burdens pushed them away from home, an emotional tie and caring responsibility pulled them back intermittently. Witnessing violence between parents was extremely painful. In order to avoid repeated failure, the participants developed characters and behavior different from their parents. They also tended to support those who were in the disadvantaged group. On one hand, they were pushed to be independent from an early age. However, on the other hand, they still had a need to rely on and have intimacy with others. However, they could only keep a shallow relationship with others due to a lack of trust with others.

By the translation and back translation method and expert validity check, the authors translated and modified the Group Therapy Alliance Scale (GTAS) originally developed by Marziali, Munroe-Blum, and McCleary (1997). There are 36 items in this original scale. Through a pilot study with 274 samples, only 32 items would be used in the formal scale after a factor analysis. A total of 318 participants were involved in this study to evaluate their attitude toward the group counseling working alliance. The results revealed that the Cronbach's α of the GCWAS was.95. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the fitting indices for this scale and validity was evaluated by the convergent validity and discriminant validity. A significant correlation was found between GCWAS and group climate. In addition, a significant correlation was found between GCWAS and the positive feeling for the group. The correlation between GCWAS and cohesion was .73. The correlation between GCWAS and engagement, avoidance, and conflict was .58, .18, and -.27 respectively. In general, GCWAS has sound psychometric property regarding its reliability and validity. Moreover, these results identified that the three domains in the Content Dimension are (a) Goal, (b) Task, and (c) Bond; the four domains in the Interpersonal Dimension are (a) Member and Group Leader, (b) Other Members and Group Leader, (c) Member and Other Members, and (d) Group and Group Leader relationships.

Existing research has supported PDPD's short term effect of reducing negative emotions and long term effect of promoting psychological wellbeing. Although there have been some qualitative studies that examine the psychological properties corresponding to each writing phases in great detail, reliable quantitative indices have not been proposed.

The profession development issue of school psychologist in Taiwan was highly necessary to investigate. For the purposes to explore the difficulties, coping strategies, and profession expectations of the psychologists who served in the school system, ten clinical or counseling psychologists, who had more than two years of experiences, were interviewed. The results indicated four categories of difficulties and coping: (a) the operation of administration and case management, (b) indistinct position in professional service, (c) division and collaboration in the system, and (d) the family intervention and resource linkage The three types of expectations of further professional service were reflection of practice and training, evaluation of the service model, and the prospect on system building of school guidance. Discussion were integrated from the results, which focus on the two dimensions of practice essence and service model. First, the ”mobile psychological service” of responsible region could be an appropriate service model for school psychologists to provide interventions. Second, at the direct service level of professional practice, student interventions should expend and enhance their depth.

The participants were 41 adults who worked over 40 hours per week and lived with their children under 18 years old. Participants' age ranged from 28 to 55 (M = 38.4 years; SD = 6.81 years). Data were collected from nine focus groups and were analyzed using the grounded theory. The results were divided into experience of work-family conflict and experience of work-family enrichment. The experience of work-family conflict was induced into background, conflict experience, and coping strategies. The background consisted of job type and system, family structure, the influence of society and culture, and the resources system. The conflict experience was divided into work to family conflict experience and family to work conflict experience. The former included the conflict in the external family and the conflict within the inner self, whereas the latter was comprised of the conflicts of work involvement and performance, the conflict of career development, and the conflict within the inner self. The coping strategies were skills/abilities and cognitive adaptation. The experience of work-family enrichment entered into work-family enrichment, family-work enrichment, work experience enrichment for the self and family experience enrichment for the self. Both work-family enrichment and family-work enrichment were related to resources/benefits, and spiritual meaning. The work experience enrichment for the self included enhancing the sense of achievement, self-esteem, confidence, self-growth and the connection to society. The family experience enrichment for the self included the balance being maintained in life, and providing a more fulfilling life.

Eighteen elementary school counselors, 6 males and 12 females, age 26-45, with an average of 7.9 years of professional experiences, were invited to participate in two focus groups. The groups focused on the difficulties the participants had encountered in their practices and their expectations of the larger school system and of their profession. The reliability of rating consistency of the meaning units and thematic categories by the raters was .89. Seven thematic categories emerged from the data analysis and were the basis of the present paper. The results showed participants' difficulties at two fronts: at the personal-professional front and at the system front. The reported difficulties included a lack of self confidence, professional role ambiguity, demand to offer responsive service of individual and group counseling, and critical need to engage in system-wide interventions involving parents and teachers. At the system level, the difficulties were reflected in the structure of the guidance and administrative systems, the profession role, duty and policy for school counselors, and the deficiency in supporting resources and infrastructure. On the other hand, the participants expressed expectations for professional development to include continuous training and supervision and enhancement in resources and team building from administration or the larger system.

A Pilot Study of the Stroop Interference Effects on Death-related Words among Undergraduate Students,Ming-Chang Tsai,"death anxiety, interference effects, death, Stroop task","Self-reported scale is the most commonly used measure of death anxiety. However, the validity of self-reported scale rests on the presumption of honesty on the part of the respondents. For most people, death carries a certain degree of threat. Consequently, even if the respondents do not intent to be deceptive, their responses are unconsciously influenced by defense mechanism, positive illusion, and/or social expectation. In view of the above, the presented pilot study attempts to adopt the research paradigm based on emotional Stroop task, which distinguishes itself from a self-report scale. Through interviewing 10 undergraduate students, the investigator of the study formulated the structure of a death-related words Stroop task. The task was further developed based on death-related terms provided by another 50 undergraduate students. Later, 106 undergraduate students participated in the test of the Stroop task. The results of the pilot study revealed that the death-related terms influenced the interference effect of the participants, but the effect did not correlate with the participants' score on the self-reported scale. In addition, the pattern of gender difference on the Stroop task was in direct oppose of that based on the self-reported scale.

Development and Validation of a Supervisory Relationship Scale,Sophie Woo,"supervisory relationship, supervisee, developing inventory, supervision","The purpose of this study was to develop a valid and reliable measure of supervisory relationship from the perspective of supervisees. Qualitative data obtained from a previous study and information generated from a review of the literature were used to construct a 78 item self-report questionnaire measure. After an evaluation by six professionals who used a constructive model to analyze the content validity of the scale, 4 items were combined into 2 and 24 items with CVI lower than .80 were deleted, resulting in a 52-item original version of Supervisory Relationship Scale (SRS). The scale was administered to 198 counseling supervisees with diverse background characteristics on gender, training level, affiliated universities, institutions, and geographical areas. The principal components analysis identified seven components for the construct of SRS. Due to having only one single item, the seventh component was removed. Finally the SRS was comprised of six components and 51 items in total. The components were labeled: ”Safe Supervisory Environment and Personal Characteristics”, ”Trustworthy Supervision and Professional Traits”, ”Supervision Intervention Facilitating Cognitive Development”, ”Formative Feedback and Role Modeling”, ”Helping Awareness and Situated Intervening”, and ”Supervisor Self Disclosure” . The amount of variance in SRS explained by the six factors was 61.715%. The results of the analyses for the scale's concurrent validity, internal consistency and split-half reliability were favorable. The SRS demonstrated good concurrent validity (γ=.871, p＜.001), high internal consistency (α=.978), and good split­half reliability (γxx=.959).

Specifically, management of suicide/self-injury crises is one of the most common occurrences faced by university-based counselors. In responding to the increasing suicide/self-injury incidences across campuses, the Ministry of Education in Taiwan stipulated a student depression and suicide/self-injury prevention and management flowchart based on the tertiary prevention concept. By studying the experiences of four university counseling centers in Northern Taiwan, this study explored the obstacles faced and the solutions adopted by each of these universities in managing crises. It is hoped that this study can help supplement the crisis management procedures formulated by the Ministry of Education and that the unique culture of the various universities can be incorporated into the emergency management procedures to help each campus responding to crises. The present study analyzed case files as well as conducted focus groups to collect information related to obstacles encountered during crisis and the corresponding management strategies used in each of the campuses. The specific elements of assessment, referral, liaison, reporting, meeting, and follow-up counseling indicated in the emergency case management model were examined. Results of the study suggest that difficulties in carrying out assessment, referral and medical treatment were found across campuses and each university has developed its own unique responding strategies. Approaches to liaison and reporting were found to be divergent across campuses due to differences in the administrative culture of each university. On the basis of the above results, the current study forwards a modified version of the suicide/self-injury crisis management reference flowchart to help address concerns across campuses.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201312-201405140003-201405140003-149-182,38,2013,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

However, less research has focused on experiences of Taiwanese mother's caring for an adolescent or adult with autism. A sample of 60 adolescents and adults (mean age = 16.8 years, age ranged from 10 to 31 years) with autistic disorder and their mothers in Taiwan were recruited for this study. To investigate the mother-child relationship and its underlying causes, the participants' co-residing mothers were asked to complete a self-report questionnaire about mother and child interactions and the factors related to mother and child relationships. The results showed that children's feeling of trust toward their mothers and mothers' affection for children played an important role in mother-child relationships. The quality of mother-child relationships was also significantly correlated with age and functional independence of individuals with autism. Additionally, results demonstrated that mothers' emotional status, worry about their child, levels of depression, and burden from being a caregiver were negatively associated with the quality of mother-child relationships. The findings indicated factors that may influence mother-child relationships, and also highlighted the association between the quality of parent-child relationship and mother's well-being.

This study first reviewed and summarized the perspectives that counseling and psychotherapy have had about the suffering of humans. It was discovered that (a) both conventional counseling and psychotherapy theories have conceptualized the mind as a substance of closure and independent of the outer world. They also assumed the suffering has been resulted from humans' not capable of adapting to the outer world; and (b) postmodern theories tent to regard the reality as a product of individual or social construction, and the suppression of the mainstream culture is a head of stream for humans' suffering. By discovering the discrepancy of the above mentioned orientations in modern and post-modern theories, this study aimed to realize human suffering from view of existential phenomenology. And it can be the based phenomenon to bridge up the discrepancies from different theoretical orientations. This study conducted textual analysis on the suffering of three respondents by using the methodology of existential phenomenology. It was found that the suffering of the respondents resulted from the denial of their existed situations and the disappointment toward the expected ones. Being on the breaking points of both the existed situation and the expected one made the respondents suffer from the feeling of losing the grounds of life ahead.

Thirteen participants (13-29 years; 11 females, 3 males) were interviewed to gather data on their past ignoring experiences. According the model, Chinese people who place importance on the relationship can not easily confront it but rather let the conflict become implicit. Instead of damaging the relationship directly, ignoring the target is one way of coping with interpersonal conflict. Ignoring passes on an unsatisfied feeling silently. The results showed that the ignoring process was a practice of how to balance the I-Thou psychological distance. If there was a chance to communicate clearly and express each other's value in the relationship, the resulting relationship entered into genuine harmony. Even after the contact between friends ceased to exist, these people did not easily accept or become aware of the end of the relationship. Findings of the study suggest that the results after ignoring are not all negative.

To conduct the literature review, psychodrama articles published in Taiwan were retrieved by database searching and personal acquisition. Retrieved articles were subsequently organized by publication dates and extracted for information, including article contents, study subjects, areas of application, and themes for application. Based on the extracted information for content analysis and article categorization, the researcher concluded that: (1) Theoretical Explanation, Practical Application and Academic Research constituted the three major categories of the Taiwanese psychodrama literature, and two thirds of all articles fell within the category of Practical Application, which was dominated by Personal Sharing. (2) Early psychodrama literature in Taiwan provided mostly Introduction to Basic Theory, but it later became more popular to write about Personal Sharing, Journal Articles, Applications of Psychodrama Concepts, Exploration of Techniques, Theoretical Interpretation and Combination of Approaches; however in recent years, an increase in master’s theses and doctorate dissertations was observed. (3) Applications of Psychodrama were found in five major arenas in Taiwan, developed in the chronological order of hospitals, campuses, communities, industries and the legal system.

"From ""Authoritarian-Regard"" to ""Self-Regard"": Exploring Taiwanese Play Therapists' Transitions of Parenting Conceptions from Multicultural Perspectives","Hsien-Huei Chiou, Ping-Hwa Chen, Meei-Shiuan Lih","play therapist, parenting conception, authoritarian-regard, grounded theory, multicultural counseling","Authoritarian/compliance is an important ingredient of traditional Chinese parenting, so Taiwanese play therapists might own lots of experiences of ”authoritarian-regard”. However, the rationale of play therapy focused on ”self-regard” characters. So, how Taiwanese play therapists identify a set of parenting conceptions is the focus of this study. From the cultural perspective, the present research, following the constructivism paradigm, collected and analyzed data based on grounded theory. Nine Taiwanese play therapists were recruited to be interviewees for semi-structured interviews. The results showed a transition for the interviewees that although the interviewees all experienced different levels of ”authoritarian regard” parenting when they were young, they all consistently opposed to authoritarian parenting. This transition happened when interviewees gradually grew up and got the ”corrected experiences” purposely or by chance from the interactions of grandparents, couples, teachers, siblings, professional peers, or therapists. These corrected experiences were different from ”authoritarian-regard” and increased their autonomy. Interviewees all tried to incorporate this new experience in the interactions with their own parents and children. Not every interviewee successfully modified their own authoritarian interactions because different interviewees owned different internal and external resources. Basically, if interviewees can change their parent-child interactions, then this transition would likely reinforce the disagreement with authoritarian parenting. Suggestions based on the finding of this study were highlighted that it is better for Taiwanese play therapists to culturally coordinate their life experiences and therapeutic rationales concerned to practice.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201308-201309140008-201309140008-117-153,36,2013,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

This study used a cross-sectional design and purposive sampling. We modified the questionnaire CAGE for the survey of alcoholism. Data were collected from 493 aborigines who had drinking behavior in aboriginal communities. Data were analyzed based on fundamental characteristics, health status, and habits. The results showed that there were significant difference in occurrence of alcoholism among factors such as ethnic groups, gender, age, education level and marriage. Alcoholism occurred more frequently among individuals who were male, younger, with lower education level and unmarried. Individuals with better health status were less likely to become alcoholics. There are several habitual factors that affected the development of alcoholism. Factors that were associated with alcoholism included smoking, chewing betel nut, starting to drink in younger age, having drinking buddies, day-time drinker, drinking in a great amount of alcohol, having certain kinds of alcohol-containing drink, and realizing the bad effects of drinking. Among the risk factors that affected the person’s alcoholism, self-conscious health condition, smoking, the amount of drinking, and drinking time during the day were critical elements. Because alcoholics showed significant difference to nonalcoholic ones distinguished by fundamental characteristics, habitual factors and health status, this study recommended that attention should be paid to the drinking time during a day, the quantity of drinking and self-control capability to effectively reduce the ratio of alcoholics in an aboriginal community with drinking culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201308-201309140008-201309140008-155-182,36,2013,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

In addition, the adolescents’ behavioral changes do not show up immediately. Taken together, this makes the evaluation rather challenging. The purpose of this study was to build performance indicators for the outreach work. A focus group with 19 outreach workers was formed. The results suggest several recommendations for future practice. First, the government should develop good indicators of guidance performance based on different strategies of outreach work.

The Influence of Income on Marital Power and Marital Violence,"Lien-Chien Yang, Hsiu-Chu Tung","schizophrenia, income, mental illness, marital power, marital conflict, marital violence","This study explores the influence of spousal income on marital violence and marital power. Seventy couples with husband-to-wife aggression were recruited from a psychiatric center and were divided into three groups based on spousal income: (a) husbands higher in income (n = 25), (b) equal in income (n = 20), and (c) wives higher in income (n = 25). The authors tracked participant's marital conflicts which occurred before the first violent episode, and measured couple's marital power by the Marital Power Clinical Rating Scale, consisting of matter, affection, and resources subscales. Results supported the hypothesis that, among three components of marital power, spousal income positively correlated with resources power the most, yet correlated with affection power the least. The results also revealed that: (a) couples with wives higher in income suffered severer marital violence, especially when the couples were poor or the husbands had mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, anxiety disorder); (b) the more the wife's income, the greater the marital power, but only the resources power positively correlated with her income; (c) couples with husbands higher in income were husband-dominant in all the three marital power dimensions, yet couples with wives higher in income were wife-dominant in none of the marital power dimensions; (d) couples with equal in income were the most egalitarian ones; (e) no matter how high the wife's income was, her husband had greater affection power. The clinical implications were discussed in four areas: (a) help couples deal with the changes in marital power structure; (b) help couples confront their problems and mend their marital relations; (c) develop wives' relational power, and teach husbands to obtain relational power; and (d) help couples coconstruct egalitarian relations in a conscious manner.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201304-201309160003-201309160003-121-146,35,2013,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The scale can help educators evaluate college students' interpersonal frustration tolerance. The pretest sample consisted of 321 college students. All items were screened via item analysis. Later, using purposive sampling method, a sample of 1,800 participants was collected from 11 colleges in central Taiwan. The sample was randomly divided into three sets. The first set was used to generate the factors through exploratory factor analysis. Three factors were extracted from the scale: action approach, interpersonal risk, and emotional feeling. The Cronbach's coefficient alpha for the entire scale was .88, and the alphas of three subscales ranged from .75 to .83. The second set was used for confirmatory factor analysis to examine the fit of the overall model and its internal structure. The third set was used for cross-validation. The study found that the developed new scale had a good model-data fit along with good reliability, construct validity, criterion-related validity, and stability based on cross-validation.

Why are the characters of Eileen Chang devoting themselves to something that seems hopeless? The motifs of works do not appear out of thin air; instead, they are often highly related to the writer's own life course. This research provided answers to the mystery of creation, and revealed the life of Eileen Chang's early years with her parents (especially the mother) which were full of love-hate ambivalence. It also showed how the ambivalent feelings brought about disturbances and spiritual pain, and how Eileen Chang developed the detached personality described in Horney's psychoanalytic theory.

The experiential structure of spontaneity in psychodrama consisted of two dimensions of behaviors. One was the vertical dimension, indicating the words-bodily feelings connection, and the other was the horizontal dimension, indicating the interpersonal verbal and nonverbal communication. Through the scene-setting, playing the role, or interacting with the protagonist, the auxiliaries in psychodrama came to experience psychological or bodily feelings and they might also feel urgent to speak out the experience in interpersonal realms.

The study surveyed 1,501 students from senior or vocational high schools in Tainan City and County, Taiwan. The instruments used in this study included: (a) the Family System Differentiation Scale, (b) the Self-Concept Scale, and (c) the Interpersonal Interaction Scale. In terms of direct prediction effects, the results showed that: (a) Other than forbearance, mother-son, father-son and marital sub-system differentiation all effectively predicted the ”competition”, ”evasion” and ”coordination” strategies, although their influence varied. (b) The better the differentiation of respective sub-systems, the more likely the rational ”coordination” strategy was to be taken. Conversely, emotional ”competition” and ”evasion” strategies also tended to be taken. It is particularly noteworthy that marital sub-system differentiation was predictive of all emotional strategies. The influence of father-son differentiation outperformed that of mother-son differentiation in regard to employing a rational strategy, but the reverse was true for emotional strategies. In terms of the mediational effects of self-concept, it was found that: (a) with the competition strategy, the ”individual self” had no mediational effect, whereas the ”rational self” showed a strong mediational effect; (b) With the evasion strategy, the ”individual self” had some mediational effect, while the ”rational self” presented a strong mediational effect; (c) with the coordination strategy, the ”individual self” and ”rational self” only had a limited mediating effect; (d) With the ”forbearance” strategy, the ”individual self” and ”rational self” did not have a mediational effect. Furthermore, as a whole, the mediational effect of ”rational self” was greater than that of ”individual self”, and its influence mechanism was mainly applied to the emotional strategy.

The result showed that career resilience in unemployment experiences could bedivided into four categories-environmental risk factors, individual risk factors, environmental protective factors, and personal protective factors. Furthermore this study defined personal protective factors as ”career resiliency” (Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000), and career resiliency of unemployed participants consists of ”cushioning” at the initial stage of unemployment, ”persistency” in the middle of unemployment, and ”transformability” in the late stage. The Cushioning factor includes unemployment expectations, job-transfer preparation, positive emotional adjustment, and sense of control. The Persistency factor includes arrangements for life and vitality, positive self-esteem and positive values and beliefs. The Transformability factor includes the ability of to assess reality and career strategies, transformation of frames, the ability to reconstruct meanings, development of skills, and adaptation to new work environments.

The Transforming Process of the Narrative Counselor After Practicing the Concepts of Narrative Counseling,"Chi-Fang Chang, Shuh-Ren Jin","counselor development, life experiences, narrative counseling, transforming process","The purpose of this study aimed at understanding the transforming process of the narrative counselor after practicing the narrative concepts. The study adopts the holistic-content method of narrative research. The researcher had interviewed three narrative counselors. By analyzing their stories, the researcher looks into the effects that the narrative counseling has on them, and tries to understand how they interpret and re-narrative those changes happening to them. Several findings are as follows: (1) The transforming process of the narrative counselor after practicing the narrative concepts is similar to our writing of the letter ”V”: This process starts from the counselor's ”learning from the outside”, then gradually he/she turns inwards to personal life experience, finally he/she merges the two to create a new way to interact with the world. The transformation contents are as follows: (a)The change from a ”counselor” to a ”complete person”. (b)The change from ”learning from theory” to ”learning from people”. (c)The transformation of the counselor's role and attitude. (d)The construction process of the positive self-identity. (e)The development of ”personal identity” and its extension as ”professional identity”. (f)The witness provided by the feedback from important others and client can help sustain the re-writing process of one's own story. (g)The shift of focus from skills to values and the development of new skills based on these values. (2)The interpretation and re-narrating of a narrative counselor's transforming process by him/herself can be divided into three layers: (a) to prove the already known, (b) to discover the unknown, and (c) pointing to the future.

After Sexual Harassment: Secondary Harm from Women Coping with Sexual Harassment Incident,Tsun-Yin Luo,"silencing process, sexual harassment, secondary harm, patriarchy, disclosure anxiety, institutional abuse, social isolation","While most sexual harassment literature in Taiwan focus on the primary impacts of sexual harassment incident, this study examines nine women survivors' secondary harm resulting from coping with sexual harassment. This study found that survivors experienced various types of sexual harassment and engaged in various coping styles. Nevertheless, due to the patriarchal culture, their coping of sexual harassment often resulted into secondary harms, such as disclosure anxiety, self-blame for confusion, backlash from confronting the harasser, institutional abuse in the complaint process, as well as destruction and isolation in social relationship. Although the main findings support radical feminist contention of sexual harassment as patriarchal oppression on women, this paper also noticed that women's discourse on the secondary harm from sexual harassment reveals their resentment with and resistance to sexism in Taiwan, which might represent a possible subversion to patriarchal oppression.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201208-201212250039-201212250039-155-191,33,2012,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

For meeting the sample size requirement of multilevel analysis, an integrated data set was drawn from three independent studies resulting in a total of 82 groups and 744 members. Results from item analysis show that the sixth and the eighth items of the GCQ-S performed poorly with non-significant factor loadings and small amount of variance explained. Results from the multilevel CFA after excluding the sixth and eighth items indicated that MacKenzie's three-factor theory was supported both at the individual level and at the group level. Specifically, while constraining individual level data to be three correlated factors, group level data could be modeled by either three correlated factors or two correlated factors. Though both models provided satisfactory model fit, the three-three-factor model was superior to the three-two-factor model. This study was among the very few empirical studies that support MacKenzie's theory of group climate.

The data was analyzed using the holistic-content of the narrative methodology, focusing on three dimensions: time, location, and people and society. This study interpreted the experiences of a mother who had a son and had previous experience in foster family services. When a foster child was placed into a family with an only child, not only does the whole family system change, but the original relation variables were also expanded. The researcher started by clarifying the system members' roles and interacting conditions before deciding to become a foster family, which in turn would serve as the starting point to understanding the subsystem of the biological mother and child. Then the impact of the subsystem of biological mother-son was analyzed, including the six stages: ”the besieging plight,” ”the expanding, starting wind,” ”sailing in huge waves,” ”the subsequent storms and breakers,” ”disillusioned from the storm,” and ”sailing to one's own.” Seven themes were obtained: ”bondage and attachment,” ”worry and rejoice,” ”life battlefield with frequent shocks,” ”jostling for love and resources,” ”tangled and struggling emotions,” ”restoring the lost trust,” and ”reconstructing parent-child relationship.” The mutual influences and changes between parent and child are also induced.

However, the factors that affect parenting styles have not been well researched in these studies, and studies that focus on the preschool stage are particularly rare. Therefore, this study collected data from 986 parents whose children were in kindergartens in Hualien County/City, Taiwan during 2008. A path model was tested on factors hypothesized to affect parenting styles of preschool children's parents. Parenting value was included in the model as the mediator in the relations of socio-economic backgrounds and experience of being disciplined in early childhood to parenting styles. We also explored if parenting styles were affected by socialization and intergenerational transmission. Major findings are as follows: (1) Most of the parents adopted the ”enlightened” style to discipline their children, but the ”authoritarian and punitive” style was also commonly used. Compared with their own parents, these parents adopted the ”enlightened” style more frequently than the ”authoritarian and punitive” style. (2) Parenting styles had less significant difference among socio-economic background variables. (3) The experience of being disciplined in early childhood and parents' parenting value were associated with their current parenting styles. (4) The difference in parenting styles among parents with different experience of being disciplined in early childhood could partly be attributed to their parenting value. The above results suggest that parenting styles of preschool children's parents are significantly affected by socialization and intergenerational transmission.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201204-201204160002-201204160002-121-147,32,2012,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Participants were 159 parents of high school students from a senior high school and a vocational high school in Taipei City, Taiwan. Research tools included the Supportive Sex Communication Scale, Sexual Communication Topic Questionnaire, Parental Beliefs about Family Sex Communication Scale, and General Sex Communication Attitude Scale. An exploratory factor analysis of the sexual communication topics generated three factors: General sex topics, Specific sex topics, and Taboo sex topics. General sex topics obtained the highest communication frequency mean score and the Taboo sex topics obtained the lowest. Multiple regression analyses controlling for demographic variables indicated that the three sex topics differed in predictor variables. Supportive communication was positively related to communication frequencies on General sex topic and Specific sex topics. The less expectation parents held for their talks, the more frequently they talked about General sex topics. However, none of the predictor variables significantly predicted communication frequencies on Taboo sex topics. Furthermore, ANCOVA and chi-square analyses showed that supportive parents were characterized as being more open and honest, having more trust toward their children, having more respect for their children's opinions, and having less expectation for effects of their talks. They also had higher satisfactory scores on parent-child sex communication.

Results revealed that both individual- and relationship-oriented intrinsic and extrinsic work values are relative stable. The following work values were relatively unstable stable: security and safety, autonomy and flexibility, balance between work and life. In comparison with the responses ten years ago, workers now valued more on intrinsic challenge and growth, extrinsic reward, stability and security of work and less concerned about power, status and leadership, which might reflect the influences of economic recession and societal change. The relationship between beliefs in parenthood and work values measured ten years later suggests that female workers' beliefs in parenthood are still in conflict with their individual-oriented intrinsic and extrinsic work values. Male workers' beliefs in parenthood may strengthen their work values.

Data were collected from five experienced counselors via in-depth interview and interpersonal process recall (IPR) interview; that is, the experiences include memory of the past and current counseling experiences.The results are as follows. In contents, the seasoned counselors' experiences of discrepancy between their intentions and actions were ”feelings of getting stuck” and ”hoping to be better”. In properties, the experiences of discrepancy were cracks rather than unrecoverable errors. The contributing factors of discrepancy were the counselors' idiographic verbal expressions, the lack of confidence, quick temper, inappropriate rationale, negligence of counseling situations, and the lack of motivation of client. The three channels in which counselors discovered the experiences of discrepancy were: self awareness, others' comments, as well as behavior observation and evaluation. As soon as counselors became aware of the discrepancy, they started the process of coping. The strategies of coping were ”introspection, assessment, and hypothesis testing”, ”positive regard for discrepancy”, and ”in pursuit of excellence”. When coped successfully, they became skilled and matured experts. And, the discrepancy always became the impetus to change in counseling process.Both intention and action were important predictors of counseling outcomes. The experiences of discrepancy were filled with powerful action because corrective process started immediately as soon as counselors acknowledged the discrepancy.

"Cultural Contexts and Spiritual Issues in Family Therapy: Predicaments, Change and Reflections from a Domestic Violence Family",Hong-Ying Chia,"family therapy, cultural contexts, domestic violence, spirituality","This paper explores the cultural contexts and spiritual issues in family therapy, with a special focus on a case of domestic violence. The process of family therapy was videotaped and analyzed through discourse analysis. Results revealed the family's predicaments, such as the battered woman's fear and helplessness in the face of violence, the abused child, spousal abuse and sibling relationships controlled by the father's violence. These conditions indicate that domestic violence has become normalized by patriarchal culture, social prejudice towards single mothers, religious norms on marital separation, economic pressure on single mothers, poverty and crime-related violence. After family therapy, the family has been transformed such as the relationship between the woman and her husband, among the mother, children and the siblings, although the woman still stayed in her marriage, but she knew how to free the violence from her husband. There were different culture values including 'as a mother as a strong woman', 'harmony is very precious' and male chauvinism interweaved in this violent family. This therapeutic change was related to the therapist's deeply understand why the woman didn't want to leave her husband from the cultural contexts, the reflection on cultural differences between the therapist and the battered woman, the fear of the woman to her violent husband, helped the woman de-construct the helpless to her violent husband, and to explore how to protect herself and children without leaving her husband. Church and religion provided important social and spiritual resources to the family; however, these also exerted social pressure on marital obedience through fellowship and spiritual struggles, as dictated by Christian dogma. Using her own Christian identity, the therapist openly discussed biblical teachings about divorce, which reduced the client's anxiety. This resulted in a transformation from a personal religious problem to a form of spiritual healing.

The study adopted the task analysis approach in which participants received six to eight counseling sessions. Participants of this study included ten dual-career women, aged between 28 to 47 years old (M=38.8). The interview transcripts were analyzed qualitatively using discovery-oriented psychotherapy. Based on the analyses, a model containing four theme categories and ten themes were constructed. The strength-centered counseling protocol for dual-career women was then proposed. The four theme categories include Exploration/Assessment, Insight, Change, and Action. The model consists of ten stages: (1)defining the problem; (2)stating the problem, including causes and contexts; (3)exploring, assessing and understanding the content and influences of an individual's life experiences and current roles in life; (4)bringing insights into her intrinsic values and needs, and integrating both positive and negative experiences; (5)perceiving the content of social, culture, and gender experiences; (6)being aware of the conflicts between different roles and coping strategies; (7)knowing, creating and expanding one's own strengths; (8)reframing; (9)creativeness and creating, specifically making plans, practicing exercises, connecting diverse strengths and creating an integrated and balanced prospect; and (10)taking actions.

Factors Influencing Unmarried Battered Women's Decision-Making of Intimate Relationship Development,"Chia-Ling Yang, Shu-Chu Chao","intimate partner violence, unmarried battered females, the influencing factor of decision-making, relationship inertia","For approximately two decades, clinicians and researchers have recognized the presence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in the lives of women in Taiwan. These studies, however, focused primarily on the experience of married women in abusive relationships. On the other hand, the lack of consideration of and attention to unmarried women involved in intimate violent relationships has been noted. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to fill in the gap that explores unmarried women involved in intimate violent relationships. What factors have affected unmarried battered women in their decision-making?
Semi-constructive and in-depth interviews were conducted with four unmarried women. A qualitative research approach was adopted to analyze the data. A variety of factors on the decision to terminate an abusive relationship were identified. Among these factors, relationship inertia and sexual relationship were the most prominent. One worthy note to mention is that unmarried battered women and their partners together constructed many unequal interactive rules, which gradually accumulated into a kind of ”relationship inertia.” This ”relationship inertia” would result in unmarried battered women's lack of courage to change an intimate relationship or to terminate a violent relationship.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201104-201105270006-201105270006-37-70,29,2011,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The study adopted narrative qualitative methodology and snow ball sampling. The participants were three self-identified lesbians (ages 26 to 30) who have worked and come out to at least one family member. The authors selected and presented the three participants' life narratives. The findings suggest that the factors that affect lesbians' coming out process include the motivation, the subject, and the timing of the coming out. The coming out process included three types in accordance with family roles: sibling, mother and father. Lesbians felt at ease and more unburdened when coming out to their sibling. They felt more of a struggle and encumbrance for coming out to their mothers. They are less likely to come out to their fathers because the relationship is more distant and it is more risky to come out to fathers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201104-201105270006-201105270006-71-104,29,2011,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The adolescents' self-esteem and several family and school contextual latent constructs (e.g., satisfaction with the parent-child relationship, school attachment, and relationships with teachers and friends) are factors affecting the developments of adolescents' well-beings.
The participants consisted of 924 junior high school students who had completed repeated measurements over time. The results showed that self-esteem was the most crucial factor on the developments of adolescents' depressive symptoms. While an adolescent's satisfaction with parent-child relationship had little impact on an adolescent's initial status of depressive symptoms, the relationships with teachers and friends significantly influenced the changing path of an adolescent's depressive symptoms. The findings suggest that the impact of family and school contextual factors on the development of an adolescent's depressive symptoms varies over time.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201104-201105270006-201105270006-161-181,29,2011,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Jin (2005) argues that in the first-person pronoun phase, the participants are inclined to self-disclose personal feelings; in the second-person pronoun, their writing consists more of an inner dialogue with an emergence of a supportive and yet critical pattern; and the third-person pronoun phase is generally characterized by objective and rational tones. One hundred participants wrote about their recent negative life experiences three times a week for six weeks. The results showed that contents written in the first-person pronoun had the most negative and least positive emotions and highest word count. The second-person pronoun received the highest scores on caring and criticism, and the third-person pronoun the highest scores on event understanding.

There had not been any empirical studies that analyzed the issues on the relationships and types of internal factors of afterlife beliefs in Taiwan. The conclusions of this study were as follows:
1. In the dimension of affirmance, the undergraduate could be divided into ”the believer”, ”the rejecter” and ”the doubter”.
2. There were three belief types among undergraduate about the rules of the afterlife, including ”the slight believer in causality”, ”the rejecter in causality” and ”the firm believer in causality”.
3. The undergraduates could be divided into three types in the dimension of circumstance, including ”the believer in energy transformation”, ”the slight believer in reincarnation” and ”the slight believer in reincarnation”.
4. There were significant two-way correlations among the three dimensions of afterlife beliefs; the interaction of two dimensions would not be influenced by the third dimension.

The impact of training on a group leader's self-efficacy, intentions and focuses, and skills were examined in this study.
Participants consisted of 8 trainees and 34 members who were volunteers in the study. Trainees were doctorate students and members were from communities. Each pair of trainees co-led a ten-week long unstructured group, during which time they received training and live supervision based on this training model. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods were applied for data collecting and analysis. Trainees demonstrated significant higher scores in post-test than pre-test of Group Leader Self-Efficacy Instrument (GLSI). Between pre and post training, focuses and intentions and skills were significantly different both in amount and distribution of frequencies. After training, the leaders appeared more active and mature in their leadership than before. In addition, members of four groups reached an average score of 5.07 on Involvement Subscale of The Group Climate Questionnaire-Short (GCQ-S), and the scores shape a curved line that matches the theoretical development of a group process and previous research findings.

In the education system in Taiwan, a student and his advisor teacher build close ties in which the student is subject to the advisor teacher's watchful discipline. The purpose of this research is to explore the effects that the advisor teacher has on the ego identity of the unruly students and other characteristics that may come from this relationship. Special attention will be on a student's role within the context of an advisor teacher's disciplining situation. The information gathered in this situational context will reveal how an advisor teacher's discipline can shape the growth of a student's unconscious ego identity.
The subjects consist of 14 constantly unruly junior high school students and 17 advisor teachers, most in dyads. This research will be in line with a psychosocial approach based on a symbolic interactionism, adapting a semi-structured interview method and an analysis with grounded theory.
The research found that the effects of an advisor teacher conform to the phenomenon of ”effect of looking through convex lens image in discipline.” Though the disciplined students perceived themselves as the opposite of an ideal type of student, the students internalized the inner judgment of themselves from their advisor teachers. The characteristic of ego identity that is subject to the effects of an advisor teacher is the self-limited identity called ”self-devalued commitment.” The students do recognize and accept their own unruly behavior, which has the characteristic of carrying forward and not discontinuing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201009-201101220005-201101220005-229-281,28,2010,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Parents completed the Parental Test Attitudes Scale and the Parental Test Anxiety Scale; Adolescents completed the Exam Preparation Anxiety Scale and the Learning Passivity Scale. The findings suggested that the Parental Test Attitudes Scale included two factors, emphasis on academic score and tendency to social comparison, and the Parental Test Anxiety Scale included one factor, parental test anxiety; the Parental Test Attitudes Scale and the Parental Test Anxiety Scale demonstrated good reliability estimates. In terms of validity of the scales, the Parental Test Attitudes Scale and the Parental Test Anxiety Scale were significantly correlated to their adolescents’ pretest emotionality, but they were not significantly correlated to pretest worry and learning passivity. Furthermore, the fitness between the ”Parental Test Attitude and Parental Test Anxiety Model” and observed data was satisfactory. Implications for educational guidance and future studies were discussed accordingly.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-201003-201003310008-201003310008-285-328,27,2010,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
Exploration and Analysis of Therapeutic Predicaments of Play Therapists,"Shu-Chen Kao, Chiun-Ruei Tsai","play therapist, therapeutic predicament, play therapy, supervision","Play therapy is the current dominant model in working with child-clients. However, resources for training and supervision are not sufficient to meet the needs in continuing education of play therapists. Play therapy is a specialty which requires special trainings. The researcher believes that proper continuing education can be provided only through accurate understandings of play therapists' work difficulties. Reflecting this viewpoint, this study focuses on investigating and exploring the difficulties in play therapists' experiences. The research data was gathered by qualitative methods through interviewing with 17 play therapists and analyzing the interview transcripts.
Results show that play therapists reported fourteen factors belonging to five main themes of therapeutic predicaments. They are unsureness and difficulties of techniques, anxiety issues of the play therapist, challenges from clients, difficulties of case conceptualization, unsureness of assessment, pressure from expected effectiveness, disturbances from clients' families, pressure from work environment, lack of supervision resource, desire of promoting professional abilities, expectation of an ideal supervisor, positive effects on the child, sense of achievement and motivation, and ways to resolve predicaments. The five main themes include difficulties in the play therapy process, unsureness of effectiveness of play therapy, pressure and conflict from the working context, unmeet supervision needs, and self-adapting to the difficulties.
According to the findings, it is evident that play therapists confront various challenges in their clinical work. Based on the results, meaning of the findings and continuing education and supervision concerns for the play therapists are discussed. Suggestions for play therapy educators and practitioners as well as for further research are given.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-200909-200912020033-200912020033-1-45,26,2009,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

A Study of Antisocial Pattern of ADHD Children With/Without Conduct Problems,"Yi-Hsuan Wu, Yu-Hwa Lin","morality, cruelty to animals, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, aggression, conduct problems","The observed behaviors in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and ADHD with conduct problems (CP) are rather similar. Both of them present antisocial behaviors such as aggression and disobedience. Therefore it's difficult to make discriminate diagnoses among children with aggressive behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences of antisocial patterns between ADHD children with/without CP. After reviewing related researches, three traits had been selected in this study: aggression, morality and cruelty to animals.
The subjects were recruited from hospitals and special education system of elementary schools in metropolitan Taipei area. Twenty-five children (mean age=8.82) were included in ADHD-only group and twenty-two children (mean age=8.88) were included in ADHD+CP group. All the subjects were given a projective test ”Tell Me A Story” to assess aggression and morality, and the ”Children and Animals Inventory” was administered to assess the subjects' behaviors of cruelty to animals.
The results of the present study revealed that ADHD-only group and ADHD+CP group showed significant differences in aggression (p＜.05), morality (p＜.001), and cruelty to animals (p＜.01). This study proved that ”aggression”, ”morality”, and ”cruelty to animals” are good discriminating indicators for ADHD children with/without CP. These findings also bear potentially important implications for the distinctive psychological etiology of the ADHD children with conduct problems. Limitations are discussed and recommendations are made for future research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-200909-200912020033-200912020033-121-162,26,2009,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The study recruited seven volunteer participants by email and the Internet message board and picked one of them after evaluation and counseling. From this selected participant five types of data were gathered. They are twenty-one word-for-word online counseling records, fifty emails, two certificates, three photographs, and an online story. During the research I analyzed the counseling dialog in terms of the overall content, and a method of narrative analysis.
The master of the story considered that the inquiries in the narrative therapy helped her contemplate the meaning from an objective point of view by distinguishing herself from the ”problems”. Meanwhile, she was able to reconstruct this story teemed with problems through the special meaning of the branch story. In addition, the application of therapeutic documents, including e-mails, certificates, photos and online articles could also be reviewed again and again by the master of the story and she could record thread of thoughts in the process.

Thirteen high school students participated in this research. Ten out of them performed solution behavior, and three did not. A coding system was constructed with open coding to code the counseling transcripts. The initial behavior of the clients in this research was characterized by low achievement task value expressed either orally or in writing. The issues in the initial stage were as follows: (1) clients felt helpless toward English; (2) clients need to be committed to change; (3) clients need to re-attribute school failure from outside reason to inside reason; (4) finally, clients get insights to understand the influence of their low achievement value on their learning motivation. The issues in the middle counseling stage included: (1) clients explore their successful experience to regain enthusiasm to deal with their school achievement task again; (2) clients' resistance was used as a subject to discuss possible difficulties, and counselors could provide guidance for clients to develop self-regulated learning strategies; (3) clients then could develop better self-efficacy and they believed the cost of doing well in English was not high. Then, their achievement task value was raised. The issues in the final stage were: (1) clients would declare their future career or life goals; (2) clients might reevaluate the importance and utilities of English task value and agreed that both values were raised. The resulting behaviors of this research were identified by the elevation of students' achievement task value and learning motivation and the presentation of self-directed learning behaviors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-200903-x-25-81-130-a,25,2009,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Participants were asked to remember as accurately as possible the events which led to their decision to marry and explain why each event resulted in increasing or decreasing of commitment. Researchers read each transcript and generated four categories of subjective inferences. Intrapersonal factors were explanations in which the partner and the relationship are evaluated against some personal standards. Dyadic factors included behavior and subjective interdependence, conflict, self-disclosure, and redefinitions of the stage of involvement. Social network factors made references to interaction with or attributions about third parties such as relatives, friends, and other dating partners. Circumstantial factors were anticipated or unanticipated events over which the person had little or no control, and which stemmed from institutions or forces external to the person or their relationships.

We also propose that phenomenological method that uses descriptions of experiences as its target of analysis, is not only conducting the reduction and description of experienced objects, but also disclosing the situational structure of existential contexts. The steps of carrying out phenomenological analysis are presented and modified, with the help of an example from learning experience.

Two hundred and fifty two participants had completed the ”Afterlife belief and attitudes toward life” questionnaire. The response rate was 84%. The conclusions of this study were as follows：
1. The belief in afterlife of the undergraduates in Taiwan was hesitant. They had a higher tendency to accept the viewpoint that afterlife was good, peaceful and could get into the cycle of reincarnation, but had lower tendency to believe that man would joined with God or a higher power after death.
2. The attitude toward life of the undergraduates in Taiwan was positive. The undergraduates had more harmonious relationship with external world and less harmonious relationship with their selfhood.
3. The relationship between afterlife beliefs and attitudes toward life was marginally significant.
4. The undergraduates who believed in afterlife had more positive attitude toward life, and this positive relationship would be stronger when the undergraduates believed that afterlife was ”good”.
5. Lack of belief in afterlife, was not correlated with a negative attitude towards life.

The study adopted a narrative method to reveal the process, from ”understanding” to ”acting”, of the career rehabilitation of patients with chronic schizophrenia in a community rehabilitation center. In the first part of this study, ten patients (aged from 29 to 49) were interviewed and their career stories were analyzed with the method of narrative form. The results showed that patients' concept of career development had gradually deviated from a normal path since they suffered from psychotic diseases. Even when temporarily settled in community rehabilitation center, they still sustained loss and pain induced by psychotic disorders. They also felt uncertainty for the future and a sense of fluidity that, as a result, stops them from settling down in a place and establishing a career. the second part of this study, it was designed in terms of ”acting”-to develop a narrative approach based career rehabilitation group in order to assist patients with chronic schizophrenia to resettle in their lives and careers. The result showed that twelve patients, aged 25 to 48, could re-narrate new and constructive career stories through group interventions, despite the fact that the group dynamic was limited by the patients' psychotic symptoms. They reaffirmed the value of work, realized that the illness was only a part of their lives, and thus, accepted the possibility of a personal career plan for the future. These results supported the feasibility of the narrative approach based career rehabilitation group. Finally, the study presents a number of reflections from the researchers and suggestions for refining career rehabilitation strategies for patients with chronic schizophrenia in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-200809-x-24-147-179-a,24,2008,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling
The Invisible Love: A Preliminary Study of the Development of Relationships for Lesbian Couples in Taiwan,Wen-Yi Shieh,"relationship maintenance, commitment, relationship development, same-sex couple relationship, lesbian couples","Ten lesbian couples who have been together for more than a year were interviewed in the present study. The data explored three stages they went through while building their intimate relationships: awareness, initial contact, and relationship maintenance. The results highlighted the dynamic process of the development of lesbian couple relationship, and the uniqueness of such relationship (including its lack of clarity, its purity and enmeshment, and its flexibility regarding gender roles). The study also discusses the similarities and differences between lesbian couple relationships and heterosexual couple relationships.
1. Similarities: The three stages of lesbian couple relationship development is similar to that of the social exchange investment model that heterosexual couples go through. Even when facing differences in their life cycles, they still try hard to learn to accept each other and to build their own communication pattern.
2. Differences: Due to the exclusion of non-heterosexual couple relationship from societal norms, lesbians have to face uncertainty and struggle in attempting to express their interests in the other persons at the awareness stage. This half hidden couple relationship created more insecurity for both partners. At the same time, due to high expectations, the tension in the relationship was elevated. This, while it makes the relationship appear purer, creates more enmeshment. Finally and in order to resist the reaction from unfriendly environments, they also tend to pursue a relationship with more equality and role flexibility.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-200809-x-24-181-214-a,24,2008,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

The mother did not just take part in ”filial therapy training program”, but participated in the parental play sessions with the child for the total of 30, 40-minute sessions (one meeting held each week). The research is based upon the transcripts from filial therapy sessions and the analysis of two interviews with the mother, including pre and post-treatment. The results are the following:
1. In the process of filial therapy program learning, while the researcher plays an external object, the different internal object mirrors within the mother; this helps to reflect mother's self- image and mother's changes in attitude.
2. The researcher's self-image and intervention during program training enhances the changes in the mother's self-image and attitudes, in which the mother becomes the child's self-object (the ”good enough” mother).
3. The attitude and image changes of the external mother enable the reconstruction of internal objects within the child in the filial therapy play sessions.
4. The reconstructed object within the child helps in gaining more positive aspects of self.
5. Filial therapy enhances the relationship between the mother and the child. The mother can be more understanding and empathetic with the child, while a greater exchange of thoughts and feelings is observed between them. Finally, the mother has an overall positive feeling towards her role after the filial therapy program.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=17285186-200809-x-24-215-251-a,24,2008,Chinese Journal of Guidance and Counseling

Gender Differences in Factors Affecting Mental Health of College Freshmen,Chong-Shiann Hsu,"mental health, college freshman, gender difference","This study aimed to explore the gender differences in mental health of college freshman and the factors affecting it. The sample consisted of 16,198 freshmen from Technological and 20,299 from General Universities. Correlation analysis was performed on the basis of factor scores, and regression analysis was conducted by means of LISREL. It was found that female freshmen showed more psycho-physiological problems than males, and that male freshmen showed more problems related to social contact than females. Academic performance in senior high school, low-level competency in computer use, and parent-child relationships contributed positively to freshman mental health. The impact of family on major decisions predicted freshman mental health negatively. The following variables affected freshman mental health related to genders: teaching methods adopted by senior high school teachers, habits of reading newspaper and magazines, and living with family.

Coping Strategies of Taiwanese Women with a History of Childhood Sexual Abuse,Mei-Hua Chien,"coping strategies, Taiwanese women, childhood sexual abuse","Previous studies indicated that women with a history of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) often adopt avoidance strategies to deal with the impact of CSA. However, little is known about how their coping strategies change over time. The purpose of this qualitative study is to examine the coping strategies used by CSA survivors to deal with the long-term sequelae of CSA and to determine the factors that contribute to changes in coping strategies. A life-history design was used, and in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data from five Taiwanese participants, recruited by purposive sampling. All interviews were audio-taped and transcribed. A line-by-line approach has used to develop themes from the transcripts. The results indicate that strategies adopted to cope with the long-term effects of CSA include a variety of factors as optimism, bibliotherapy, avoidance of interpersonal intimacy, dissociation, and avoidance of flashbacks. During young adulthood, participants tended to change coping strategies as a result of facing the CSA trauma, changing careers, reframing the CSA experience, and developing a sense of empowerment from counseling experiences.

This research finds that sexual offender's denial behavior is on a continuum dimension with varying degrees and types. The denial behavior is characterized by external attributions and self-victimization. There are two types of primary denial behaviors, including denial of crime and minimization of victim harm. The main purpose of denial behavior is to avoid further damage both in the social and the personal level. Purposes at the social level are self protection in prison, avoidance of treatment responsibility, and prevention of discrimination and harm to themselves and their families. Purpose at the personal level is avoidance of inner sense of guilty. This research also finds that extinct factors of denial behavior include mitigation of threats from prison and judicature, interpersonal acceptance, and chances for self-introspection.

Back on Track: Why and How College Students Terminate Academic Procrastination,"Kun-Lin Tsai, Li-Li Huang","future time perspective, growth mindset, public self-consciousness, private self-consciousness, terminate procrastination","This paper investigated why and how college students terminate academic procrastination and materialize the idea of terminating procrastination. Three separate studies were conducted. The first research is a pilot study that adopted the questionnaire survey approach to collect data from 123 participants who have enrolled in college degree programs. Results show that almost all of the respondents have the experience of terminating academic procrastination. The reasons include ""There is not much time left,"" ""I could not be in such a slump,"" ""Continued procrastination would have led to unfavorable results in the future,"" ""The expectations of significant others regarding my performance"" and ""Reflections on past procrastination experiences."" The second research took a qualitative approach. It used the possible reasons for terminating procrastination from the first research to conduct focus interviews with 16 individuals. After comparing the procrastination phase and the termination of procrastination phase, it is demonstrated that: at the termination of the procrastination phase, interviewees showed more self-awareness, including introspection of their motivations to take action and becoming concerned about significant others' opinion of themselves. In terms of their perspective on time, the interviewees shifted away from present hedonism to future time perspective. With regard to their state of mind, they shifted away from fixed mindset to growth mindset. Also, interviewees indicated that they were able to inhibit distractions, and concepts such as hard work would lead to fruitful ends or to strive as much as one is able could help them transform notions of terminating procrastination into real action. In the third research, a quasi--experiment was conducted, targeting 627 participants who have enrolled in college degree programs. They were assigned short essay readings. Results show that the sense of the public self-consciousness, present hedonism, and fixed mindset cannot terminate procrastination, but the sense of private self-consciousness, future time perspective, and growth mindset can terminate procrastination. When an individual's sense of private self-consciousness, future time perspective, and growth mindset increases, the likelihood to inhibit distraction, and concepts such as hard work would lead to fruitful ends or maximum dedication tend to take shape, leading to the likelihood of the individual to take real action.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-N202301030005-00001,64.4,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"The Effect of Friendship Alienation on Mental Health: The Buffering Effects of the Chinese ""Yuan"" and ""Fen"" Beliefs","Shih-Chen Huang, Chin-Lung Chien","friendship alienation, yuanfen, friendship, psychotherapy, mental health","Friendship alienation is a common dilemma experienced by many Chinese people in life. It especially has negative impacts on the mental health of the alienated party, which cannot be ignored. The role of ""yuanfen"" (緣分) in adapting to relationship dilemmas has already been put forward and yuanfen has recently been subdivided into beliefs in ""yuan"" (緣) and ""fen"" (分). However, yuan and fen beliefs were for the most part hypothesized in the past to have respective effects on psychological adaptation. This paper first proposes the hypothesis that yuan and fen belief can work together (interact) to buffer the negative effects of friendship alienation on mental health. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the roles of the yuan and fen beliefs following friendship alienation, including the effect of ""friendship alienation"" on ""mental health"" and the moderating role of yuan and fen beliefs. In this study, adults aged 18 and above were adopted as subjects. Data was collected through online questionnaires. Participants were requested to fill out assessment scales measuring friendship alienation experiences, their yuan and fen beliefs, sense of loneliness, satisfaction with life, subjective happiness, etc. The results show that compared with those without experiences of friendship alienation, people who had experienced estrangement from their friends within two years indeed showed poorer mental health. The research results with greater significance show that 1) If the yuan and fen beliefs operate simultaneously, they play a buffering role on the negative impacts of alienation experience on mental health. If they both operate independently however, they do not have a buffering effect on the negative impacts of the alienation experience on mental health; and 2) It is worth noting that in situations where belief in yuan is low, and the belief in fen is higher, the more likely an experience of alienation would jeopardize subjective happiness and satisfaction with life. Overall, the joint operation of the beliefs in yuan and fen may play a buffering role in the negative effects of friendship alienation. Nevertheless, it is also worth noting that under specific circumstances, yuan and fen do not always have positive effects on negative relationships as mentioned in the preceding literature. Finally, the research results were targeted for further discussion. The research limitations and directions were also indicated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-N202301030005-00002,64.4,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Data was gathered from a variety of Taiwan industries including semiconductor, service, manufacturing, and chemistry. Results from the 248 full-time worker participants demonstrated that dispositional envy has positive influences on both types of gossip at work (positive and negative gossip). Further, organizational identification was favorably linked to positive gossip, and disidentification with the organization was connected favorably to negative gossip. Organizational identification moderates the correspondence between dispositional envy and negative, rather than positive, gossip, whereas the moderating effect of organizational disidentification was nonsignificant. Therefore, organizational identification has both direct and moderating effects on workplace gossip.

Cross-Cultural Identified Affect Coding System for Observing Marital Affective Interaction in Taiwan,"Yi-Jen Lu, Shu-Chuan Chen, Yu-Ping Chen, Mei-Feng Lin","martial and couple studies, culturally identified translational study, Specific Affect Coding System","The Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), developed by Gottman, has been used to predict the stability of a marriage by observing interaction and emotional expression between couples. In recent observational studies of couples, the SPAFF has been recognized as the best evidence of construct and criterion validity. However, habitual behaviors derived from traditional Chinese culture, such as discouraging expression, indirect communication, and emotion suppression, may impede exploration in emotional expression. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the construct of emotional expression and reflect the essence of couple interaction through observational approaches. The aims of this study were to develop a culturally validated Chinese version of the SPAFF (SPAFF-C-24) and examine its appropriateness for use in marital and couple studies in Taiwan. Using a methodology that combines translational study, expert panel review, and small-scale study with 20 couple dyads, we established the reliability and validity of the SPAFF-C-24 through expert validity, inter-rater reliability, and criteria-related validity. The SPAFF-C-24 was reviewed by 10 experts, who found that the Content Validity Index (CVI) ranged from .79~ .96, indicating a reliable instrument with good content validity. Throughout the coder training with 20 couples in a small-scale study, the mean consistency between two coders with the agreement score in husbands and wives were .82 and .70, respectively. The mean inter-rater stability with Kappa values in husbands and wives were .53 and .57, respectively. Acceptable coding stability was thus endorsed with the overall agreement of 85.4% and its stability with a mean Kappa value of .55 among coders. In the criteria-related validity, the negative/neutral emotional aspects of the SPAFF-C-24 were significantly correlated with the scores in the Brief Version of Chinese Marital Affection Scale, Marital Quality Scale, and Couple Interaction Scale. Nevertheless, only partial correlations were identified between positive emotional aspects of the SPAFF-C-24 and those aforementioned subscales. In conclusion, the newly derived SPAFF-C-24 could be used to observe affective expressiveness among Chinese couples in Taiwan. However, the appropriateness of added codes and positive affects in the SPAFF-C-24 requires further validation through a large-scale study.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-N202301030005-00004,64.4,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Perceived Scar Severity and Social Anxiety Among Burn Patients: The Mediating Roles of Perceived Social Stigma and Body Image Dissatisfaction,"Wan-Rou Lin, Yi-Jen Su","social stigma, serial mediation, burn patients, social anxiety, body image","Burn scars affect not only burn patients' physical function but also their psychosocial adjustment. Encountering stigmatizing behaviors from others may increase burn patients' negative evaluation of their appearance-that is, body image dissatisfaction (BID), which raises their anxiety and fear of social interactions. The current study examined the association between perceived scar severity and social anxiety symptoms as mediated by perceived stigmatization and BID. Participants comprised 108 burn survivors of the 2015 Formosa Fun Coast Water Park fire disaster, including 63% females with a mean age of 24.19 years old and a mean total body surface area burned of 50.15%. We conducted a two-wave design at two years (Time 1, T1) and three years (Time 2, T2) after the 2015 fire. Serial mediation analysis was used to determine whether perceived social stigma and BID mediate the association between perceived scar severity and social anxiety symptoms serially. Results show that three years after the 2015 fire, 22.2% of the participants met the DSM-IV criteria for probable social anxiety disorder. After controlling for depressive symptoms at T1, we observed a significant serial mediation effect of T1 perceived scar severity on T2 social anxiety symptoms via T1 perceived social stigma and T1 BID. Note however that the reverse serial mediation effect was nonsignificant. In cross-lagged analysis, we determined that T1 BID was significantly predictive of T2 perceived social stigma; however, T1 perceived social stigma was not significantly predictive of T2 BID. This result contradicts the pathway of the serial mediation model described above. Overall, a relatively high proportion of burn patients reported clinically significant symptoms of social anxiety three years after the 2015 fire. Our findings highlight the importance of body image and social stigma in the postburn adjustment process.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-N202301030005-00005,64.4,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology

These preschoolers were assessed by his/her mothers (T1, n = 245; T2, n = 200; T3, n = 144) and father (T1, n = 163; T2, n = 130; T3 n = 97) on the scales of effortful control from Children's Behavior Questionnaire and these parents also reported his/her authoritative and authoritarian disciplines via Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire at these three waves. The bidirectional relationships between preschoolers' effortful control and mothers' and fathers' discipline styles were analyzed in the framework of cross-lagged panel model. Six models were set and analyzed in structural equation model. Results shows that autoregressive consistencies of preschoolers' effortful control and parent's authoritative and authoritarian disciplines were high. The impacts of maternal disciplines on preschoolers' effortful control were different from patental disciplines. Maternal authoritative style at first year had a positive impact on preschoolers' effortful control at second year and preschoolers' effortful control at first year also had a positive impact on maternal authoritative style at second year. The same influence patterns also appeared from second to third year. Maternal authoritarian discipline at the first year had a negative impact on the preschoolers' effortful control at second yer, then preschoolers' effortful control at the second year had a negative impact o mother's authoritarian discipline at the third year. On the other hand, paternal authoritative styles at the first year had sustantive impact on preschoolers' effortful control, but not vice versa. Then preschoolers' effortful control at second year had an impact on paternal disciplines at third year, but not vice versa.

Thus, the current study examines the role of emotional influence on semantic processing for Taiwanese alexithymics in an emotional semantic judgment task. Emotion valence (positive, negative, and neutral) and association strength (strong, weak) were independently varied to study emotional semantic processing. Participants were asked to decide whether two sequentially presented Chinese emotional words were related in meaning. This study identified two main results. First, compared to individuals with low alexithymia, individuals with high alexithymia demonstrated facilitation effects for emotion words during weak association. Second, these facilitation effects were closely related to their alexithymia traits. In the present study, individuals with alexithymia displayed increased activation of sensitivity to emotional stimuli at the early stage of information processing, which enabled quick responses during semantic judgment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202209-202210030001-202210030001-263-277,64.3,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Development of a Tablet-Based Task Battery for Executive Function Assessment,"Yei-Yu Yeh, Ting-Yu Lin, Tsung-Ren Huang, Chun-Yu Kuo","executive function, tablet-based battery","The aim of this study was to develop a theory-driven, tablet-based battery of executive function tasks that is free of charge. According to a theoretical framework, three levels of executive function can be identified. The basic level consists of working memory and inhibitory control, the second level focuses on cognitive flexibility, and the third level includes reasoning, planning, and problem solving. Given that the functions at the third level require effective processing at the first two levels, this battery measured individual abilities on executing the latter functions. Additional functions included executive controls that have been suggested to be important. The battery consisted of 17 tasks assorted into six categories: processing speed, information maintenance, inhibition, updating, switching and resource allocation. Processing speed was measured by the speed in simple and choice reaction times. Information maintenance included maintenance of single items and paired associates. Three types of representations were used for single items: spatial information, symbols that are difficult to name, and objects that can be interfaced with the representations in long-term memory. A delayed matching-to-sample task and a delayed response task were also adopted to assess the information maintenance ability. The former task evaluated maintenance over 5 and 10 seconds compared with perceptual matching; the latter examined the effects of encoding and retrieving one or four items. Inhibition functions were assessed by three tasks: the reverse Stroop task, stop signal task, and anti-saccade task. Updating functions were also evaluated by three tasks: running memory of spatial information, running memory of symbols, and running memory of objects. The trail-making test, a figure task, and a hearts-and-flowers task were used to measure the ability to switch for cognitive flexibility. These three tasks differ in the dimensions for switching: between color and digits, between task rules, and between color and shapes. A rotation span task was adopted to assess the ability to allocate cognitive resources. In the battery, 10 tasks adopted accuracy and reaction time as the measures, and 7 adopted a 1-up-1-down staircase method to measure the span of information maintenance, updating, and resource allocation. Two hundred and eight college students participated in the study across two or three sessions of approximately 50 minutes each, with a rest between tasks. The pattern of results was in agreement with the findings in the literature, supporting the use of a tablet-based battery that employed a staircase method for measuring working memory span. Given the limitations in the current version, a recommendation of the context for using this battery is provided in the discussion. Future studies could consider measuring the abilities of processing linguistic information, evaluating each executive function with a broader range of tasks, and using an accuracy-based battery. More importantly, future studies should examine the reliability and validity of this battery while developing norms for different age levels.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202209-202210030001-202210030001-279-310,64.3,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Chinese Mothers' Belief Systems about Learning and Shared-Reading Behaviors: The Pragmatic View of Effort vs. the Incremental View of Intelligence,"Keng-Ling Lay, Kai-Chieh Lin, Shu-Chuan Wu, Yi-Miau Tsai, Thai-Tsuan Chang, Su-Ying Huang, Che Cheng","preschooler, shared reading, incremental view of intelligence, temperament, pragmatic view of effort","Culture is transmitted both symbolically and behaviorally. The way parents teach and interact with young children may reflect the mindset about learning embedded in them by their particular culture. This study chose to test this through shared picture book reading, as it can be considered an activity either just for fun, or to develop reading capacity. We compared whether and how each of the two types of learning beliefs-the incremental view of intelligence documented in Western research versus the pragmatic view of effort rooted in the learning philosophy of Chinese culture-are manifested in Chinese mothers' shared-reading behaviors. We were especially interested in, above and beyond the variance of the incremental view of intelligence, the unique predictability of the pragmatic view of effort, which subscribes to the belief that effort never fails to improve performance even when one has already reached peak levels of performance. We also investigated the moderating effect of mothers' impression of their child's temperament on the relation between mothers' learning beliefs and parenting behaviors. Fifty dyads of 4- to 5-year-old preschoolers and their mothers participated in a ten-minute shared-reading session. The mothers' Child-Centered, Parent-Centered, and Traditional Chinese Teaching Behaviors were coded using the time-sampling method. Mothers also filled out questionnaires assessing their incremental view of intelligence and pragmatic view of effort. They also reported their child's temperament using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire-Very Short Form. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that, after controlling for child sex and maternal educational level, neither the main effects of mothers' incremental view of intelligence and children's temperament nor their interaction predicted any of the three types of mothers' shared-reading behaviors. Conversely, when mothers perceived a lower level of inhibitory control in their child's temperament, mothers' pragmatic view of effort positively predicted their Traditional Chinese Teaching Behaviors. When mothers perceived their child's activity level to be high, their pragmatic view of effort predicted less Child-Centered Behaviors; this effect stayed significant even when the variance of mothers' incremental view of intelligence was statistically controlled. This research suggests that culturally rooted learning beliefs and pedagogies are interwoven with parental perceptions of their child's learning propensities, even before children start school. The dispositional, parental, and cultural factors altogether lead to a learning milieu that situates Chinese children in a culture-bound socioemotional context of learning.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202209-202210030001-202210030001-311-340,64.3,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Data were collected in two time points, one week prior to and after the referendum, respectively. Analysis of the total 205 participants indicated that voters' positive attitudes toward same-sex marriage prior to the referendum had a significant positive correlation with their psychological distress after the referendum, although only on the interpersonal-oriented psychological distress (loneliness). In addition, the relationship of positive attitudes toward same-sex marriage and loneliness is fully mediated by ego depletion. Furthermore, this study examined the psychological processes and distresses experienced by groups with different sexual orientations in this gender equality social event, which provided more valuable information in predicting the psychological consequences of such gender equality social event. It was found that the positive attitudes of the heterosexual group toward same-sex marriage were significantly related to both depression and loneliness, while the psychological process was fully mediated by ego depletion.

Based on the social exchange theory, the current study investigates whether job crafting serves a mediating role in this relationship and examines the moderating effect of perceived organizational support (POS) on the direct and indirect effects of transformational leadership on P-J fit. The two-wave data were collected from 213 full-time employees in Taiwan. The results indicated that (a) transformational leadership was positively related to P-J fit and job crafting, (b) job crafting was positively related to P-J fit, (c) job crafting mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and P-J fit, (d) when POS is high (vs. low POS), the positive relationship between transformational leadership and job crafting is stronger, and (e) when POS is high (vs. low POS), the indirect relationship between transformational leadership and P-J fit (via job crafting) is stronger.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202209-202210030001-202210030001-359-384,64.3,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Post-traumatic Growth and Rumination Following a Cancer Diagnosis: The Moderating Roles of Psychological Distress and Emotional Regulation Strategies,"Rou-Jun Chen, Pei-Chiung Tu","intrusive rumination, cancer, deliberate rumination, emotion-regulation strategies, post-traumatic growth, psychological distress","Backgrounds: Many studies have found that the concepts of intrusive rumination (IR) and deliberate rumination (DR) play significant roles in post-traumatic growth, and it is the change from intrusive to deliberate rumination that facilitates post-traumatic growth. However, most studies exploring the relationship between rumination and posttraumatic growth have utilized a cross-sectional methodology or individuals from natural disasters. Additionally, no empirical study has investigated the role of psychological distress and emotion regulation strategies in the revised model of post-traumatic growth. Therefore, this current research employed cancer outpatients as participants and a retrospective two-time-point approach to examine the process of violated core beliefs, two types of ruminative thoughts, and post-traumatic growth among cancer outpatients. Furthermore, the study explored whether psychological distress and emotion-regulation strategies may moderate the above relationship to expand the understanding of the cognitive process of post-traumatic growth. Methods: This study recruited 184 cancer outpatients diagnosed between six months and five years following their initial intensive treatment. Self-reported questionnaires were the major instruments used, and the moderator-mediator analysis was employed to examine the data. Results: The pathways of the sequential relationship between (1) initial IR and recent IR, and (2) initial IR and recent IR, as well as recent DR, can partially mediate the relationship between the destruction of core beliefs by the cancer diagnosis and the post-traumatic growth. Psychological distress positively moderated the relationship between initial IR and recent IR and subsequently impaired post-traumatic growth. The reappraisal strategy negatively moderated the relationship between initial IR and recent IR and then facilitated the subsequent post-traumatic growth. Conclusions: This current study found that IR and DR had a sequential mediating role in the association between the disruption of core beliefs and post-traumatic growth. It is also the first to demonstrate the moderating effect of psychological distress and emotion-regulation strategies on intrusive rumination at different time points, which then affects the post-traumatic growth among cancer patients.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202209-202210030001-202210030001-385-411,64.3,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Interplay of Attachment and Attention Processing of Emotional Faces: The Influence of Exposure Time,"Yu-Lien Huang, Sue-Huei Chen","attentional bias, defensive response, attachment, time-course pattern","Individuals with attachment anxiety or avoidance respectively display vigilance or avoidance response once detecting a threat. Inconsistent findings in existing studies may result from variation in the durations of emotion presentation. The present study was thus designed to investigate whether the influence of attachment on attentional bias toward emotional faces may vary over time. All participants (N = 290) were assessed their attachment tendencies and examined attentional biases toward emotional faces at durations of 200 ms and 2,000 ms. A trial-level bias score (TL-BS) was computed to capture dynamics of biased attention. Results show that attachment avoidance tended to be associated with higher attentional avoidance from happy faces at the duration of 2,000 ms, while no correlation between attachment anxiety and attention bias toward emotional faces was found. This finding may shed light on potential usage of the defensive processing of happy emotion at a later stage of emotional information processing in individuals with inclination of attachment avoidance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202206-202207040001-202207040001-137-150,64.2,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The research approach was hermeneutic phenomenological psychology. 4 bereaved caregivers were recruited and each of the participant was interviewed twice, with the second interview conducted after 6 months of the first one. The analysis revealed three general structures of time experiences: (1) time is out of joint: the deep quiet moment. (2) resolution time: nearing of the future. (3) duration of time: the coexistence of the past and the present. The subjective time experiences of bereaved caregivers might contradict the objective linear time assumption embedded in modern society, causing more feelings of isolation and loneliness of the bereaved. The death experiences have revealed the life essence of ab-ground, forcing the bereaved caregivers to confront their authentic self and to have resoluteness of their own lives.

Experiential Avoidance Moderates the Relationship between Positive Schema and Autobiographical Memory Specificity in Individuals with Interpersonal Traumas,"Yi-Wen Kung, Sue-Huei Chen","experiential avoidance, interpersonal traumas, autobiographical memory specificity, self-memory system, positive schema","The shattered assumptions theory indicates that traumatic events, especially interpersonal traumas, could shatter positive schema; thus, survivors may develop posttraumatic stress symptoms. Reduced autobiographical memory specificity has also been identified in survivors, and its mechanism is based on two perspectives: the self-memory system and functional avoidance. The self-memory system posits that self-schema can guide autobiographical memory retrieval and inhibit specific information (i.e., traumatic information) that is self-incoherent or threatening. According to the functional avoidance mechanism, memory retrieval is terminated to reduce emotional disturbance associated with aversive events. One type of functional avoidance is experiential avoidance, which is an unwillingness to have contact with aversive experiences. Few studies have explored the aforementioned relationships. This study aimed to examine the association between positive schema and autobiographical memory specificity (AMS) in survivors of interpersonal trauma and to explore the moderating effect of experiential avoidance on the association. In this study, 94 participants with interpersonal trauma completed self-report measures assessing positive schema, experiential avoidance, and AMS with different valences and self-relevant cues. Results indicate that experiential avoidance moderates the relationship between positive schema and AMS with highly self-relevant cues. Specifically, among individuals with high experiential avoidance, those with higher-level positive schema displayed less AMS in response to highly self-relevant positive and negative cues. These findings not only support the role of experiential avoidance as a moderator between positive schema and AMS, but they also suggest its protective role in AMS, regardless of whether the memories are positive or negative. In addition, the effect of experiential avoidance may hinder self-coherence or may retain an inflexible positive schema and thus impede posttraumatic adjustment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202206-202207040001-202207040001-175-189,64.2,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Social Value Orientations on Resource Allocation: The Moderation Analysis of Relationship Closeness and Competitive Situation,"Tzu-I Fang, Chun-Yu Kuo","closeness, competitive situation, resource allocation, social value orientation","Since resources are limited, resource allocation is a major issue in psychology. The decision-making process underlying resource allocation is complicated and influenced by numerous factors. Social value orientation is a continuous construct for representing the preference for resource allocation. The triple-dominance measure of social value orientation is a frequently used instrument for predicting real-life behavior. Social value orientation has been treated as a stable psychological attribute across various situations. However, it's easily affected and involves the process of resource allocation considering the closeness between oneself and others. In the present study, the closeness between oneself and others was manipulated across the experiments to systematically investigate how closeness affects the process of resource allocation. The results demonstrated that the allocated resources varied with different degrees of closeness, and individuals with different social value orientations showed different patterns of resource allocation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202206-202207040001-202207040001-191-215,64.2,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Incorporating Response Confidence into Adaptive Methods for Threshold Estimation,"Che Cheng, Yan-Jun Huang, Yung-Fong Hsu","threshold estimation, response confidence, adaptive methods","In psychophysical studies of discrimination, thresholds are commonly estimated by (nonparametric, fixed-step-size) adaptive methods using a binary response format. However, it can sometimes be challenging for participants to give a dichotomous response. To resolve the issue, scholars have suggested adding more response categories to the algorithm (Kaernbach, 2001; Klein, 2001). However, Hsu and Chin (2014) argued that their extension has some limitations. Following Hsu and Chin (2014), we proposed an alternative framework to incorporate response confidence into existing adaptive methods for Yes/No tasks. In particular, we introduced the concept of a ＂cut-off,＂ thereby expanding the meaning of psychometric functions to psychometric surfaces. We performed simulations to investigate the feasibility of the framework. We considered three adaptive methods, namely Derman's Up-Down (DUD) method (Derman, 1957), the Biased Coin Design (BCD) (Durham & Flournoy, 1995), and the Weighted Up-Down (WUD) method (Kaernbach, 1991). Setting 0.75 as the target probability for the threshold, we systematically manipulated the initial value, step size, cut-off, and number of trials to examine their impact on the threshold estimation performance of the three adaptive methods. Our simulation results showed that the proposed framework is applicable in general and that WUD and BCD performed slightly better than DUD. We also extended the framework to the Same/Different task, where the psychometric function is not monotonically increasing. We tackled this issue by providing mappings between the response confidence scales of the Same/Different task and the Yes/No task. Doing this enables us to obtain a transformed psychometric function that satisfies the monotonicity property, and thus the aforementioned framework can be readily applied to the Same/Different task.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202206-202207040001-202207040001-217-232,64.2,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Monday Blues? The Impacts of Catch-up Sleep Duration and Social Jet Lag on Insufficient Weekday Sleep with Different Weekend Sleep Strategies,"Fan-Chi Hsiao, Chien-Ming Yang","Monday Blues, Catch-Up Sleep, Social Jet Lag, Insufficient sleep","Weekend catch-up sleep (CUS) is a strategy commonly used to cope with insufficient sleep during weekdays. Previous studies focused more on the usefulness of CUS in compensating for the sleep loss on weekday nights, but might have overlooked its possible negative influence due to ＂social jet lag (SJL)＂ resulting from the changes in the sleep-wake schedule. Thus, this study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the effects of different weekend sleep patterns, with different degrees of CUS and SJL, on subsequent sleep and daytime functioning with an experimental design. The study included 69 young healthy adults as participants. They were randomly assigned to three groups: a ＂delayed weekend sleep schedule＂ group (G1: n = 20), a ＂delayed weekend sleep schedule + CUS＂ group (G2: n = 24), and a ＂delayed weekend rising schedule + CUS＂ group (G3: n = 25). All participants had to go through a two-week study period: a baseline week and an experimental week. During the baseline week, participants had to restrict their time in bed (TIB) to 7 hours each night; during the experimental week, they were required to follow a regular sleep schedule with a restricted TIB of 7 hours on weekday nights, and to follow one of three experimental sleep patterns on weekends. The weekend sleep pattern of G1 consists of no CUS and 2 hours of SJL; G2 was composed of 2 hours of CUS and 2 hours of SJL; G3 involved 2 hours of CUS and 1 hour of SJL. Upon awakening from the last nights of the baseline and experimental periods, each participant rated their subjective sleepiness on the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) and emotion on the Profile of Mood State (POMS), and then came to the laboratory to complete the Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) on the following Monday morning. Those groups with CUS (G2 and G3) showed higher wake after sleep onset (WASO) on weekend nights in the experiment period than the baseline. G3, compared to the other two groups, showed a trend of decreased negative emotion after the experimental night. However, G1 and G2 showed increased negative emotion compared to their baseline. The findings suggest that CUS might not be a good coping strategy to compensate for insufficient sleep on weekdays. More CUS might lead to larger SJL, which was found to be related to elevated levels of negative mood. The possible compensatory effect of CUS might be cancelled out by the negative effect of SJL.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202206-202207040001-202207040001-233-262,64.2,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Age-related Differences in Facial Expression Discrimination in Adults in Taiwan,"Ya-Ju Li, Gary Chon-Wen Shyi","expression discrimination, facial expressions, age differences","Prior research has indicated that older adults have worse ability in identifying some specific facial expressions than younger adults. In this research, we adopted Taiwanese Face Database and developed five tasks. The tasks were designed to assess different aspects of discriminating facial expressions that may have implications for revealing differences between younger and older adults regarding their abilities to process facial expressions. Two studies were conducted: In Study 1, we collected young adults' performances on the five tasks to establish the norms for comparison. In Study 2, we collected performances of older adults and compared them with those of young adults. However, due to the time and physical constraints, older adults only participated in the first three tasks. Results of Study 1 showed that young adults were better at discriminating between positive and negative facial expressions (e.g., happy vs. other negative expressions) than discriminating between negative expressions (e.g., angry vs. disgusted). Results of Study 2 showed that in general, older adults discriminated negative facial expressions less well than younger adults did. In addition, older adults exhibited inferior performances when compared to younger adults in discriminating between happy and negative expressions, and discriminating between neutral and negative expressions. However, whether these findings can be construed as evidence to support the positivity effect among elderly people requires further investigation. In summary, the present research not only developed a tool for assessing abilities in discriminating facial expressions, but also found age differences in these abilities. The findings can potentially be used to design activities that may help older adults improve their abilities in discriminating facial expressions, and elevate the quality of their social lives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202203-202204010001-202204010001-1-31,64.1,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Comparing Face and Object Discrimination in Neurotypical Adults and Adults with Autism: A Morphing Paradigm,"En-Yun Hsiung, Sarina Hui-Lin Chien, Chien-Hui Kao, Shin-Lei Peng","object perception, autism spectrum disorder, morphing paradigm, face perception","Recognizing faces and objects are essential perceptual skills for human survival. Previous studies exploring face and object perception in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reported inconclusive results. Some studies suggested that adults with ASD exhibited impaired face processing but spared object perception; in contrast, other studies showed unimpaired face processing and enhanced object perception, suggesting superior featural-based processing in ASD. However, most studies did not control the task difficulties of face and object discrimination. Hence, we adopted the morphing technique to control physical similarities among the stimuli with equated task difficulties. Using computerized morphing face/object discrimination tasks, we investigated whether adults with ASD are impaired in holistic processing or enhanced in featural processing. We also explored the correlations between individual Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores and their task performances. Twenty-four adults with ASD and 24 NT adults received the morphing face/object discrimination task, and their accuracies were measured. The results showed that: For the morphing face discrimination task, the mean accuracies were not significantly different between the two groups; however, the estimated discrimination threshold of the ASD group (33.12%) was significantly higher than the NT group (25.87%). For the morphing object discrimination task, both groups had the same mean accuracies and estimated discrimination thresholds (ASD: 21.67%; NT: 23.12%). Lastly, the trend analyses revealed a significant linear component in the ASD group for both face and object tasks, while the NT group showed linear as well as quadratic components. In sum, the present study demonstrated that, compared to neurotypical adults, adults with ASD exhibited a larger discrimination threshold for morphing face, indicating impaired holistic processing. Additionally, the linear trend suggests that adults with ASD compensatorily relied on featural-based processing when differentiating among morphing images of faces and objects.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202203-202204010001-202204010001-33-55,64.1,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Conveying Spatial and Kinematic Representations in Text Reading via Words and Pictures: An Eye-movement Analysis,"Yu-Cin Jian, Chao-Jung Wu","kinematic representation, eye movements, reading, spatial configuration","This study investigated how words and pictures convey spatial and kinematic representations in a reading condition and the relations between these two representations. Participants read a text (text group) describing the spatial configuration of a flushing cistern or viewed a diagram (diagram group) and completed a spatial test. Then, the two groups read the same text describing the kinematic machine operation and revised their first test answers. The participants' eye movements were recorded while reading the kinematic information text. According to the results, the text group's drawings showed the component relations more precisely, indicating that words helped readers capture detailed continuous relations, but the diagram group's drawings better approximated the original picture, indicating the advantage of depicting overall relations. Analysis of the drawing tests indicated that kinematic representations help readers revise inner spatial representations mainly of continuous relations of components rather than part-whole relations. Moreover, eye movement data indicated that the groups differed in both global and local eye movements, and that different internal spatial representations of the spatial and diagram groups influenced the following kinematic information text reading. The text group had significantly shorter total fixation duration and second-pass reading time on the kinematic text, fewer complicated concept sentences (i.e., outlet processes), and fewer target words for components than the diagram group. In summary, this study confirmed that pictures and words served fundamentally different functions in conveying spatial configurations and clarified the interaction of spatial and kinematic representations from reading to mental model construction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202203-202204010001-202204010001-57-76,64.1,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Adaptive Memory: Different Effects of Reproductive Processing on Male and Female Memory,"Yu Rui, Tao Yun","adaptive memory, reproductive processing, sex difference, mate preferences","As one of the major pressures in human evolution, reproduction may shape the characteristics of human memory. Men and women develop different mate preferences in reproductive tasks, which have different effects on their memory. In this study, face pictures and personality trait words were used as experimental materials to explore the different effect of reproductive processing on male and female memory. The study set two matching processing conditions to explore whether reproductive processing could bring better memory results to the subjects. One was a blind date condition, representing reproductive processing, and the other was a recruitment condition, representing non-reproductive processing. In experiment 1, the face pictures were used as the experimental material. The result shows that male subjects have better recognition of the faces under the reproductive condition. While, there is no difference in female memory of the faces under reproductive and non-reproductive conditions. In experiment 2, the words representing personality traits were used as experimental materials. The result shows that female participants have better memory of trait words under the reproductive condition, while there is no difference in male memory of trait words between reproductive and non-reproductive conditions. In conclusion, this study finds that men have better memory of female faces under reproductive conditions, while women have more obvious memory advantages for male trait words under reproductive conditions compared to non-reproductive conditions. These results prove that reproductive processing can bring memory advantages, but also show that there may be differences between the two sexes in memory mechanisms due to different preferences for mate selection.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202203-202204010001-202204010001-77-90,64.1,2022,Chinese Journal of Psychology

This result indicated that participants belonging to the integration with high mainstream orientation profile showed a more positive psychological and sociocultural adaptation; in contrast, the marginalization profile had relatively weaker adaptation outcomes. It is found that there were no significant differences between separation with low ethnic contact and integration with high mainstream orientation profile with respect to psychological adaptation.

Investigative Decision-Making by Criminal Investigators in Taiwan,"Chih-Hung Shih, Ivar Fahsing, Jhih-Cing Yang","investigative decision making, investigative hypothesis, Criminal investigation","Criminal investigation, which is generally conducted in knowledge-intensive and time-sensitive environments, presents a critical challenge to criminal investigators. The success of a criminal investigation significantly depends on the investigator's ability to generate possible investigative hypotheses and test those using different lines of inquiry. Criminal investigation is conventionally considered a skill, where the investigator's field experiences are crucial to improve the field. A few studies have focused on investigative decision making in Taiwan. This research aims to examine the effects of professional experience and investigative tipping points on the quality of investigative hypotheses and investigative actions conducted by investigators. A quasi-experimental design developed by Fahsing & Ask (2016) was employed, where 32 senior investigators and novice police officers were presented with two semi-fictitious cases. They were asked to report all the relevant investigative hypotheses and necessary investigative actions, which were evaluated against the established gold standard. The results showed that investigators with greater professional experience presented improved investigative actions but not hypotheses. In particular, participants tended to generate criminal hypotheses and ignored noncriminal ones. The investigative tipping point did not have a significant effect on the participants' responses concerning the production of gold-standard hypotheses and lines of inquiry. Hence, it was arrived at the conclusion that investigative decision making actually existed in criminal investigation process, which could not be improved without systematical and continued training.

Familiarity of Actions Leads Infants to Privilege Goals in Their Imitation of Others' Acts,"Wei-Ping Wang, Chi-Tai Huang","Direct mapping, Goal-directed, Goal, Action familiarity, Imitation","During observational learning of goal-directed action, infants tend to simplify the form of action to ensure that the goal is copied. As recent findings suggest that infants' sensitivity to the goal structure of action is reliant on their own experience with particular actions, the present study further examines whether the precedence of goal in infants' imitation is susceptible to the familiarity of the presented action. Eighteen-month-old infants observed an adult hop or slide a toy animal into one of two boxes (box condition) or to a final location (no-box condition). The toy moved along either a straight-line path familiar to infants (Experiment 1) or a novel turning-line path (Experiment 2). Overall, in the box condition, infants were more likely to copy the goal box while ignoring the hopping and sliding motion; in the nobox condition, they produced the opposite pattern of imitation. However, further analyses of the tendency to put the toy into boxes showed that infants' choice of the adult's goal was significantly higher than chance only in Experiment 1, suggesting that familiar actions determines whether infants privilege goals in their imitation of others' acts. To identify the goal of an agent's action requires not only the perceivable outcome, but it also requires a perception-action transduction that transfers observed acts into infants' own motor patterns. Familiar actions that infants are able to perform directly activate the equivalent body movements in their own motor repertoire. The results are consistent with the notion of direct mapping, suggesting that infants gain insight into goals through action experiences.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202112-202201030003-202201030003-335-356,63.4,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Sixty children (83.3% boys) aged 9-12 years comprised of 30 children with ADHD and 30 typically developing children participated in this study. Children completed the emotion awareness questionnaire and Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. Parents completed the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Rating Scale, Version IV. The results indicated that comparing to typically developing children, children with ADHD demonstrated impairments in differentiating emotions, attending to others' emotions, verbal sharing of emotions, and analyses of emotions. There were no significant differences in not hiding emotions and bodily unawareness. The multiple deficits of emotion awareness were not related to ADHD symptoms. This study found that the school-aged children with ADHD report more problems in emotion awareness than the typically developing children. Children with ADHD had lower levels in differentiating emotions, attending to others' emotions, verbal sharing of emotions, and analyses of emotions.

Exploring the Development of Featural and Configural Face Processing in School-age Children and Its Association with Empathy,"Yu-Shao Kuo, Sarina Hui-Lin Chien","school-age children, Empathy Quotient (EQ), configural processing, featural processing, face perception","Face perception involves both configural and featural processing. The developmental progression of configural versus featural processing in childhood remains debated. To date, most studies focused on western children; furthermore, the link between face processing and empathy in children is less well-understood. The present study investigated the development of featural and configural processing in Taiwanese children; we also explored the association between individuals' empathy, gender, and their face recognition performance. We tested 33 Taiwanese adults and 72 7- to 12-year-old children. Each participant received an Empathy Quotient (EQ)questionnaire and a computerized face discrimination task, which included four conditions (by altering a featural or a configural information): change identity, change eyes, widen eye spacing, and move up mouth. The results showed that (1)the accuracy of the ＂change identity＂ was the highest, followed by the ＂change eyes,＂ the ＂widen eye spacing,＂ and the ＂move up mouth＂ conditions. (2)Girls performed better than boys, but female and male adults were about equal. (3)Adults performed better than children in almost all conditions, except that the 11-12-year-old girls' accuracies on the ＂change eyes＂ and the ＂widen eye spacing＂ conditions were no different from the adults'. (4)Girls had a higher EQ score than boys, but women and men had similar EQ scores, and the correlations were higher with the Caucasian faces. In sum, our study suggests that in school-age children, girls had higher empathy and better face recognition accuracy than boys; 11-12-year-old girls were particularly mature. Meanwhile, the majority of children still performed significantly worse than the adults, meaning that children's configural and featural face processing continues to improve in adolescence.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202109-202110040002-202110040002-225-247,63.3,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology
You must Remember the Whole for the Reappearance of A Part to Capture Your Attention,Chun-Yu Kuo,"memory strategy, working memory, attentional capture","When an external stimulus refreshes an internal representation maintained in a person's working memory, it captures his or her attention. This working memory-based attentional capture has been demonstrated in various contexts using different stimuli. However, few studies have investigated this phenomenon using part of a visual display maintained in working memory to capture attention. In four experiments, I addressed this issue using a dual-task paradigm. The participants remembered the spatial locations of four colored disks for later recognition, judged the direction of a moving stimulus along with a static distractor, and recognized whether a probe display matched the memorized locations. Color was irrelevant to both the memory and attention tasks. In the valid condition, the color of the moving target was identical to the previously displayed color, and in the invalid condition, the color of the static distractor was the same as the previously displayed color. In Experiments 1 and 2, four white disks were used in a recognition task to probe the to-be-remembered locations. In Experiment 3, four white hexagon stars were used in a recognition task to probe the locations. In Experiment 4, a solid line showed the contour of the four locations for the recognition task. Colored disks were used as stimuli in the motion task for Experiments 1 and 4, whereas colored crosses were used in Experiment 2. Experiment 3 combined the design of Experiments 1 and 2 as a within-subject design. The results showed working memory-driven attentional capture only in Experiment 1 and an object-matched condition in Experiment 3, with two colored disks presented in the motion judgment task and four white disks probed for location memory. The contrast in the results across the three experiments suggests that the parts must be an important aspect of the memorized representation for its reappearance to capture a person's attention. When the judgment required comparison with the memorized representation based on the four disks, the spatial locations of the four disks were crucial for accurate decision making. Thus, the reappearance of one colored disk could capture attention, whereas the appearance of a cross in the same color could not. When the spatial configuration of the four disks was emphasized in the memorized representation (Experiment 4), the reappearance of the same part did not capture attention.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202109-202110040002-202110040002-249-263,63.3,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology
An Investigation of Information Processing Efficiency in Elite Athletes via Workload Capacity,"Chih-Chun Lin, Chien-Wei Liang, Ming-Yan Juang, Cheng-Ta Yang, Chun-Hao Wang","event-related potentials, workload capacity, systems factorial technology, strategic athletes","Previous studies have demonstrated superior cognitive function and information processing efficiency in elite athletes. However, most researchers drew such conclusions only by means of evaluating mean reaction times (RTs), which cannot be used to directly infer information processing efficiency in athletes. This impedes research development and practical cognitive science applications in the field of sports science. Here, we investigated differences in information processing capacity between elite soccer players and non-athletes by comparing mean reaction time and workload capacity evaluated using Systems Factorial Technology (SFT) (Townsend & Nozawa, 1995). A total of 27 first division soccer players and 26 controls from the general student population took part in the experiment. All participants were matched for weight, height, and age. A double-dot redundant-target task was adopted to examine the effect of visuo-spatial attention between the two groups. Further, event-related potential (ERP) was employed to explore the neural mechanisms underlying the responses. The behavioral findings demonstrated that soccer players exhibited faster reaction time than the controls, while no significant between-groups differences in workload capacity were found. In terms of ERPs, the results revealed a significantly shorter N1 latency for the soccer players compared to the controls, while such an effect was not observed for N1 amplitude. According to these findings, athletes practicing strategic sports may have superior processing speed while performing a visuo-spatial detection task. However, such cognitive superiority might not be associated with information processing capacity in this case. On the other hand, greater processing speed for soccer players may be inferred from the ERP results, which may explain why they had faster visuo-motor responses when performing the double-dot detection task. To summarize, this is study re-examined the cognitive superiority of athletes using a novel approach (i.e., SFT) along with ERP, and it is expected that this work may inspire researchers to further understand the role of cognition in sports from different perspectives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202109-202110040002-202110040002-265-284,63.3,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Adaptive Behavior Profiles and Their Association with Cognitive Ability and Symptom Severity in Children with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Pei-Wen Yeh, Tzu-Ling Lin, Chung-Hsin Chiang","high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD), intelligence quotient, severity, adaptive behavior","Purpose: This study explores the profiles of adaptive behaviors in school-going children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) and their relationship with intelligence quotient (IQ) and the severity of ASD symptoms. Methods: Sixty-eight seven-to 12-year-old children with HFASD were divided into intellectually gifted (IG_HFASD) and non-intellectually gifted (Non-IG_HFASD) groups based on their IQ. The groups' adaptive behaviors were compared by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition. The correlations between these behaviors and IQ as well as the severity of ASD symptoms were also examined in each group. Results: The IG_HFASD group performed significantly better than the Non-IG_HFASD group in the Communication domain. There were no differences between the groups in other domains of behavior. According to the observation assessment, the Non-IG_HFASD group had more repetitive/stereotypical behaviors than the IG_HFASD group. Among all the children, there was a positive correlation between IQ and the Communication domain, and a negative one between severity and Socialization domains. Examining the correlations in each group revealed that the IG_HFASD group had a moderately negative one between severity and the Daily Living as well as Socialization domains; no significant correlations were found between their IQ and any adaptive behaviors. In contrast, in the Non-IG_HFASD group, non-verbal intelligence was mainly associated with the Socialization domain. Conclusion: IQ is mainly associated with the Communication domain of adaptive behaviors in children with HFASD. The severity of ASD symptoms plays an important role in the Socialization domain and other subdomains. Notably, the two groups show distinct levels of correlations between adaptive behaviors and IQ as well as severity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202109-202110040002-202110040002-285-307,63.3,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Creativity in Design Thinking: Inspiring Sense-making and Thing-making,"Shyhnan Liou, Chia-Han Yang","cocreation, inspiration theory, complexity integration, design thinking, sense-making and thing-making","Design thinking is a creative method to wicked problem solution. However, the existing operational models lack of identifying mechanisms for creativity. An inspiration model was proposed in the study to illustrate the complexity integration of the divergence and convergence in problem exploration and solution development. The inspiration of problem exploration is sense making; the inspiration of solution development is thing-making. The ＂evoke-transcendence- action＂ mechanism of the inspiration model was adopted to describe the creative operation of sense-making and thing-making in design thinking. In the sense making of problem exploration, a design researcher comprehensively empathizes with the experience of a user. Through the systematic analysis of the content, history and context of the experience, the designer and the user may understand each other (evoke), and the story is presented through the narrative analysis. An understanding of the user's experience then leads to the insight of needs (transcendence), forming a specific definition of the problem (action). In the thing-making of solution development, through the interdisciplinary brainstorming (evoke), the promotion of growth mindset and polycultural attitudes in integrated research would liberate intellectual centrism and form a prototype of the aggregate multiple perspectives (transcendence), and further test (action) should be conducted for obtaining feedback and correction. In the study, mutual inspiration of knowledge co-creation was further proposed, stating how design research create progress with knowledge and forming the collective creativity of co-design.

Furthermore, app familiarity and exposure experience with icons have been considered key factors across icon studies. In this study, app familiarity was determined through a questionnaire of familiarity ratings to categorize app functions on a scale from high familiarity to low familiarity. As participants gained experience with the icon stimuli in the search task, icon frequency referred to participant performance before regular use in the first block (low frequency) and after regular use in the third block (high frequency). We investigated how app icon processing was affected by design style, app familiarity and icon familiarity. For the preference and memory tasks, we manipulated the design style (flat, skeuomorphic) and app familiarity (high, low). For the search task, design style, app familiarity, and icon frequency were manipulated. The target icon in each search trial was expressed through a spoken request to simulate users' regular interactions with app icons. The results revealed that skeuomorphic designs were associated with higher subjective preference, visual search for highly familiar apps, and correct rejection for less familiar app functions. In contrast, flat designs were superior only when searching for less familiar app functions in the high icon frequency conditions. Accordingly, the familiarity/novelty of app functions, design styles, and possible processes should also be considered when choosing icons for user interfaces.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202106-202107070002-202107070002-143-157,63.2,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The flat user interface design style, however, does not provide the affordance cues as readily as the skeuomorphic design and may also reduce visual interactions. It is not clear whether this difference may result in an effect on user clicking behavior on UI elements. Of particular interest is the usage of UI elements in web page banner ads, the estimation of ad performance and cost hinges on users' click through behavior. Important theoretical and practical implications are expected if the click through behavior and underlying psychological processes are indeed affected by the UI design for the call the action (CTA) information in banner ads. We conducted a simulated webpage reading experiment during which the eye position was tracked. The design of the CTA button in banner ads was manipulated to explore its effect on ad click-through behavior and whether this effect was due to users' mental simulation lengthening visual attentional deployment. The click-through rate and the total fixation duration (on ad) were both higher for ads comprising the skeuomorphic than the flat CTA buttons. Furthermore, these effects applied to the leisure viewing but not target directed viewing condition. The total fixation duration also significantly mediated the effect of UI design style.

Analysis of the Wayfinding Strategies of Pedestrians Using the Google Maps Mobile Application,"Meng-Ting Lin, Chun-Yu Lin","pedestrian navigation, Google Maps app, wayfinding strategy, individual differences","Following the advancements in public transportation and shared transport worldwide and the current prevalence of smartphones, a growing number of people are using navigation applications (apps) to find their way to their destination (i.e., ＂wayfinding＂) or travel between public transport transfers. Therefore, designing an effective and user-friendly navigation system and interface is worthy of exploration. Previous studies on navigation systems have mostly focused on automobile drivers. To optimize a navigation system designed specifically for pedestrians, this study attempted to identify the operating patterns and strategies of pedestrians while using the Google Maps app on a smart phone to determine which direction to take toward the target destination. Behavioral observation, interviews, and video recordings of app operation by users were used to analyze how each participant utilized and interacted with the app to reach real-world destinations. Subsequently, a hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to classify the collected data into six types of wayfinding strategies following which users determined their departure direction. The six categories are further detailed as follows: (A) Users observe the geographical relations between landmarks and the virtual routes on the digital map without rotating the phone or turning their body. (B) Users rotate the digital map to align the landmarks on the digital map with their real-world counterparts in the physical environment. (C) Users observe the geographical relation between the heading direction of the blue beam on the digital map and the virtual route without rotating the digital map or turning their body. (D) Users turn their body to align the heading direction of the blue beam with the final destination on the digital map. (E) Users turn their body to align the heading direction of the blue beam with their departure route. (F) Users turn their body to align the heading direction of the blue beam with their departure route and then rotate the departure direction on the digital map upward on the phone. The aforementioned findings provide a deeper understanding of pedestrian behaviors when using navigation apps for wayfinding. Furthermore, future research should compare different wayfinding strategies to make suggestions on personalized navigation interface designs, thus optimizing user experience in navigation apps.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202106-202107070002-202107070002-177-202,63.2,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Therefore, applying the knowledge and practice of clinical psychology to help them in returning to daily life as possible is a key issue. This article posits that in addition to physical treatment and symptoms control, there is a need for the palliative and hospice care system to emphasize the integration of the psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of the situation, thereby providing holistic care for patients and their family caregivers. A literature review was conducted to present the current status of research and clinical psychological services and to reflect the ＂biopsychosocial-spiritual＂ model. This model was then used to understand the needs and situations of ＂terminal patients＂ and their ＂family caretakers,＂ on which based-empirical studies of holistic clinical psychological interventions are proposed. Subsequently, a reflective critique was employed, proposing that the contributions of clinical psychology to palliative medicine or terminal care are based on the integration of knowledge and praxis through a process of assisting patients and their family members to transition from ＂having＂ to ＂being.＂ Knowledge as related objects (such as natural or artificial) is the essence of understanding practical activities (praxis). Hence, the process of converting ＂knowledge＂ to ＂being＂ is to disclose Dasein, the existence of human beings thrown into ＂being toward death＂.

Perceptual Grouping Strength can Modulate the Size of the Collinear Masking Effect in a Visual Search,"Yen-Ting Liu, Li Jingling","collinear masking effect, perceptual grouping, perceptual salience, visual search","Visual search efficiency can usually be promoted if the target is salient. However, Jingling & Tseng (2013) found that if the salient structure was composed of collinear bars, search would be more difficult - a phenomenon called the collinear masking effect. In their experiment, the collinear structure was composed of bars in a head-to-tail alignment. Thus, it is possible that perceptual grouping of the collinear distractor may play a role in the collinear masking effect. The current study aimed to reduce the strength of the perceptual grouping of the whole search display and to test whether the size of collinear masking effect also reduced. In Experiment 1, the scale of the bars (the size ratios of bars and spacing) was increased, and in Experiment 2, the spacing between bars was increased to reduce the grouping strength of the whole display. In Experiment 3, possible confounding of bar orientation of the target was removed. Our data showed that the strength of the collinear masking effect was indeed reduced because of the weakening of the perceptual grouping of the search display. Simply changing the orientation of the bar where target was on did not affect responses. We infer that the reduction of perceptual grouping strength of the whole display also reduced the grouping strength of collinear distractor, and hence the size of the effect. Therefore, collinearity grouping strength might be an important factor for the emergence of the collinear masking effect.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202103-202105050002-202105050002-1-21,63.1,2021,Chinese Journal of Psychology

While the neural efficiency hypothesis of intelligence has supporting evidence across cultures, electrophysiological responses associated with intelligence varied in children with different intellectual levels on various tasks. To test the hypothesis by components of the event-related field (ERF) on gifted children, we used a semantic-and-syntactic error detection task to study sentence processing in language comprehension. Three types of determiner-particle final sentences were presented visually to subjects in this magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiment: the congruent (a correct particle with a detection task), incongruent (an incorrect particle with a detection task), and filler (a correct particle followed by a word recall task) conditions. To detect different waveforms within and between the gifted group (GT) (N = 19) and non-gifted group (NG) (N = 15), the permutation t tests (iteration: 1000; p = .05; two tailed) were adopted to compare the ERF of the two groups. For the within group comparison, the NG group showed stronger amplitudes only around 600 ms, while the GT group had early components closed to 400 ms and the late time-window around 600ms. For the incongruent-subtract-filler comparison, a significant ERF difference was found between the two groups at a late time window around 650 ms in the right occipital channel. The topography revealed stronger current in the occipito-temporal region for the GT group during this time-window. In contrast, no statistically significant difference was found by comparing incongruent-subtract-congruent (IC) and congruent-subtract-filler (CF) conditions. Interestingly, this study showed that responses of gifted children had stronger magnetic current at a late time point compared to children with average IQ in the semantic-syntactic judgment task. These results indicate the complex task might engage deeper processing in a brain network and that gifted individuals show greater brain activation than their average peers.

However, the issue regarding how Chinese workers cope with these interpersonal stressors is still unclear and requires further clarification. Thus, we conducted three studies to clarify this issue. Study 1 adopted an inductive approach (N = 184) to explore the strategies of interpersonal stress coping in Chinese organizations. Study 2 developed a new Chinese interpersonal stress coping survey and used confirmatory factor analysis (N = 237) to examine its construct validity. Study 3 drew on the transactional process model to explore the relationships between the strategies of Chinese interpersonal stress coping and their antecedents and outcomes with a multilevel model (N = 170). The results revealed that Chinese workers used specific strategies to cope with interpersonal stress, including proactive resolution, patience, passive escape, and cognitive adaptation. Moreover, the results also demonstrated that relative power appraisal and relationship quality appraisal at event-level and harmony motives at the individual-level were related to different strategies of coping with interpersonal stress and that different coping strategies affect emotional exhaustion differently. Based on the research findings, we proposed a two-dimensional model (i.e., approach/avoidance, high/low energy investment) to explain the mechanisms underlying Chinese individuals' coping with interpersonal stress.

Reversion of the Kinetic Depth Effect: Interaction between Homogeneity and Familiarity,"Chieh Min, Shojiro Sakurai","depth inversion, kinetic depth effect, rotating mask illusion","The kinetic depth effect (KDE) (Wallach & O'Connell, 1953) is a phenomenon in which an observer can perceive 3D rotation from continuously presented 2D projection images. Each frame of a projected 2D image does not contain enough depth cues, so the direction of rotation is unstable in the KDE, and the object is perceived as spontaneously reversing (oscillating). Blackburn (2011) reviewed numerous studies and proposed that adding a temporal or spatial dimension may disambiguate the KDE. Klopfer (1991) used masks of the human face as stimuli in his experiment and found that the masks appeared to oscillate rather than rotate. This phenomenon may be attributed to the familiarity factor, in that observers are more familiar with convex faces than with concave faces. However, the familiarity factor could not explain the perceived reversal of non-face KDE stimuli. This study aimed to identify the general factors that can explain the reversal of rotating masks and non-face stimuli. We hypothesized that KDE stimuli reverse during the alternation of two depth appearances, and that nonhomogeneous features alternate more than homogeneous features. The rotating mask illusion may be attributed to its nonhomogeneity. In this study, Necker cubes and masks were used as stimuli in two experiments to discern whether the relationship between the homogeneity factor and the familiarity factor influences the number of KDE stimuli perceived to reverse. The results of the two experiments support the hypothesis that both the homogeneity factor and familiarity factor influence the perceived reversal of KDE stimuli.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202012-202101110001-202101110001-459-472,62.4,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Essays about stressful experiences written by 98 university students were evaluated by three trained raters on the frequencies of brooding, reflection, and problem-solving, along with the levels of negative emotions. Self-rated questionnaires, including the Chinese Response Style Questionnaire-short form, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales short form, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, and the satisfaction with life scale, were also conducted for comparison with the ratings from the content analysis. This content analysis method attained good inter-rater reliability and criterion-related validity. The analysis results supported the hypotheses that: (1) there is a relationship between two rumination subtypes, brooding and reflection; (2) brooding and reflection are both related to depressive emotions; (3) reflection is related to problem-solving, which indicated the possibility of the adaptiveness of reflection; (4) brooders had more negative emotions related to self-blame, which explains the maladaptiveness of brooding. Conclusions: The content analysis method measured ruminative responses and the adaptiveness of rumination. The method kept participants' attention in the given context and prevented them from distraction when they presented their ruminative responses. These advantages might make the content analysis method surpass self-rated questionnaires when measuring rumination. This preliminary study on ruminative content, which had previously been insufficiently examined, provides future directions for improving the measure of rumination.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202012-202101110001-202101110001-497-517,62.4,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Effect Size Reporting Practices in Taiwanese Psychology and Education Journals: Review and Beyond,"Li-Ting Chen, Qi-Wen Ding, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Yi-Kai Chen, Yu-Shan Chiang, Ssu-Ching Huang, Tong-Rong Yang, Che Cheng, Pey-Yan Liou, Chao-Ying Joanne Peng","clinical significance, statistical inference, effect size, reporting practice, practical significance","The importance of reporting effect sizes (ESs) in quantitative empirical studies has been emphasized in the literature. However, no published study to date has shed light on current ES reporting practices in Taiwanese psychology and education journals. To fill this gap, the present study systematically reviewed 268 articles published in eight Taiwanese psychology journals and nine education journals during 2017 and 2018. All of these 17 journals were highly ranked in their respective fields. Four aspects of ES reporting practices were investigated: (A) the ES reporting rate, (B) the ES type, (C) the ES interpretation, and (D) the resolution of discrepancies between the ES magnitude and statistical significance. The results revealed that 72% of articles reported at least one ES, and more than 65% of ESs reported were the r-type, such as Pearson's r and η^2. Of the studies that reported ESs, 55% also interpreted the ESs. More than 80% of these interpretations were the mere labeling of an ES as small, medium, or large, according to established benchmarks. Approximately 50% of the articles showed a discrepancy between the magnitude of an ES and its corresponding statistical significance, but only 35% of these articles attempted to explain or resolve the discrepancy. When the data for psychology and education articles were analyzed separately, the psychology articles exhibited a lower rate of both ES reporting and ES interpretation by labeling. In sum, the majority of articles reported at least one ES, but few interpreted ES fully or meaningfully. To assist authors with a full and meaningful ES reporting, we offer five suggestions and one exemplary ES reporting in the Extended Abstract. It is hoped that this paper contributes to an increased practice of meaningfully reporting ES(s) in empirical quantitative studies in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202012-202101110001-202101110001-553-592,62.4,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to examine the psychometric properties of the DPICS IV in a clinically referred Taiwanese sample of children aged 3-11 and their caregivers, (2) to provide normative data for this population, and (3) to examine normative age differences. A total of 104 Taiwanese clinically referred caregiver-child dyads completed the pre-treatment assessment for Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. Parent-report measures completed by the caregivers, as well as the DPICS IV observational data, were used for analysis. The DPICS IV had good inter-observer reliability and adequate discriminant, convergent and divergent validity for some DPICS IV indicators, including negative talk in child-led play and child compliance in parent-led play and clean-up. Differences were noted in parent-child interactions assessed by the DPICS IV based on the child’s age. The results of this study highlight good psychometrics for the DPICS IV in a clinically referred Taiwanese sample, and its established normative data can provide performance reference on the DPICS IV for this population. Future studies are needed to examine the test-retest reliability and predictive validity of the DPICS IV and to establish its normative data and psychometric properties with a non-referred Taiwanese sample.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202009-202010290003-202010290003-321-354,62.3,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Effect of Power Source and Conflict Coping Strategy on Marital Relationships,Yuh-Huey Jou,"conflict-coping strategy, power sources, marital quality, patterns of marital power","This study explored the marital power from the spouses' perception and the perspective of power source-process outcome, distinguished the patterns of power source among couples, and examined whether the effects of dyadic power source patterns on marital quality was different due to the conflict-coping strategy and the gender. Data were collected from 342 married couples in Greater Taipei area. The measurement included six sources of power (referent, coercive, reward, expert, informational and legitimate powers) reported by the spouse, conflict-coping strategies (dialogic, evasive and controversial strategies by second order factor analysis), marital quality (satisfaction and regret), and control variables. The main results showed that (1) husbands perceived their wives had higher coercive, reward, expert and legitimate powers, and wives evaluated their husbands had higher informational power. Wives used more controversial strategy then husbands, while husbands reported higher levels of marital quality than wives. (2) The dyadic power source patterns could be identified as Husband Authority, Dual Multiple Powers, Husband Knowledgeable and Wife Knowledgeable. The four patterns had proportions of about 9%, 24%, 24% and 43%, respectively. (3) The results of hierarchical linear models showed that the Dual Multiple Powers couples reported the highest marital quality than the other three. Couples who used higher dialogic, lower evasive, or lower controversial strategy had better marital quality. Moreover, the interaction terms of gender and dyadic power source pattern and conflict-coping strategy showed significant effects on marital quality.

The Perception of Facial Beauty: The Contribution of Image Statistics and Perceived Symmetry,"Pi-Chun Huang, Chien-Chung Chen","symmetry perception, image statistics, facial attractiveness","The judgement of facial beauty was influenced by many factors. In current study, we investigated how the image statistics (including slope of amplitude spectrum and symmetry index) and perceived symmetry influenced facial attractiveness. 228 faces were normalized to the same rms contrast and modified to produce its symmetrical face and asymmetrical face by morphing technique. The task of the observers was to rate each face for its attractiveness, perceived symmetry, valence and arousal in the emotion dimension. In Experiment 1, we used symmetrical and asymmetrical faces as stimuli. Our results showed that the symmetrical face has higher values of symmetry index and slope, and was rated as more attractive, symmetrical and with higher positive emotion. Furthermore, the facial attractiveness could be predicted by symmetry index, slope, perceived symmetric and emotional valence by linear regression. In Experiment 2, we used original faces and asked other participants to do the same task. The results were similar to Experiment 1. The attractiveness rating for randomly chosen faces could be also predicted by the rest of the faces by using the same parameter weights in linear regression. We also adapted path analysis to investigate how the physical properties (symmetry index and slope) influences participants' attractiveness rating via perceived symmetry and emotion judgement. Our results suggested the beauty of the faces was contributed by the image statistics, perceived symmetry and valence of the emotion.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202009-202010290003-202010290003-421-440,62.3,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Attentional Focus for Novices in a Mirror-Drawing Task,"Hsi-Sheng Chen, Li Jingling","transfer, Attention focus, mirror drawing task, motor learning, novice","Focus of attention can affect motor learning efficiency. In particular, external focus, i.e. focus on the consequence of actions, was shown to improve learning speed and learning retention more than internal focus, which is focus on the action per se. Previous studies suggest that external focus can avoid interference with automatic action control and thus improve motor learning. Meanwhile, some theories on motor learning suggest that a novice should first coordinate action components, which implies that internal focus, rather than external focus, may be critical for novice. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of attentional focus in a mirror drawing task. The mirror drawing task is rare in daily life and relies on eye-hand coordination, and therefore is selected to probe novice in motor learning in this study. The external focus group was instructed to follow their drawing behavior from the mirror, while the internal focus group to feel their wrist during drawing. Two experiments were carried out. Experiment 1 showed significant improvement of mirror drawing speed from one trial experience; however, no significant difference was observed between external and internal groups. Nevertheless, correlation analyses indicated that external focus group showed more consistent response speed across two trials than the internal group. Experiment 2 asked participants to practice 15 times for the first day, and tested retention and transfer at the second day. Results showed that after practice, external focus group completed drawing faster than internal focus group in the last 5 practice trials, as well as in the transfer test. Our results thus replicated that external focus can facilitate motor learning. For novices who were in the coordination stage, there was no evidence showing that internal focus of attention can facilitate motor learning.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202009-202010290003-202010290003-441-458,62.3,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Mention to the research achievement, various of theoretical concepts and empirical evidences have been accumulated and published. Follow - up ＂gratitude＂ research has been applied and extended from the general situation to the specific situation, such as some sports psychologists join the gratitude research. In the initial stages, the ＂gratitude in sport field＂ research had been questioned and ignored due to gratitude could not improve the athlete' energy and performance soon and directly. Fortunately, gratitude has been acknowledged and valued gradually due to it brings athletes' an additional function ＂psychologically healthier＂ beside prime goals ＂Faster - Higher - Stronger＂ all athletes pursue. This article aims to re-examine study results from specific sports gratitude on the analogy of general situation gratitude, and emphasize the characteristics and contributions of gratitude in the context of sports. This article is divided into three parts: the first part introduces the theoretical concept, measurement tool of gratitude, and then clarify contemporary theory underpinning the relationship between gratitude and athletes' well-being. Some intervention that aim to enhance the effects of gratitude on well-being are also reviewed. The second part is about a systematic review of the psychological process and theoretical boundaries of gratitude in sport psychology in particular during two stages of initial germination and development. The third part, finally, we propose a breakthrough about gratitude in sport psychology different from gratitude in general situation. Though Faster - Higher - Stronger is presented as the golden ideal in sport, some scholars (including us) have attempted to introduce concepts from positive psychology such as gratitude because we believe that optimal performance depends on psychological health as well as physical health.

Review of Sedentary Behaviors and Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults,"Po-Wen Ku, Shang-Ti Chen, Wen-Jung Sun, Li-Jung Chen","prolonged sitting, depression, inactivity, Aging, follow-up study","Depression is a common mental problem and is also a leading cause of disability, which serves as an important contributor to the overall global burden of disease. It may lead to serious consequences including increased risk of morbidity and mortality. This warrants the need to identify correlates such as modifiable lifestyle behaviors that can prevent or delay the onset of depressive symptoms in aging populations. Sedentary behaviors such as TV viewing, reading, mobile phone/computer use, social chatting, and passive transport etc. are prevalent among older adults. Unfortunately, sedentary behaviors have been increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for different health outcomes. Although the link between sedentary behaviors and several geriatric health outcomes including all-cause mortality, cardio-metabolic diseases and obesity in later life has been established, the associations of sedentary behaviors with depressive symptoms have not been comprehensively investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to provide a narrative review by scrutinizing the recent epidemiologic evidence for prospective cohort studies of sedentary behaviors and depressive symptoms in older adults. To fulfill the aim, the following issues were raised and analyzed in an effort to disentangle the complex relationships between late-life sedentary behaviors and depressive symptoms. First, the prevalence and correlates of geriatric depressive symptoms were presented and discussed. Second, the definition of sedentary behaviors and the prevalence of late-life sedentary behaviors were described. Third, the relevant issues of measuring sedentary behaviors were addressed. Fourth, the effects of sedentary behaviors on various health outcomes were identified. Fifth, the prospective studies regarding sedentary behaviors and depressive symptoms in older adults were examined based on epidemiological perspectives. Sixth, based on the preceding information, research gaps in the literature were identified and discussed. Conclusions and suggestions for future research on this topic were proposed. Based on limited evidence, late-life sedentary behaviors are associated with higher risk of depressive symptoms. Future studies on the current topic are recommended to conduct large-scale prospective cohort studies with multiple waves of data collection employs a combination of subjective and objective measures of sedentary behaviors, such as a questionnaire and accelerometry, by which studies could explore the bi-directional relationships of different types of sedentary behaviors with depressive symptoms in older adults and the mechanism between them.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202006-202006180001-202006180001-151-170,62.2,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Mind in Sports: Contemporary Issues and Future Trends,Chun-Hao Wang,"athletes, sports, cognitive science, neuroscience","Cognitive and neuroscience science has been a promising approach in sport psychology. In particular, there has been increased attention given to the role of mind in sports. Although most empirical studies have pointed out the importance of cognitive function supporting sports expertise, the generalizability of current findings to applications in field settings has been limited, which may be due in part to lacking of a comprehensive review and practical guide on this topic. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review to discuss the published literature regarding sports and cognitive neuroscience so as to understand the past and present in this field. This review then discussed the potential mechanisms explaining the existing research findings from the point of view from current hypothesis/models. Despite some inconsistency, the review of most of the previous studies reveals that individual differences in cognitive functioning may be related to sports type, expertise level, and playing position. Further, higher-order cognitive functions such executive functions or inhibition have been demonstrated to predict sporting performance. Despite these promising findings, the discrepancy in findings and the adaption of low ecologically valid experimental condition as well as cross-sectional design may impede the real-world application of research findings.

We only considered papers published in international journals and TSSCI journals. Results: The results of this review can be summarized in five points: (a) most Taiwanese scholars conducted their research in sport contexts; (b) most of the studies used undergraduates and adolescents as participants; (c) most scholars adopted quantitative methods to conduct their research, and the studies published in international journals had a higher proportion of longitudinal designs than those published in TSSCI journals; (d) 34 (17.71%) studies examined the issue of ＂interpersonal relationship in sport＂; 51 (26.56%) studies investigated ＂leadership and group dynamics＂; 74 (38.54%) investigated ＂motivation＂; 107 (55.73%) investigated ＂social cognition in sport＂; and 67 (34.90%) investigated the ＂influence of the environment＂; and (e) among the studies published in international journals, 24 (28.57%) were ranked as Q1, 17 (20.24%) as Q2, 30 (35.71%) as Q3; and 13 (15.48%) as Q4. Discussion and suggestion: Future research may examine how social facilitation influences athletes and exercisers' behavior. Issues such as audience effect or home-court advantage are worth investigating. We also suggest that future studies may adopt cross-cultural or cross-ethnic designs. In addition, we suggest that future studies adopt multi-samples, multi-measures, and multi-timing data collection.

Sports teams have several characteristics that make them suitable for the study of TL and PL. These two types of leadership derive from Max Weber's two types of domination authority: charismatic domination and traditional domination, respectively. TL and PL styles may be close to coaching leadership practices. This review critically examines empirical and qualitative studies of TL and PL in sport settings. We consider definitions of leadership styles, coaching from the perspective of leadership theory, the origin and development of the leadership theory in sport, and the main findings on this topic. Common topics in studies of TL in sport are its consequences, qualitative case TL, measurement of authentic TL, and youth sport TL. Common topics in studies of PL are its consequences, types of leadership, the leadership process, and combination paternalistic study. We compare the studies of TL and PL in sport leadership and highlight avenues for advancing research on TL and PL in sports. We make the following suggestions for future studies. To improve research and practice, randomized experiments, interventions, and action research are required. At the conceptual level, it is necessary to refine the definitions of TL and PL in sports contexts.

In accordance with the value of filial piety in Chinese family, this study investigated that adult children's endorsement of filial belief and relating autonomy capacity, which maintain parent-child connection and practice filial piety, contributes to perceive the extent to which children can be securely attached and its further effect on elderly life adaptation. Analyzing intergenerational dyadic data constituted by 100 adult children (mean age was 37.88 years; 60% female) and 158 elderly parents (mean age was 66.99 years; 52% female) with hierarchical liner modeling, the main results showed that (1) adult children's endorsement of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety belief, as well as their relating autonomy, facilitated elderly parents perceiving the extent to which children can be securely attached; (2) elderly parents perceiving higher extent to which children can be securely attached was associated with lower frequency of depression but higher meaning of life and satisfaction of personal freedom; and (3) adult children's reciprocal filial belief, authoritarian filial belief, and relating autonomy, decreased their elderly parents' frequency of depression but increased meaning of life and satisfaction of personal freedom, through the mediating effect of elderly parents perceiving the extent to which children can be securely attached. The theoretical implications of these findings, as well as limitations and future directions, were discussed comprehensively at the end.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202003-202003300001-202003300001-1-29,62.1,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Efficacy of Attention Bias Modification for Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder: Using Emotional Attention Network Test as an Evaluation of the Underlying Mechanism,"Yu-Ming Hou, Min-Hung Teng, Sue-Hwang Chang","attentional bias, ANT, attention control, ABM, generalized anxiety disorder","Attention bias modification (ABM) can correct the attention bias of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and improve their symptoms. However, the therapeutic mechanism of ABM is poorly understood (Macleod & Clarke, 2015). In this study, 28 patients (18 women and 10 men; average age = 46.04 years) with GAD were recruited. In addition, 28 healthy people (22 women and 6 men; average age = 45.43 years) were recruited as the control group. All participants were randomly assigned to either the ABM group (receiving neutral stimuli for attention training) or the placebo-training group (receiving no specific stimuli). Before and after training, both groups received two types of attention network test (ANT)-the standard ANT and the emotion ANT (e-ANT)-to assess changes in the alerting network, the orienting network, and the executive control network of the participants; e-ANT, in which threatening and neutral words serve as clues, is used to assess alertness to neutral or threatening stimuli as well as orientations, from neutral to threatening and from threatening to neutral stimuli. The results indicated that the attention allocation of the patients with GAD was inflexible. Compared with the control group, the patients' conflict-monitoring abilities were unsatisfactory. Moreover, the patients were significantly highly alert to symbols, neutral stimuli, and threatening stimuli. Compared with the control group, shifting attention from threatening stimuli to neutral stimuli was more difficult for patients with GAD. After receiving training (of any type), the ability of patients with GAD to shift their attention from threatening stimuli to neutral stimuli improved significantly, possibly because the participants responded strategically during attention training. These results clarify the processes underlying attention bias in patients with GAD as well as the relationship between such processes and ABM, from the perspectives of the alerting, orienting, and executive control networks proposed by Posner.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202003-202003300001-202003300001-51-72,62.1,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Facial Emotion Recognition and Its Relationships with Neurocognition and Theory of Mind in Schizophrenia,"Yung-Li Ku, Ming-Teng Lin","theory of mind, social cognition, neurocognition, schizophrenia, facial emotion recognition","The present study aimed at clarifying the relationships among neurocognition (attention/vigilance, working memory, reasoning and problem solving), facial emotion recognition and theory of mind in patients with schizophrenia. Participants were 106 patients with schizophrenia recruited from two medical institutes in north Taiwan. Participants completed the Short Version of Chinese Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III, Conners' Continuous Performance Task- II (CPT-II), the Chinese Wechsler Memory Scale-III, Working Memory Index subtests (WMI), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), the Japanese and Caucasian Facial Expression of Emotion (JACFEE), and the Chinese Theory of Mind Tasks, including Faux Pas, implication stories, and non-verbal task. Structural equation modeling technique with path analyses indicated that, under the control of age and the general intelligence, except for working memory from the WMI, attention/vigilance from the CPT-II and reasoning and problem solving from the WCST respectively influenced facial emotion recognition from the JACFEE, which in turn influenced three tasks of theory of mind. These results can be interpreted as providing evidences to support the hypotheses of this study. The conclusions of this study are attention/ vigilance and reasoning and problem solving are important ingredients of facial emotion recognition.

"Image-based Approach to Face Recognition: Effects of Line-drawn Faces, Pigmentation and Shading, and Spatial Frequency","Jisien Yang, Gary C.-W. Shyi","image-based research, spatial frequency, Face recognition model, shape from shadow","The vast number of studies in face recognition have gradually evolved into three major approaches, namely, the image-based, structure-based, and function-based approach. Studies under the category of image-based approach are concerned with image-level face information, such as edge, spatial frequency, pigmentation, shading and shadow. Researchers manipulate these factors and examine the roles they may play in face recognition. In contrast, those ascribed to the structure-based approach are concerned with the effect of featural, configural, and holistic information on face recognition. Researchers adopting this approach consider faces as decomposable objects and explain face processing in terms of structural descriptions. Finally, studies under the third approach investigate face recognition from a functional perspective, where the main issues concern how humans extract biological as well as social information from faces that are pertinent to social interactions, such as identity, gender, age, race, and emotional expression, among others. In this review, we first discuss the differences between these three approaches, and then focus our review in details on the findings accrued within the image-based approach. Our goal is to provide an integrated overview of the image-based approach and emphasize the importance of image-based processing in understanding face recognition. Specifically, our review highlights how basic processing of image information such as border, spatial frequency, pigmentation, may lay the critical foundation for the later processing of the structural and functional aspects of a face.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-202003-202003300001-202003300001-99-127,62.1,2020,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Experimental and Cognitive Psychology in Taiwan- Observing the Case of the Department of Psychology at NTU,"Jong-Tsun Huang, Shojiro Sakurai, Man-Ying Wang","indigenous research, experimental and cognitive psychology, Taihoku Imperial University, National Taiwan University, international academic interaction","This article celebrates the 60^(th) anniversary of the publication of the Chinese Journal of Psychology (CJP, previously the Acta Psychological Taiwanica) by providing a selective overview of experimental and cognitive psychology issues in Taiwan. The discussion is limited within the context of the Department of Psychology at National Taiwan University (NTU) where CJP was first published and continued for a long time. Under this context, we first looked into the dawning age of experimental psychology in Taiwan. Upon the launch of Taihoku Imperial University, the seventh of the Japanese Imperial Universities in series, in 1928, Taipei, Taiwan, a number of psychological research apparatus were acquired to echo with the then internationally trendy German Gestalt psychology thoughts and experimentation. However, this early start of experimental psychology in Taiwan was soon replaced by the subsequent research emphasis on the specifics of Taiwanese aborigines due to a Southern Expansion Policy of Japan. The research on Taiwanese aborigines was continued by the Department of Psychology at NTU after the replacement of Japanese rule by the current government. The experimental psychology research regained access to topics of international influence and indigenous uniqueness (e.g., the study of the cognitive processing of Chinese characters). An international research trend was gradually formed in Taiwan. This article examined research by the Department of Psychology at NTU on visual perception, cognitive processing of Chinese characters, attention and memory, behavioral decision making and others. The experimental psychology in Taiwan has been evolved to accommodate both international research trends as well as those highlighting indigenously meaningful topics. The Chinese Journal of Psychology will continue to play a critical role on these emerging studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201912-202002030001-202002030001-295-319,61.4,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology

We present findings to suggest that the hippocampus is involved not only in representing the context of conditioning but also in associating it to an electric shock. The hippocampal GABAergic and cholinergic systems mediated the context representation and context-shock association respectively. These findings demand revising the prevailing model of contextual fear conditioning: In short, the brain may store two engrams for the context-shock association in such conditioning, one relying on the amygdala for a simple reflexive association of CS and US, while the other on the hippocampus for combinatorial binding of all cues in a conditioning episode.

A Holistic Model of Hospice Palliative Care for Counseling Psychologists,"Ping-Hwa Chen, Yi-Huei Huang","hospice palliative care, counseling psychologists, bio-psycho-social-cultural-spiritual holistic care model, multi-culture, spiritual care","The development of hospice palliative care in Taiwan has a thirty-year history. Although the need of providing a holistic hospice palliative care for patients and their families has gradually been recognized, it still has a long way to go to fully put it into clinical practice. Traditionally, counseling psychologists are well trained to provide psycho-social evaluations and interventions for the clients. But for terminally ill patients, they need a bio-psycho-social-cultural-spiritual holistic care, including pain control and symptom management, care for social and spiritual needs, and culturally appropriate interventions. A majority of counseling psychologists who work with terminally ill patients and their families still lack the knowledge and training in this holistic approach to palliative care. In the present article, authors reviewed past research literature and compiled them into five themes, including: 1. the bio-psycho-social-cultural-spiritual holistic care model for hospice palliative patients, 2. the professional competencies required for palliative care counseling psychologists, 3. the role and function of palliative care counseling psychologists, 4. the salient religious and spiritual needs of palliative care patients, and 5. the multicultural competencies of caring for patients and their families from diverse cultural backgrounds. After literature review, the authors proposed five suggestions for future counseling psychologists who will work with palliative patients and family members. Suggestions included: 1. To develop and research the bio-psycho-social-cultural-spiritual holistic care model in clinical practice, 2. To enhance palliative counseling psychologists' professional competencies by receiving more educational trainings, 3. To promote palliative counseling psychologists' roles and functions by the collaboration between educational institutes and professional organizations, 4. To strengthen counseling psychologists' proficiencies of caring for palliative patients' spiritual needs, 5. To become competent palliative counseling psychologists working with patients from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

Learning and Instruction are the Backbone of Educational Psychology,Hwa-Wei Ko,"social construction, domain relevant, educational psychology","Educational psychology involves the study of how people learn and the instructional process in order to know more about how to help people learn best. There is a tradition for education to lean on learning theories from psychology, for early psychological studies such as memory and practice caught the eyes of educators. Nevertheless, psychology theory focused more on individual learning process and was domain general. It is almost impossible to satisfy the complex educational system where individual difference and diversity is the norm. In this thesis, the author went back to the mid-1960 when cognitive psychologists explored the processes of learning different content domains and social construction was introduced to form instructional designs. Then the emergence of educational technology and cooperative, collaborative learning prevailed in the research. It seems that educational psychology has established its discipline. However, after examining the educational psychology textbooks, the fact is that most of them do not catch up with the trend, neither the cognitive process of domain content learning nor the collaborative learning. It is argued that the content of textbooks should be revised and even altered to meet the trend in order to make a way for future teacher's professional development of learning and instruction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201912-202002030001-202002030001-417-438,61.4,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Positivism vs. Realism: Philosophical Foundations for Constructing Theories in Indigenous Psychology,Kwang-Kuo Hwang,"transcendental idealism, radical empiricism, phenomenon, thing-in-itself, ontology","Positivism advocated radical empiricism for its ontology and argued that the only reality is what can be experienced by one's sensory organs. The only legitimate way for a scientist to recognize objects in the world is through their representations in his mind. It is unnecessary for scientists to seek the ultimate cause that creates the objective world beyond sensory experience. Such radical empiricism advocates for an epistemological view, believing that scientific theories represent truth. Therefore, Schlick (1936) proposed a famous statement that was followed by most logical positivists: ＂The meaning of a proposition is the method for its verification＂ (Schlick, 1936). In contrast, evolutionary epistemology adopts the ontology of ＂realism,＂ which assumes that there exists an ontological reality beyond our sensory experience. A scientist has to construct a theory to describe the objective world by conjecturing about the nature of its noumena. According to the transcendental idealism proposed by Kant and the various versions derived from it. The goal of scientific activities is the construction of theoretical models to depict the natural order. Hence theoretical models are constructed by scientists, and though they might be independent from any particular individual, they cannot be independent from the scientific community. Because the noumenon of an object for study is transcendent, any scientific theory constructed by a scientist is just an approximation to the truth, but not truth itself. Therefore, it must be examined by members of a scientific community through various methods. Its methodology is falsification but not verification. In order to resolve the difficulties encountered in their theoretical construction, Indigenous psychologists have to adjust their mentality form positivism to realism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201912-202002030001-202002030001-439-456,61.4,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Cognitive Abilities in the Game of Go during the Opening, Middle, and Endgame Phases: When Experimental Psychology Meets Artificial Intelligence","Der-Yow Chen, Chi-Lin Yu, Ching-Wen Su, Kuan-Hung Liao, Hsiang-Yun Hsiao","calculation ability, game of Go, spatial ability, logical reasoning, artificial intelligence","The game of Go, also called Weiqi or Baduk, is one of the most sophisticated board games in the world. The players compete with each other by surrounding more territory using their stones. There are three phases in a game of Go, including the opening, middle, and endgame. Only a very few psychological studies have investigated the underlying processes or neural mechanisms used while playing Go. It has been suggested that some cognitive abilities may be important during the game, but the recruitment of different kinds of cognitive abilities in three phases is still unknown. The present study addressed this issue by combining experimental psychology approaches and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Twenty-four Go players tried their best to quickly answer 48 Go questions in each of three phases, with different cognitive interference tasks appearing simultaneously. Their accuracy and reaction time on these questions were recorded as their performance. The Go questions were designed and organized by a professional Go player, and some basic requirements for psychological experiments were met. In addition to a control task, there were three types of interference tasks: a visual spatial search, logical reasoning, and calculation. The results showed that the spatial interference task decreased the accuracy in the opening phase, suggesting that spatial ability is the most important cognitive ability used in the opening of a Go game. The logical reasoning interference task decreased the accuracy in the middle and endgame phases, implying that reasoning ability is very critical in these phases. The calculation task had a less significant interference effect. In addition, we used three AI-related algorithms to classify the subjects' performance in the three phases of Go questions under different degrees of cognitive interference. The results showed that these algorithms had much better than chance accuracy to correctly classify the performance in three different phases of Go questions or under different degrees of cognitive interference. Cross validation procedures ensured the generalizability, and permutation tests also indicated that the predictive accuracy of these models was statistically significant. We thus argue that there are indeed different cognitive representations in these three phases under different levels of interference. In summary, in the present study, an experimental approach was adopted to reveal the involvement of cognitive abilities in three phases of Go. In addition, we provide a new perspective for experimental psychology by introducing an AI-related analysis of multivariate data, which infers that artificial intelligence can have a greater influence and make a greater contribution to the understanding of psychology and human intelligence.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201909-201910040001-201910040001-173-196,61.3,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology

A Text Analysis Approach to Analyzing Gender Differences in Breakup Posts on Social Media,"Lee-Xieng Yang, Ching-Fan Sheu","gender differences, text analysis, social media, stylometric analysis","Two approaches to text analysis have been applied in the current work to investigate gender differences in breakup posts on social media in Taiwan. First, we calculated the probabilities of the types of words, such as personal pronoun and other word categories based on the Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count(LIWC), occurring in the posts to predict author's gender. The results showed that personal pronoun outperformed other word types at predicting gender for social media break-up posts. Second, we conducted stylometric analysis on these posts to extract keywords for different gender. The occurring probabilities of these keywords were then used to predict the author's gender of the post. The results showed that including keywords in the top one percent as predictors enabled a model to perform better than the first approach. A network analysis was carried out, respectively, for each gender to examine the psychological and linguistic features of these keywords and their relationship with reference to the Chinese LIWC. The typical features, defined in terms of the centrality indices, such as word types of verb, adverb, relative, social process, biological process and cognitive mechanism were found to be common for both gender. However, features of affection words, sexual words, and negate words showed up only for breakup posts authored by females.

DeepLEX: Toward a Knowledge-yielding Approach and Resource for AI,"Shu-Kai Hsieh, Yu-Hsiang Tseng","semantic representation, computational lexicon, dialogue system, AI","Deep learning and neural network has gained substantial progress in recent years. After the introduction of word embeddings, a form of distributional vector semantics, computers could better simulate the lexical semantic relationships between words. However, the hierarchical nature of human language and concepts are still difficult to modeled by current approach. In computational linguistics, researchers developed lexical resources from different theoretical perspectives. These language resources attempt to bridge the gap between syntagmatic relationships, which computers can readily modeled from data, and paradigmatic knowledge, that are not readily grasped by computers. These knowledge are essential for the capability to reason in an unfamiliar context with only few data, and are also vital to develop empathy of human emotions. The commonality of these capabilities involves the high context variance, in which individual, social and cultural context intertwined, render a great challenge for computers to learn in a data-hungry way. Current study considers, as one would argue in computational functional linguistics, lexicon as an explicit knowledge base of human language. It is human annotation aided by automatic extraction the essential building block of strong artificial intelligence. Moreover, the knowledge stored in lexicon not only contains the pairing between forms and meanings, it should also address the fluidity of formulae and the dynamics between form-meaning pairings. The goal of current study is thus to integrate and develop a novel lexicon model called DeepLex that includes multilevel lexical properties, such as linguistic, psychological and pedagogical. A web-based tool is also developed to help users to freely determine and annotate formulae in Chinese. Further applications of DeepLex is also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201909-201910040001-201910040001-231-247,61.3,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology

If they cannot properly deal with an interpersonal problem, it will be difficult for them to complete their job tasks. Understanding the meaning and influence of interpersonal stressors is more important than job stressors for Chinese workers. Although some researchers have conducted studies about interpersonal stressors in the Western context, the results cannot be generalized to non-Western societies. Researchers have suggested that considering cultural values in interpersonal stressor research is a critical factor to solve this dilemma. Thus, this study adopts an inductive approach to offer a comprehensive definition of interpersonal stressors in Confucius-based societies. This study collects the interpersonal stressful incidents within the organiztions by Critical Incident Technique. 84 workers responded 272 descriptive interpersonal incidents. Interpersonal stressors include nine dimensions are found in this study. Four dimensions are etic dimesions and five dimension are emic dimensions.

Does Authoritarian Leadership Lead to Bad Outcomes? A Contingency Perspective,"Yu-Hung Cheng, Wan-Ju Chou, Te-Hsien Chou, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","authoritarian leadership, sport team, effort, contingency theory, goal orientation","Previous studies on the sports team have mainly focused on the common phenomenon that coaches take strict control to require players to work hard in training. Many researchers have explored this phenomenon from the theoretical perspective of authoritarian leadership. Although these studies have accumulated preliminary results, they are mostly limited to qualitative interviews, but not directly examine the relationship between coaches' authoritarian leadership style and players' effort. Therefore, whether the authoritarian leadership can really encourage the players to put more efforts in training is still a puzzle and an important research void. In order to fulfill this void, this study adapts the dual dimensional model of authoritarian leadership, dividing authoritarian leadership into dominance-focus authoritarian leadership and discipline-focus authoritarian leadership. Also, taking the perspective of leadership contingency theory, we propose that player's goal orientation is an important boundary condition. According to the data of 348 college players, discipline-focus authoritarian leadership enhances the player's hard work; and the impact becomes nonsignificant when the player has a high avoid performance goal orientation or a high prove performance goal orientation.

Revisiting the Extended Present Hypothesis: Chinese Speakers' Perception of Time,"Shuping Huang, Jenn-Yeu Chen","extended present, cross-cultural psychology, time perception, time orientation","A recent study by Chen, Su, and O'Seaghdha (2013) found that Chinese speakers maintain an extended present time frame in which the present lasts for a longer duration compared to English participants, and that Chinese speakers tend to perceive past and future events as ongoing. We tested this Extended Present Hypothesis further with Cottle's Circle Test and the Duration Inventory. The Circle Test showed that when native Chinese speakers drew three circles representing the present, past, and future, 66.7% of the circles overlap one another, with the present in the middle bridging the past and the future. In the Duration Inventory Test, native Chinese speakers viewed the present as lasting from seconds, minutes and hours. This contrasted with results of English speakers, which showed the present to last for just seconds. These results are consistent with the Extended Present Hypothesis in terms of its two postulations: the elongated present and integrated time. Beyond their postulations, the present study extends the Hypothesis to nonlinguistic frames, arguing that linguistic difference may not be the only influence, and that cultural practices should be taken into account for better explanations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201906-201907030002-201907030002-131-150,61.2,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Asian or Caucasian? Exploring the Development of Race Categorization in Taiwanese School-Aged Children Using a Morphing Face Paradigm,"Chun-Man Chen, Yu-Shao Kuo, Sarina Hui-Lin Chien","school-age children, race categorization, face perception, other-race effect (ORE)","The broadly defined other-race effect (ORE) refers to differential processing for own- and other-race faces, such as own-race face recognition advantage and categorization bias for racially ambiguous faces. The present study adopted bi-racial (East Asian and Caucasian) morph face images as stimuli, aiming to explore the development of race categorization in Taiwanese school-age children and adults. In Experiment 1, we tested 33 adults (17 females) on their race categorization of Asian/White morphed faces. In Experiment 2, we tested 65 school-age children (34 girls), divided into three age groups, 7-8 year-olds (N = 21), 9-10 year-olds (N = 22), and 11-12 year-olds (N = 22), with the same task. The morphed face stimuli contained 11 levels (from A100/C0 (100% Asian) to A0/C100 (100% White) in 10% increment); both children and adults were asked to categorize each of the morphed faces as either Asian or Caucasian. The results showed that, as the Asian face component increased, the participants were more likely to categorize the morphed face as Asian. Importantly, for the 50% Asian/White racially ambiguous faces: 7-8 year-olds categorized the faces as Asian whereas 9-10 year-olds, 11-12 year-olds, and adults categorized the face as White. Moreover, the reaction times for the morphed faces of nearly equal Asian and White components (e.g., A50/C50 or A60/C40) were the longest among all, indicating that those faces were rather difficult to categorize. Lastly, we adopted curve fitting (using a 4-parameter sigmoidal function) to estimate individuals’ threshold of the Asian component for categorizing as ＂Asian.＂ The adults' group mean threshold was 56.01%; the group mean thresholds of 7-8, 9-10, and 11-12 year-olds were 49.52%, 54.27%, and 53.13%, respectively, showing a tendency of increasing threshold from age 7 to 12.

Authentic Worship or Authentic Infection: A Dual-Route Model of Authentic Leadership,"Chung-Jen Chien, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Yu-Hui Lien","self-concept, authentic leadership, career identification, leader identification","Previous studies about authentic leadership focus their attention on the mechanism of leader identification which is the leader centric focus route. However, according the development approach of authentic leadership, there should have another influence route which is subordinate centric approach. This study collected 279 dyadic data and proposed the dual route of authentic leadership. First, we proposed the identification with leader is the mediator of leader centric route and identification with career is the mediator of subordinate centric route. Second, both of these two routes can enhance subordinate's in-role performance. The leader identification route enhanced leader directed OCB while the career identification route enhanced the proactive career behavior. Third, the time supervisor and subordinate work together moderate the career identification route. This route has positive influence effect when the time is longer, but no effect when the time is shorter.

The Nature of Multidimensional Constructs Represented by Item Parcels in Structural Equation Modeling,"You-Lin Chen, Li-Jen Weng","item parcels, multidimensional constructs, structural equation modeling","Item parcels, represented as summation or average over items, can be used as indicators of latent variables in structural equation modeling (SEM). Little et al. (2013) and Cole et al. (2016) indicated that the nature of the multidimensional constructs represented by parcels can be different from that assumed by the researchers. Researchers should thus examine the nature of multidimensional constructs represented by parcels prior to the analysis. Cole et al. and Williams and O’Boyle (2008) pointed out that many constructs investigated in psychological research are multidimensional, consisting of several facets, and item parcels are frequently used as indicators for these constructs in SEM. The present study therefore extended the algebraic derivation of the covariance matrix of item parcels in Sterba & MacCallum (2010) from unidimensional to multidimensional constructs to provide a theoretical framework for examining the nature of multidimensional constructs implied by parcels. The effects of parceling strategy, correlations among facets, and factorial complexity of items on the nature of multidimensional constructs represented by parcels were discussed using this framework and illustrated with a numerical simulation example. Researchers are encouraged to apply the framework proposed in this study to clarify the nature of the multidimensional constructs inferred from item parcels by examining the covariance matrix among parcels to avoid misleading results from SEM analysis.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201903-201904010005-201904010005-25-50,61.1,2019,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"The Taiwanese Version of the Self-Compassion Scale: Psychometric Properties, Implications for Psychological Health and Self-Compassion across Multiple Generations","Yu-Jie Chen, Sue-Huei Chen","psychological distress, psychological well-being, self-compassion","The concept of self-compassion, an empathetic and nurturing attitude toward one's own sufferings and failures, has begun to gain research and clinical attention due to its strong link to psychological health. Nevertheless, in Taiwanese samples, systematic examination of the factorial and construct validity of the Taiwanese version of the Self- Compassion Scale is still warranted. In this study, 854 adults (age range: 20-64 years) were recruited to investigate the levels of self-compassion and the differential associations between self-compassion and psychological health. The results revealed that: 1) via EFA and CFA procedures, the Taiwanese version of the Self-Compassion Scale yields two composites: the incremental composite which was constituted by self-kindness, mindfulness, and common humanity, and the decremental composite which was constituted by self-judgment, isolation, and over-identification of negative experiences; and 2) with hierarchical regression analyses, after controlling for age and gender, the decremental composite was predictive of anxiety and stress, while the two composites were jointly predictive of depression and psychological well-being. Distinct levels of self-compassion were found across multigenerational samples. The younger groups displayed less self-compassion, especially with a manifestation of greater levels in the decremental composite of the Self-Compassion Scale.

Applying the Mantel-Haenszel Method to Exploratory Differential Item Functioning Assessment in Continuous Response Items,"Jyun-Hong Chen, Hsiu-Yi Chao, Ching-Lin Shih","scale purification, differential item functioning, Mantel-Haenszel method, continuous response items","Differential item functioning (DIF) assessment is critical for ensuring test validity and fairness. Many DIF assessment methods have been proposed in the past several decades, including the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method. Such methods are applied to DIF assessment for discrete response items; however, no research has been done for continuous response items. Considering the popularity of the MH method in practical applications, its continuous counterpart (called the MHC method) proposed by Rayner and Best (2012) is applied to assess DIF for continuous response items in this study. The scale purification (SP) is further incorporated to improve the performance of the MHC method in DIF assessment. According to the simulation results, the MHC method with the SP procedure can yield high power rates while controlling type I error rates well in DIF assessment. Since the MHC method can be easily implemented with the SP procedure, it is recommended for test practitioners to conduct DIF assessments to improve the test quality for continuous response items.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201812-201812110003-201812110003-217-231,60.4,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Omitted Variable Bias in Differential Item Functioning Assessment,"Hsiu-Yi Chao, Chi-Chen Chen, Chung-Ping Cheng, Jyun-Hong Chen","omitted variable bias, scale purification, differential item functioning, test fairness","Differential item functioning (DIF) assessment has been widely applied for decades to ensure test fairness in routine item analysis. However, few studies have investigated, or even noticed, omitted variable bias (OVB) while assessing DIF. As a result, the estimation of DIF effects may not be unbiased, resulting in inflated type I error rates and/or deflated power rates of DIF assessment. In testing practices, test practitioners may, therefore, wrongly identify inequality among grouping variables and revise the flagged DIF items based on misleading information. To overcome these problems, two issues were addressed in detail in this study. The first issue is the robustness of the original method (i.e., assessing DIF without considering confounding variables) to OVB, which was examined by evaluating the impact of ignoring OVB in DIF assessment. The second issue occurs when the controlled method (i.e., including all grouping variables) encounters the so-called trade-off between bias and inefficiency while assessing DIF. To address this issue, the backward scale purification (BSP) procedure was applied to the controlled method to improve the performance of DIF assessment. Accordingly, three interrelated studies were conducted. In Study 1, type I error rates for the original and controlled methods in DIF assessment were investigated. The results indicated that the controlled method can well control type I error rates under all conditions. In contrast, the original method lost control of type I error rates when confounding variables exhibited DIF and the correlation among grouping variables was high (i.e., greater than or equal to .2). In Study 2, type II error rates of the controlled method were investigated. In comparison to the true model, the results indicated that the type II error rates of the controlled method increased as the number of confounding variables decreased and the correlation among grouping variables increased. This result manifests the trade-off between bias and inefficiency when adding additional variables to the model. In Study 3, the BSP was applied to the controlled method to reduce the type II error rates. The results indicated that BSP can effectively control type I error rates while maintaining acceptable power rates. In summary, the controlled method with BSP appears promising for helping test practitioners deal with OVB in DIF assessment, thereby ensuring fairness and validity in testing practices.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201812-201812110003-201812110003-233-250,60.4,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Exploring the Variables That Influence the Performance of the DIF-free-then-DIF Strategy in Assessing Differential Item Functioning,"Chi-Chen Chen, Yeh-Tai Chou, Ching-Lin Shih","item response theory, MIMIC, scale purification, DIF-free-then-DIF strategy, confirmatory factor analysis","Conventional differential item functioning (DIF) assessment methods tend to yield an inflated type I error rate and a deflated power rate when the tests contain many DIF items that favor the same group. To control type I error rates in DIF assessments under similar conditions, the DIF-free-then-DIF (DFTD) strategy is proposed. The DFTD strategy consists of two steps: (1) selecting a set of items that is most likely to be DIF-free, and (2) assessing DIF for other items using the designated items as anchors. To explore the variables that influence the performance of the DFTD strategy in assessing DIF, a series of simulation studies was implemented in this study. Three multiple indicators, multiple causes (MIMIC) methods, namely the standard MIMIC method (M-ST), the M IMIC method with scale purification (M-SP), and the iterative MIMIC method (M-IT), were used to select four items as an anchor set before implementing the DFTD strategy. The results of the analysis of variance showed significant differences among M-IT, M-SP, and M-ST in identifying DIFfree items, with M-IT performing better than M-SP, and M-SP performing better than M-ST. The analysis also found that the main effects of DIF patterns, DIF percentages, sample sizes, and item response theory (IRT) models, as well as their interactions, were significant in terms of their accuracy in identifying the DIF-free items. Based on the results, the M-SP and M-IT methods are recommended for use in identifying DIF-free items, especially when there are many DIF items in a test. The same set of variables significantly determined the power rates of these methods in assessing DIF. However, the type I error rates in the DIF assessments were significantly influenced by the DIF patterns, DIF percentages, and sample sizes. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that R500/F500, as well as data fits two-parameter logistic model (2PLM), be adopted when applying the DFTD strategy with t he MIMIC method in assessing DIF.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201812-201812110003-201812110003-251-265,60.4,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Do Taiwanese Adolescents Believe in the Moral Significance of Effort and School Performance?,"Tai-Chuan Chang, Keng-Ling Lay","social-cognitive domain theory, morality, effort, academic achievement, Confucianism","Prior empirical studies have argued that in culturally Confucian societies, academic effort and school performance are deemed role-based morality. Yet these studies have often arrived at their conclusions through inferences drawn from participants' opinions of achievement related acts but not their direct judgement on whether lack of effort or academic performance is immoral. Based on Confucian ethics, Hwang (2012) hypothesized that studying hard and striving for academic achievement are role-based responsibilities and obligatory moral conduct for young learners. Fwu, Wei, Chen, and Wang (2014) further postulated that the role obligation of effort is not only a ＂positive＂ moral duty that requires individuals to act, but also an ＂unconditional positive＂ moral duty that calls for total dedication without temporary exceptions. Alternatively, under the social-cognitive domain theory, role obligation may simply be regarded as a social convention rather than a moral code. Therefore, this study directly investigated whether Taiwanese adolescents viewed effortful learning (EL) and academic performance (AP) as essential moral duties or only duties arising from social convention. Each type of duty was examined twice, first as an obligation that one had better follow and then as an obligation one ought to perpetually observe without exception (i.e., unconditional positive duties). Because filial piety (FP) has typically been construed as an unconditional positive moral obligation in culturally Confucian societies, belief in FP was simultaneously explored for comparison. Overall, 148 college students and 158 tenth graders from Northern Taiwan filled out three forms of questionnaires addressing the target concepts of EL, AP, and FP. Each questionnaire comprised four subscales: social convention, moral code, unconditional positive social convention, and unconditional positive moral code. Analyses of t tests did not support the prior inference that Taiwanese adolescents regarded EL as a moral code. Instead, both high school and college students agreed that EL was a duty arising from social convention. However, from the perspective of Taiwanese adolescents, the social convention aspect of EL was limited, given that it was not accepted as a duty ascribed to unconditional positive social convention. In contrast, the same group of adolescents viewed FP as an unconditional positive moral code that one should observe at all times. AP was construed to be neither a social convention nor a moral duty. In conclusion, no direct evidence supported prior postulations that students in Confucian societies perceive EL and AP as morality-based obligations, not to mention as unconditional positive moral duties. The implications of the findings for Confucian role-based ethics were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201809-201810290001-201810290001-151-172,60.3,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The stimulus, synthesized consonant-vowel monosyllable /da/, was incorporated into a clinical auditory evoked potential (AEP) instrument with clinical parameter settings, such as electrode placement, stimulating, and recording parameters. Twenty bilateral young adults with normal hearing (ten males and ten females) were enrolled in this study. Their average age was 29.00 years (SD = 5.15, range 20–37 years old). With the electrodes placed at Fz-Earlobe-Fpz, speech syllable /da/ was presented to the subjects’ better ear at 80 dB SPL with a rate of 4.3 Hz. Latencies and root mean square (RMS) amplitude of sABR peaks, periodic neural response of fundamental frequency, and composite onset measures (V-A amplitude and V- A slope) were computed and analyzed. Consistency and reproducibility were observed within the corresponding time segment of the neural response waveform. The results also show that there were no gender differences in the above measurements (p ＞ .05). This indicates that a gender effect may not exist at the levels between the auditory brainstem and subcortical regions. Because the measurements of electrophysiological evaluation are susceptible to parameter-setting and individual factors, it is suggested that a norm be established before administering the procedure on subjects. This study provides a basis for applying sABR in subjects with different disorders in various disciplines, such as audiology, speech-language disorders, special education, and the neural sciences.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201809-201810290001-201810290001-173-190,60.3,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Decision on Queue-A Study of Cognitive and Brainwave Responses,"Chih-Chin Liang, Fang-Yu Kuo","brainwave, queuing phenomenon, waiting time","Queuing phenomena are common in service industries. For a service company, the willingness of customers to queue for a service implies the potential revenue. However, how to retain waiting customers or increase customer willingness to queue is an unanswered question. Generally, front desk clerks provide customers with information about the waiting time to help customers decide whether to queue. A clerk can provide the pure situation of waiting or the waiting time to customers. The pure situation of waiting is just related to the fact of queue, but not the waiting time. Brainwaves caused by a stimulus are a vital signal because they can represent customer response to the information of queue. Restated, brainwave changes reflect the different responses between the information of waiting time and information of pure waiting situation. Therefore, this study performed a brainwave experiment to compare between the information of waiting time and pure waiting situation. This study also surveyed customers to find their willingness to queue. The analytical results show that of providing information of waiting time is more useful than provide information of pure waiting situation. From the analysis of brainwave patterns, we can see the differences between the stimuli of pure waiting situation and waiting time statistically.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201809-201810290001-201810290001-191-215,60.3,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology

However, it is still unclear about the cognitive accounts of developmental changes of the semantic radical on lexical processing, including the sublexical and the neighborhood size account. In the present study, we address this issue by recruiting 60 third graders, 54 sixth graders and 28 college students. Participants were tested using the lexical decision task. They had to decide whether a visual symbol was a real Chinese character. Frequency (high, low) and radical combinability (high, low) were independently varied to study lexical processing. There were two main results. First, a significant frequency effect was found across three age groups during the lexical decision task, suggesting that lexical access was involved in the task for participants. Second, for the third graders there was a significant effect on radical combinability effect, with better sensitivity performance on characters with high combinability. This finding suggests that third graders may rely more on the knowledge of the sub-lexical component (i.e., semantic radical) within a character to facilitate their lexical decision judgments. This result can be explained by the bi-directional activation model, using the interactive activation of sublexical and lexical information during lexical processing. In contrast, there was no significant effect on radical combinability in both the sixth graders and college students. We will present several views and future directions to explain the differences in radical processing between children and adults.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201806-201809030005-201809030005-81-100,60.2,2018,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Career Crisis and Adaptation in Middle Adulthood,"Hsiang-Ju Chen, Chingju Grace Chen","career crisis, SOC strategies, psychosocial development theory","As the baby boomers start to step into the retirement and the birth rate has been decreasing, the shortage in the labor force is a significant issue around the world. The postponement of retirement has become one of the strategies to compensate the shortage of the labor force. The midlife employees are facing the challenges to extend their career to cope with this trend. The purpose of the study is to explore the phenomena of careers crisis and the actions taken by the midlife professionals to solve the crisis. Guided by Erikson’s (1959, 1994; Erikson, Erikson, & Kivnick, 1994/2000) psychosocial development theory and P. B. Baltes' (1987, 1997) selection, optimization, and compensation (SOC) strategies, this phenomenological research study interviewed nine adults aged between 35-50 to understand their career development when encountered crisis. The research findings show that the participants' career development stages are similar to Erikson's psychosocial developmental stages, and the career crisis is t he turning point to the next psychosocial developmental stage. For those participants who have successfully completed school age psychosocial development stage, their career crisis themes are related to personal abilities. For those participants who have successfully completed adolescence psychosocial development, their career crisis themes are related to the relations between self and the profession. The research findings conclude three actions for adaptation of the career crisis: looking for another job, learning and seeking help from other professionals, which corresponding to the three strategies: loss-based selection, optimization, and compensation, respectively. Each of the participants applied at least two or more actions to cope with the career crisis, but only the actions that are optimization- or compensation-oriented would help to move into the next psychosocial development stage. The study findings support Erikson's crisis hypothesis in the career psychosocial development and found three adaptive actions to optimize or to compensate the participants' crisis-related issues at the work.

Data were collected from 390 married couples in Greater Taipei area. The measurement included motivations for humor, types of humor, marital quality (satisfaction and regret), and control variables. Factor analysis, latent profile analysis and hierarchical linear models were applied. The main results showed that (1) the motivations for humor were divided into three categories: altruistic, relational, and self-interested; the types of humor were categorized into three types: self-deprecating (oneself as a joke theme), ridiculing (others as a joke theme) and jocosity (words as a joke theme). Husbands had higher scores than wives on relational and self-interested motivation, and used jocosity more often. Husbands also reported higher levels of marital quality than wives. (2) The dyadic humor patterns could be identified as Husband Jocosity and Self-deprecating, Dual Multiplicity, Dual Rarely Use and Wife Ridiculing and Self-deprecating. The four patterns had proportions of about 25%, 25%, 14%, and 35%, respectively. (3) Couples who reported higher relational motivation reported more satisfaction. The Wife Ridiculing and Self-deprecating couples reported lower marital quality than the Husband Jocosity and Self-deprecating and Dual Rarely Use couples. Moreover, the interaction terms of gender and dyadic humor pattern and of humorous motivation and dyadic humor pattern showed significant effects on marital satisfaction.

Grouping in Good Continuity Can Mask a Local Target Regardless of Salience in Visual Search,"Yi-Hui Lu, Li Jingling","collinear masking effect, similarity, visual search, salience, continuity","Salient or well-grouped stimuli usually capture attention. However, our previous studies showed a masking effect by a salient collinear distractor (i.e., snake) on a local target in visual search. Meanwhile, a salient non-collinear distractor (i.e., ladder) indeed facilitates search. The main difference between snake and ladder distractors was the grouping law good continuity. Nevertheless, the grouping law similarity and the saliency of the distractor can also affect search performance. This study aimed to test whether continuity is enough to elicit the collinear masking effect. Experiment 1 made the distractor curved to remove similarity of the items on the distractor, and randomized orientation in the background to reduce saliency of the distractor. Results showed that snake distractors impaired search regardless of similarity and saliency, while ladder distractors facilitated search only when background bars were homogeneous (i.e., when the distractors are salient). Experiment 2 manipulated the orientation of the flankers of the snake distractor to test whether distractor saliency modulated the size of collinear masking. Results showed that the orthogonal flankers make the distractor most salient; however, the size of the masking effect did not correlate to the degree of salience of the distractor. Our results suggest that items grouped in good continuity are sufficient to mask local targets in visual search, and the masking effect is irrelevant to the perceptual salience of the distractor. Our findings implicate possible applications on camouflage.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201712-201804020009-201804020009-183-195,59.4,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Chinese Version of the Owl and Lark Questionnaire: Paper-Pencil and Internet Administration,"Fan-Chi Hsiao, Ling-Ling Tsai","eveningness, social jetlag, morningness, circadian rhythms","Individuals' variation in their preference for the daily timing of sleep and wakefulness is known as chronotype. This study aims to examine the reliability and validity of the Chinese version of the Owl and Lark Questionnaire (OLQ; also known as the Horne and Östberg Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire), which was developed by Horne and Östberg in 1976 and is still today the most frequently used self-evaluation instrument for chronotype. Two self-administration methods for the Chinese OLQ were studied. The paper and pencil version was studied in university students aged between 18 and 28 years and showed an internal consistency Cronbach's alpha value of .7 (N = 213) and a one-month-interval test-retest reliability value of .71 (N = 28). The internet version was administered in general adults aged between 18 and 36 years and showed a Cronbach's alpha value of .75 (N = 660) and a test-retest reliability value of .61 (n = 24) with varying test-retest intervals of 120 ~ 339 days. The OLQ scores of both the versions were negatively correlated with the mean daily bedtime and getup time, i.e., the higher the score (denoting greater circadian preference as a morning type), the earlier the bedtime and getup time. Compared to the morning type and intermediate type, the evening type had the greatest value for the difference in getup time between weekday and weekend and longest sleep duration during the weekend. Age positively and daytime sleepiness negatively correlated to morningness in the internet group. However, sex differences in OLQ scores were not found. Taken together, the results of this study support that both the paper and internet versions of the Chinese OLQ are of good reliability and validity for assessing the phase preference of individuals.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201712-201804020009-201804020009-197-212,59.4,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Historical Psychological Instruments at National Taiwan University,"Lothar Spillmann, Tung-Han Lin, Shojiro Sakurai, Chien-Chung Chen","Germany, sensory psychology, Taiwan, historical instruments","National Taiwan University, formerly Taihoku Teikoku Daigaku (or Taihoku Imperial University), has one of the largest collections of historical instruments in the field of se nsory psychology. A total of one hundred-and-fifty instruments were acquired by Prof. Iinuma, founder and first professor of the Department of Psychology, from Germany between 1930 ~ 1932. Fifty-five instruments have survived. Here we describe 26 of the more important instruments by tracing them to the manufacturer's manuals (e.g., the ＂Zimmermann lists＂), early publications, the World Wide Web, and our own understanding of the mechanical principles that were used in making them. Instruments are grouped according to their use for measurement in the domains of vision, hearing, to uch, time control, performance, and recording. The art of building equipment for experimental research in sensory psychology was well established in Germany during the years 1875 ~ 1914, when companies in Leipzig, Berlin, and Göttingen produced apparatuses not just for German laboratories, but also for laboratories in Czechoslowakia, Serbia, the Netherlands, and even in Japan and the United States. In time, some of these countries started producing their own instruments. For example, the Large Time Sense Apparatus at National Taiwan University (labeled D1 in this manuscript) was not imported from E. Zimmermann Co., but was built by Yamakoshi Seisakusho in Japan in 1945. The impact of these companies onto the history of psychology cannot be overestimated. Psychology was originally part of the Philosophy Department, but became independent thanks to the development of fine-mechanical instruments, which enabled accurate measurement and quantification of empirical results. This so-called ＂new＂ psychology became an experimental science akin to physics and physiology, when apparatuses typically made from steel and brass, became available for the objective investigation of the senses. The goal of studying those old instruments nowadays is threefold: (1) to contribute to the history of scientific instrumentation; (2) to raise awareness in today's students of how early researchers, after conceiving an idea for an experiment, often waited for a long time for an appropriate apparatus to be built; (3) to inspire students to think about the intimate relationship between scientific ideas, available apparatus, and experiments performed. The loss of workshops in today's psychological institutes is deplorable, as computers cannot fully compensate for the flexibility of a fully equipped laboratory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201712-201804020009-201804020009-213-250,59.4,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Top-Down Control on the Perceptual Decision Process in a Double-Dot Detection Task,"Jay Chen, Pei-Yi Lin, Cheng-Ta Yang","perceptual decision process, parallel processing, systems factorial technology, serial processing","Top-down control plays an important role in the selection of an optimal perceptual-decision strategy. However, in previous studies, inferences about the strategies have primarily been based on the participants' subjective reports after they completed all experiments, which can not reflect their trial-by-trial strategies. Hence, this study investigated whether participants can be consciously aware of and control their strategies. A double-dot detection task was conducted and Systems Factorial Technology (SFT) was used for the experimental design, data analysis, and inferences. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to report their strategy (serial or parallel strategy) immediately after each trial; in Experiment 2, participants were asked to pre-select a strategy before a trial started. The results of Experiment 1 showed that all participants utilized either parallel self-terminating processing or coactive processing regardless of their reported strategies. Similarly, the results of Experiment 2 showed that all participants adopted parallel self-terminating processing regardless of their chosen strategies. These findings suggest that participants fail to intentionally adopt serial processing to detect redundant targets. Moreover, these outcomes occurred perhaps because pre-attentive processing is not affected by top-down control; accordingly, our results could further help understandings of how top-down control affects the perceptual decision process.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201709-201710260001-201710260001-125-144,59.3,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Wounded in Temporality: An Existential-Phenomenological Analysis of the Lived Experience of Girls with Childhood Sexual Abuse and Broken Family Relationship,Wei-Lun Lee,"phenomenological psychology, existential temporality, interpersonal reconstruction, childhood sexual abuse","This study discloses existential temporality as the core to understand the lived experience of sexually abused girls with broken family relationship. Through a phenomenological analysis of 8 participants' interview data, the result indicates that, for the girls who had been sexually abused, as their primary parent-child relationship were destroyed, they lost the connections with the adult world and fell out into the ＂wild world.＂ The ＂wild world,＂ in contrast with the ＂mainstream world＂ which is ruled by and composed of social orders, is full of spontaneous actions and events without plan and order. The modes of time lived are the keys to understand the differences between these two worlds. The time lived in the wild world can be called as flowing temporality, in which spontaneous actions are most obvious. While in the mainstream world, social orders and values are founded on the temporality of linear causality. To the girls lived in the wild world, all the desired goals in the mainstream world were set in accordance with the linear temporality and thus with no significance. Living in the wild world, peer relationships on the street appeared to be the pathway for the girls to earn their own linear-causal temporality, which would develop into a ＂new world＂ for the girls to live in. This study indicates the importance of peer relationships for the girls to rebuild the linear-causal temporality in their lives. The significance of existential temporality as a research framework to understand the experiences of girls with childhood sexual abuse is thus demonstrated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201709-201710260001-201710260001-145-161,59.3,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Too Exhausted to Do It? Maybe Your Self-Evaluation is Not Involved: The Activation and Operation of Self-Regulation,"Chien-Ru Sun, Hui-Tzu Lin, Jia-Sin Hong","positive self-evaluation, self-regulation, ego depletion, self-handicapping","Baumeister proposes a strength model of self-regulation and suggests that self-control consumes inner resource, leaving individuals in a state of ego depletion and making them less able to perform subsequent self-control task. Other research suggests that the impairment of performance is only an indication of conservation. When the self-control resource is limited, individuals just become more discriminating as to the task that they are about to perform. That is, motivation might play an important role in self-regulation. Tesser suggests that different self-functions work under the same self-system to maintain rather than maximize one’s positive self-evaluation. In the present study, we tried to combine these two lines of thinking and proposed that all self-control behaviors confluence one another to maintain a positive self-evaluation. Individuals would exert their remaining source, even in the high ego depletion condition, to perform an enhancement-related self-control task if their self-evaluation was threatened. Participants were randomly assigned to a 2 (success feedback: contingent vs. non-contingent) × 2 (ego depletion: low vs. high) × 2 (task type: performance-interfering vs. performance-irrelevant) experimental design. The main dependent measure was the number of trials accurately accomplished on the stroop task. Results gave support to our hypotheses. Individual who received non-contingent success feedback would manage to perform significantly more trials when they were told that the stroop task would interfere with their subsequent formal task than performance-irrelevant, even when they were highly depleted. Furthermore, when receiving contingent successful feedback (i.e., self-handicapping tendency was low), individuals with low ego depletion showed no differences on the performance with those who in the high ego depletion condition. In other word, we found individuals would manage to exert the remaining inner resource to accomplish more trials on the self-control task which could provide ＂excuses＂ for their possible future failure, even when they were ＂exhausted.＂ However, their basic motive was to maintain rather than maximize their positive self-evaluation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201709-201710260001-201710260001-163-181,59.3,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology

This study proposed concepts of rape myths from the Chinese point of view and established measurement tool suitable for Chinese society accordingly. Researchers of this study proposed family orientation, chastity orientation, other-orientation, and reflection orientation as the characteristics of Chinese rape myths based on Chinese traditional values and past research findings. The study collected data through anonymous self-report questionnaires surveying students of five public and seven private universities. The number of valid questionnaires was 969. The results of this study showed that the characteristic of family orientation could be further divided into rape victim extension and rapist extension. The characteristics of chastity orientation and other-orientation could be combined into one construct. The revised attributes of the measurement scale included four subscales: rape victim extension myths, rapist extension myths, chastity and other-oriented myths, and reflection myths. The resulted measurement scale was sufficient in internal consistency and composite reliability, and was validated through construct validity, cross-validation validity, and criteria-related validity.

Social Internet Use and Social Stress: A Perspective of Reduction or Stimulation of Interpersonal Relationships,"Ssu-Kuang Chen, Lawrence Y. Wang, Pei-Chun Liao, Sunny S. J. Lin","stimulation hypothesis, social stress, latent transition analysis, reduction hypothesis, social Internet use","The Internet can stimulate social relationships, but it can also reduce the quality of real-world social relationships if over-used. There has been insufficient evidence about the relationship between Internet use and social stress. The aim of this study was to investigate whether social stressors are associated with social Internet use in terms of the reduction and stimulation hypotheses. Using longitudinal data from 430 students over three years, we first conducted a latent class analysis (LCA) to determine students' latent classifications based on three self-reported social stressors at each time point. These three stressors related to intimate relationships, peer relationships, and parent-adolescent relationships. Latent transition analysis (LTA) was then conducted to examine how the latent classifications changed over time, and transition patterns were identified. In the next stage, the relationship between stress transition patterns and social Internet use was assessed. The findings indicated that students could be classified as having ＂high social stress＂ or ＂low social stress＂ at each time point. The transition patterns included ＂all high,＂ ＂all low,＂ and ＂improving.＂ The results showed that students who frequently used the Internet to make new friends experienced high social stress both initially and over time. Increasing Internet use to find boyfriends/girlfriends may have reduced later social stress. However, frequently using the Internet to maintain existing relationships did not affect social stress transitions. In sum, using the Internet for social purposes does not necessarily reduce social stress. Students should employ effective and direct stress coping methods instead of the Internet to release their social stress.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201706-201708210003-201708210003-89-104,59.2,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
A Comparison of Identity and Emotional Expression Processing between Real and Line-Drawn Faces,"Ya-Yun Chen, Gary C.-W. Shyi","emotion, facial expression, eye movements, line-drawn faces, face recognition","Face processing and recognition has been one of the most productive research areas in cognitive science over the past four decades, and in most studies images of real faces are the focus of inquiry. Owing to the proliferation of technology in social media in recent years, we have witnessed a significant surge of using line-drawn faces and expressions along with their real-face counterparts for purpose of communication. Here in two experiments we examined how line-drawn faces may differ from real faces in terms of identity and emotional expression processing. In Experiment 1, we used the part-whole task and showed that, compared to real faces, line-drawn faces were processed in a more part-based manner similar to non-face objects (i.e., houses). In Experiment 2, we tracked participants' eye movements while they performed a delayed matching-to-sample task, in terms of expressed emotion, where images of either real or line-drawn faces were used as the sample. In addition, we also examined the role a verbal label may play in identifying the facial expression that matched the description. We did this to test the idea whether facial expressions of line-drawn face were in general more symbolically coded than real faces such that a verbal label would be more effective in retrieving those expressed by line-drawn faces. The results indicated that while line-drawn faces differed from real faces in terms of identity processing, they may be quite similar in terms of expression processing. Furthermore, compared to real faces, providing a verbal label failed to offer any additional help locating the matched expression from line-drawn faces, after controlling for the potential speed-accuracy tradeoff with inverse efficiency scores. This might explain why it has become a common practice to exaggerate portrayed expression in line-drawn faces: To overcome the inherently vague signals of emotional expression.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201706-201708210003-201708210003-105-123,59.2,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Would Longer Fixation Duration Lead to Better In-Game Advertising Effect?

First, we manipulated the location of placement (in area-of-interest or in non-area-of-interest) and the type of placement (location-change target or no-location-change non-target) to examine how placement attract our attention in a change detection task. In addition to reaction time, correct detection and recognition rate, we also used an eye tracker to examine the role of visual attention in change detection. Besides, we measure liking and purchase intention as an index of effects. The results showed that placement was in the AOI attracted participants' attention more quickly. Moreover, the results of eye movements showed that longer fixation duration and more fixation number were observed for targets than for non-targets. More importantly, non-targets and placement in non-AOI showed higher liking and purchase intention than targets and those in AOI. The results imply that in this goal-directed target-change- detection task, level of liking, and purchase intention of the placement cannot be reflected in the eye movement indexes. Future studies could add the index of unconscious processing to clarify the implicit effects of in-game advertising.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201703-201705080010-201705080010-1-27,59.1,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology

In this study, we tested young children's imitation and emulation learning using a modified trap-tube task that has been devised to investigate tool use in ethological studies. In the four experimental conditions, 2-year-old children watched as a reward was released or trapped. In two human conditions, they observed the experimenter attempt either successfully or unsuccessfully with a tool stick. In two ghost conditions, they saw the tool move as if self-propelled and mimic the object movements involved in the experimenter's correct solution or failed attempts. Two control conditions included a baseline and an action control in which the experimenter manipulated particular locations with irrelevant acts. Results indicated that, regardless of success, only following human demonstrations did children imitate the tool-use more than did those in the ghost and two control conditions. Children in these latter conditions did not differ in the tendency to use emulation t o solve the task, and emulated more than did children seeing human demonstrations. Despite the relative tendency to emulate the goal of the task, the study suggests an important role of observing human modeling for children's learning about tool-use through imitation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201703-201705080010-201705080010-29-44,59.1,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Problem of Emotion Regulation and Its Association with Family Context in Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,"Li-Yu Shyu, Chien-Hui Tu, Chin-Bin Yeh","family context, emotion regulation, children with ADHD, parental meta-emotion philosophy, emotion response","Much of the current literature dealing with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) had focused on their two primary deficits; namely, inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Their deficiencies in emotion regulation has also been concerned recently. Nevertheless, the difficulties of emotion regulation in children with ADHD cannot be fully accounted by their cognitive deficiency such as inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity. Based on the ＂Tripartite Model of the Impact of the Family on Children's Emotion Regulation and Adjustment＂, the purpose of this study was to examine the 3 family contexts-parent's emotion expression, parental meta emotion philosophy and emotional climate of the family among children with ADHD. Different impacts of the family contexts on children's emotion response and emotion regulation in children with and without ADHD were also compared. Participants included 60 children with ADHD and 60 no diagnosed controls between 6 and 12 years of age. Children's emotional response was coded through laboratory analogous method, and their parents were asked to fill out ＂Self Expressiveness in the Family Questionnaire, ＂Scale of Parental Meta-Emotion Philosophy,＂ ＂Conflict Tactic Scale,＂ and ＂The Emotion Questionnaire.＂ The results indicated that children with ADHD tended to underestimate their emotion response and overestimate their emotion regulation ability than their parents. As the reports of parents, children with ADHD displayed more emotion regulation difficulties than controls. Significant differences between groups were found in the family contexts. Among the 3 family contexts, parental meta- emotion philosophy was the significant predictor to the emotion response and emotion regulation of children with ADHD. Children's emotion response was predicted by parent's emotion dismissing philosophy and emotion dysfunction philosophy. Children's emotion regulation was predicted by parent's emotion coaching. Implications for the understanding and intervention of emotion regulation problems among children with ADHD were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201703-201705080010-201705080010-45-62,59.1,2017,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Bivariate correlations and sets of multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the direct effects of multi dimensional victimization on child internet addiction and the indirect effects through psychological symptoms. The results reveal that being male and experiencing victimization (psychological neglect, physical neglect, witnessing domestic violence, and bully victimization) are associated with an increased risk of developing psychological symptoms and internet addiction among children. Moreover, we found that psychological symptoms partially mediate the associations between multidimensional victimization and child internet addiction, with the exception of physical neglect.

Age Differences in Face Memory and Face Processing between Younger and Older Adults in Taiwan,"Ya-Hsin Cheng, Gary Chon-Wen Shyi, Kuan-Hao Cheng","age differences, face memory, face processing, face recognition","The main goal of the present study was threefold: (1) to establish a test that utilizes face images collected and normed in the Taiwanese society in order to provide a culturally calibrated tool for assessing face memory ability, (2) to examine the relationship between face memory performance and a range of face processing tasks to reveal underlying mechanisms that may play an important role in face memory, and (3) to investigate the relationship between age differences in face memory performance and those in holistic processing as revealed by the face processing tasks. To create the Taiwanese face memory test (TFMT), we followed the procedure of Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT), and used images from a Taiwanese face database. Like CFMT, TFMT was administered in three stages with increasing difficulty. The results of TFMT revealed a pattern almost identical to that found with CFMT (Study 1). In addition, younger adults outperformed older adults in TFMT as well as in all three face processing tasks (Studies 2 & 3). Furthermore, while younger adults exhibited reliable inversion effects in both component and configural tasks, older adults failed to do so except for the oldest subgroup showing inversion effect in the configural task. In contrast, older adults exhibited a pattern of interaction between alignment and congruency similar to that found with younger adults for the composite task, demonstrating both age groups can process faces holistically. Regression analyses on the relationship between face memory and face processing performances for both age groups revealed that, while each face processing task has its own share of holistic processing, they may be tapping into different aspects of holistic processing. Moreover, holistic processing captured by the component task and its inversion effect, entailing subtle spatial relationship between local facial features and landmarks, may underlie face memory performance for both younger and older adults in Taiwan. Taken together, besides showcasing distinct styles or strategies between younger and older adults in coping with the specific demands of each face processing task, our findings suggest that our participants, both young and old, appeared to rely upon the same aspects of holistic and non-holistic processing revealed by the component task, for encoding and later retrieving memory for faces.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201612-201702130016-201702130016-233-262,58.4,2016,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Mortality Salience on Attention: An Example of Cultural Cues,"Hua-fu He, Nai-Shing Yen","terror management theory, visual search task, distal defense, eye-tracker, culture-worldview","According to terror management theory, people can manage a threat after thinking about death. This theory proposes a dual-process model to explain how people defend death thoughts. There are two defense routes: proximal and distal. The cultural worldview serves an important function in distal defense. Studies conducted in Western countries found that people were more positive or preferred the self-culture-worldview; however, mixed findings have been reported in the studies conducted in Eastern countries. To investigate the distal defense mechanism, this study manipulated participants' thought of death and let that thought descend into their unconscious through a distracting task. This study also examined the relationship between the cultural worldview and death defense from attentional paradigms by conducting two experiments. In the first experiment, we adopted the visual search paradigm, and the dependent variables were reaction time and the rate of accuracy. We found it was more accurate when participants were asked to search the cue within their own culture after reminding themselves of death thoughts compared to those that did not remind them about death. However, no significant differences in the reaction time were found. In the second experiment, we used an eye tracker, and the dependent variables were the index of number of first fixation and the duration of fixations. We found that the fixation duration was longer for the cues within one's own culture than those for non-self-related culture when the participants were reminded about their death. However, there were no significant differences in the number of first fixations.

However, the dimensional structure of trust and its potential functions in the parent-child conflict situations have less been investigated. The purpose of this research was two-fold. First, it aimed to verify the proposed two-dimensional concept of trust, cognition- and affect-based trust. Considering the research focus on the children's side in intergenerational interaction context, cognition-based trust is rooted in the perception of parents' competences, and affect-based trust the accumulated fondness for parents. Second, it attempted to compare the functions of these two dimensions of trust in different parent-child conflict situations, including different types of conflict issue and different conflict dyads. To achieve the purposes above, two independent studies were conducted. Study 1 verified the two-dimension (cognition- and affection based) ＂parent-child trust scale＂ developed by this research which was measured with 3 different situational cues (i.e., conflict issues) in the father-and mother-child conflict respectively, using data from 207 undergraduate students. Study 2 explored the functions of children's cognition- and affect-based trust toward parents on their reflective thinking and empathy to parents in the conflict context, using data from another sample of 218 undergraduate students. The results in Study 1 found that the ＂parent-child trust scale＂ had a stable two-factor solution and a great internal consistency reliability of each subscale, no matter the children's trust was measured towards father or mother and measured towards the conflict issues about children's academic performance, interpersonal relationship or life habits. The SEM results in Study 2 showed that Children's cognition- and affect-based trust towards their parents had positive associations with reflective thinking and empathy to parents in the conflict context. However, the strength of associations varied with both the type of issues and the targets with whom the children interact in the conflict context. Additionally, the results from both studies steadily showed that the effects of affection-based trust on parent-child interaction manifested much higher cross-situational consistency than the effects of cognition-based trust.

With reference to previous studies, the IJA was divided into full-IJA (F-IJA) and partial-IJA (P-IJA). A structured tool and the parent-report scale were both used to measure language abilities, including the Mullen Scale of Early Learning (MSEL) and the Communication Subscale in Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-II (ABAS-II). Results: The results of this study showed that, F-IJA, P-IJA, RJA, object imitation, and manual imitation were significantly related to receptive language, expressive language, and overall language from MSEL, and communicative ability from ABAS-II. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to control chronological age and non-verbal cognitive ability. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that, the strongest predictor of receptive language, expressive language, and overall language from MSEL, as well as communicative ability from ABAS-II, was RJA. In addition, manual imitation was the second predictor of language abilities, as it could predict the development of expressive language and overall language according to MSEL. However, neither object imitation nor IJA could predict the development of language abilities. Conclusions: The results of this study revealed that RJA was the robust predictor of language abilities in young children with ASDs. Young children with ASDs could correctly follow their partner when directing their attention, and understand the intention, which is a critical factor of early language development. Generally speaking, when young children with ASDs experience interesting social interactions and engagements, it could enhance their expressive language development. The results provide the implications to design the goals and skills for the early intervention in young children with ASDs.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201609-201611240001-201611240001-187-206,58.3,2016,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Therefore, we engaged 28 participants (14 of whom were female) to view pictures belonging to the following five emotion categories of the Taiwan Affective Picture System (TAPS): positive, erotic, general neutral, bloody, and negative. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data was recorded while participants passively viewed emotional pictures. Participants were asked to judge the valence and arousal levels they experienced for each viewed stimulus. Behaviorally, we did not observe any differences in the ratings of both valence and arousal levels across emotional categories between male and female participants. Event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by erotic, general neutral, and negative pictures were also comparable between the two groups. Gender differences were observed for positive and bloody pictures. In comparison to male, female participants showed a larger positive going ERP component for positive and bloody pictures between 400 and 1,000 ms after stimuli onset. This late positive potential (LPP) has been established with emotion-processing associations. We interpreted these characteristic responses to emotion in women as an adaptation in their role as caregivers due to evolution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201609-201611240001-201611240001-207-216,58.3,2016,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The first was to clarify clinical symptom factors in chronic inpatient schizophrenics. The second was to explore whether there were different symptom profiles based on patients' clinical symptom factor structure. Method: One hundred and ninety-six subjects, who met the diagnostic criteria of schizophrenia in DSM-IV, were included in this study. There were 115 male and 81 female participants and their mean age and education level (here referred to in terms of years of education experience) were 51.57 years and 10.04 years respectively. All subjects had a routine antipsychotics therapy session and participated in a Chinese version of a PANSS interview facilitated by one of six psychiatrists. The results from the PANSS interviews were analyzed using GAP and EFA. Results: The results from the GAP analysis showed that there were five symptom factors; these factors were impaired cognition, positive symptoms, emotional retardation, depression/anxiety, and social withdrawal. According to these factors, chronic inpatient schizophrenics could be categorized into 3 profiles groups: 1. a significant mixed positive and negative symptom group, 2. a significant widespread symptom group, and 3. a significant social withdrawal group. This study also found that there were two mutually independent components of negative symptom factors in the original PANSS. Conclusion: This study identified five factor-based structure profiles for clinical symptoms in chronic inpatient schizophrenics. In addition, based on findings there are no any correlation among patient’ age, educational level, impaired cognition and emotional retardation, these two factors may be potential markers for early detection of schizophrenia.

Eye Movement Evidence for the Effects of Word Boundary Cue When Reading Chinese,"Chia-Hsing Chen, Jie-Li Tsai","Chinese word segmentation, reading processing unit, word boundary","The insertion or omission of inter-word spaces is used to investigate the role of word boundaries on reading performance. It has been argued that inter-word spaces in reading alphabetic languages improves reading performance by reducing the lateral inhibitory effects of the first and last letters of a word; inter-word spaces also provide word length information making words salient as the saccade targets. For language scripts without spaces, it has been shown that the insertion of inter-word spaces does not cause a significant disruption in reading performance. Bai, Yan, Liversedge, Zang, and Rayner (2008) suggested a mutual-offset hypothesis to explain the indifferences between reading spaced and unspaced Chinese sentences. That is, when inserting spaces between words, word processing is enhanced, but the unfamiliar spaced text causes certain interference. The effects cancel each other and result in the lack of differences between two conditions. However, the insertion of whole character spaces in their study might affect the quality of preview processing and increase the amount of oculomotor errors. The present study used frames to provide segmentation cues for the string of characters into four types of perceptual grouping (word, non-word, character, and full line) without changing the spatial layout of characters. The goals of this study are: 1. to investigate whether word or character is the meaning unit during reading Chinese; and 2. to examine the mutual-offset hypothesis. The results showed that words were the main process units during reading Chinese but characters may play a role at the early visual processing. Moreover, the analyses of the lag and successor effects examined the mutual-offset hypothesis and shed some light on the possible sources of interferences and benefits for providing word segmentation cues in reading Chinese.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201603-201605300001-201605300001-19-44,58.1,2016,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Revisiting the Relationship between Visual Functions and Reading Difficulty: A Large Sample Perspective,"Chun-Chia Kung, Yuan-Chin Lin, Ding-Ruey Yeh","dot-coherence test, developmental dyslexia, contrast sensitivity test, magnocellular hypothesis","Among the various etiologies of developmental dyslexia, the hypothesis of the defected specific subcortical structure, known as the magnocellular (M) pathway, is still contentious. Its supporting evidence is limited in that some task comparisons, which normally show group differences between dyslexic and normal readers, fail to consider the prevalence rate of dyslexia. Such negligence may have missed some poor visual task performers who have normal reading, and the normal vs. dyslexic-at-risk poor visual performers may be equal ratio or larger in the former, making magnocellular hypothesis much less persuasive. So far, this assertion remains untested. In the current study, large sample were collected from the second and third Taiwan elementary school graders, on reading comprehension (as well as their academic performance on mathematics and language for corroboration) and the two often cited M-related tasks: dot coherence (DC, N = 381) and contrast sensitivity (CS, N = 165). The results disagreed with the previously suggested 1 ~ 2:1 poor-DC/CS with normal or with poor reading ratio, suggesting that the real ratios could be larger (4 ~ 8:1). In addition, significant DC-reading and CS-reading, but insignificant DC-CS, correlations were found, indicative of shared yet distinct reading-related mechanisms that are less likely from a single origin. Among other possible but unfavorable explanations (such as test position variability, light conditions during testing, and the students’ visual acuities), these results concur the relations between visual functions and reading, but unsupportive of the magnocellular hypothesis of dyslexia. Lastly, the current study exemplifies an efficient group testing/screening protocol applicable to developmental dyslexia and other research domains.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201603-201605300001-201605300001-45-62,58.1,2016,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Impact and Sources of Family Efficacy Beliefs in Chinese Society,"Rong-Kou Liu, Reuy-Ling Chu","Panel Study of Family Dynamics (PSFD), family efficacy belief, family values, social cognitive theory","Rooted in social cognitive theory, the present paper considered efficacy beliefs that each family member holds about its role as a spouse, parent, and child. Further, it was examined how these different efficacy beliefs relate to the quality of family functioning, individual well-being and family values over time. The first study analyzed survey data derived from the Panel Study of Family Dynamics (PSFD) of Taiwanese in 2007 and 2009 by means of structural equation modeling. The results showed that parental efficacy, marital efficacy, and filial efficacy were linked to the qualities of their corresponding relationship respectively, reflecting the ＂domain- specific＂ theoretical construct of efficacy. People's perceived self-efficacy to manage family relationships affected their satisfaction with family life both directly and through its impact on family practices, and these relations held both concurrently and longitudinally. In particular, marital efficacy contributed the most to the quality of family life in contemporary Taiwan society. The second study tested a structural model in which relevant sources influenced family efficacy beliefs. Findings based on a new sample drawn in 2003 and 2007 from PSFD showed that besides the past experiences of family interaction and relation, personal values related to the family functions, such as the marriage in stitution and affective connection, helped establish efficacy. In conclusion, for understanding the reciprocal relations among efficacy beliefs, family processes, and psychological adjustments, it is important to take the dynamics of the whole family system and cultural values into consideration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201603-201605300001-201605300001-63-87,58.1,2016,Chinese Journal of Psychology

We propose a structural model of NSSI and suicidal risk, in which negative affect (NA) predicts both anxiety and depression, low positive affect (PA) predicts depression only, anxiety is linked to NSSI, and depression is linked to suicidal risk. Method: Four hundreds and eighty seven undergraduates participated. Data were collected by administering self-report questionnaires including the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Deliberate Self-Harm Inventory, the Scale of Suicidal Risk, and the Symptom Checklist-90-R. We performed hierarchical regression and structural equation modeling to test the proposed structural model. Results: The results largely support the proposed structural model, with one exception: anxiety was strongly associated with NSSI and to a lesser extent with suicidal risk. The conclusions of this study are as follows: The co-occurrence of NSSI and suicidal risk is due to NA and anxiety, and suicidal risk can be differentiated by the presence depression and low PA. That is, in this model, there are two pathways. First, NA predicts anxiety and depression, and predicts NSSI and suicidal risk through the mediation of anxiety. NA also predicts suicidal risk through the mediation of depression. Second, low PA predicts depression and also predicts suicidal risk through the mediation of depression.

In the present study we proposed that the self-evaluation should be influenced by both social comparison and temporal comparison. To be exact, we suggested that different temporal performance trends would affect one’s self-efficacy, and then moderated the impact of social comparison on self-evaluation. Two experiments were conducted to examine our hypotheses. In Experiment 1, ninety-two participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (temporal comparison: improvement/same/deterioration) × 2 (social comparison: upward/ downward) between-subjects design. A series of false performance feedbacks of an ability tests were used to manipulate different trends of temporal comparison information and others’ average performance was also provided at the end as social comparison information. The results showed that, the trend of temporal performance feedback did affect one’s sense of self-efficacy, controllability, and future expectation. As predicted, a significant interaction effect of social comparison and temporal comparison on self-evaluation was found. The Experiment 2 tried to replicate the moderate effect of temporal comparison and further investigated the importance of the temporal performance trend. Seventy-five participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (temporal comparison: improvement with low average/same with moderate average/deterioration with high average) × 2 (social comparison: upward/downward) between-subjects design. The results also showed a similar interaction effect as Experiment 1.

The current study examined whether this “prestimulus subsequent memory effect” dissociates between recollection- and familiarity-related encoding. Participants first engaged in a study phase, during which they made one of two types of judgments to concrete nouns. The judgment to be made for each word was signaled by a cue presented prior to the nouns. In the following test phase, participants differentiated studied words from unstudied ones. They were also asked to identify the type of judgment made to the identified words at study. ERPs elicited by the task cues during the study phase were sorted according to whether the following study items were recognized and their sources (i.e., judgment type during encoding) correctly identified in the subsequent recognition test. The cue-eliciting ERPs were found to be more negative-going over the left frontal area when the study items were correctly identified (hit trials) in comparison to those that were incorrectly rejected (miss trials). Importantly, when the hit trials were further segregated according to their source judgment accuracy, source-correct hit trials gave rise to a frontally distributed negativity in comparison to source-incorrect ones. Source-incorrect hit trials, on the other hand, were associated with a widespread positivity when compared with miss trials. On the basis that source correct hits involve both recollection- and familiarity-based recognition whereas source incorrect hits involve familiarity only, we argue that the current findings reflect dissociable prestimulus subsequent memory effects for subsequent recollection- and familiarity-related encoding activities.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201512-201601050011-201601050011-339-352,57.4,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Contextual Information on Reading Span,"Cheng-Han Chiang, Hsiang-Chun Chen, Yuh-Shiow Lee","memory reconstruction, sequential recognition, working memory span, free recall","Working memory plays an important role in school learning. This study using the reading span task investigated how contextual information provided by the processing component enhances the working memory storage. In Experiment 1, we found that the contextual information and the integration between the processing task and target words facilitated memory performance, while increasing cognitive load had an interference effect. Experiment 2 showed that in free recall, participants actively used the contextual information to reconstruct the target words of the storage task. Experiment 3 further used the sequence recognition test and found that the contextual information enhanced participants’ recognition of both absolute and relative positions of the target words. Experiment 2 and 3 also found that participants’ memory performance was only benefitted from conditions with a high level of contextual information. These findings demonstrated that participants actively made use of the contextual information provided by the processing task and that changing cognitive load in the processing task had an effect. More importantly, the sequential information from the contextual relationship between the sentences in the processing component was the basis for reconstructing the target words in a reading span task. These findings are discussed in terms of the mechanism underling the facilitation effect of the processing component in a working memory task.

Adolescent Positive/Negative Thinking and Mental Health: The Moderating Roles of Proactive Coping and Procrastination Habit,"Kun-Hu Chen, Yun-An Chou","life satisfaction, procrastination habit, depression, proactive coping, positive/negative thinking","Traditionally, the field of psychology adopts a negative or medical viewpoint to understand adolescents’ mental health or psychopathology. With the rise of positive psychology, researchers have started to pay more attention to the positive viewpoint. This study focused on the relation between thinking styles and mental health in adolescence; meanwhile, the study also attempted to examine whether coping styles could be moderators between thinking styles and mental health. In addition to examining the above-mentioned issues, the study tried to elucidate the functions of positive/ negative thinking styles and coping styles (i.e., proactive coping and procrastination habit) for the indices of positive/ negative mental health (i.e., life satisfaction and depression) respectively. A total of 303 junior high school students in the Taipei metropolitan area filled out questionnaires of positive/negative thinking, proactive coping, procrastination habit, life satisfaction and depression. The results showed that positive thinking could more successfully predict individual’s life satisfaction whereas negative thinking was a better predicator of individual’s depression. Moreover, proactive coping not only moderated the relation of negative thinking and life satisfaction, but also moderated the relation of negative thinking and depression. In summary, the study implied that positive/negative thinking seem to play different roles in adolescent mental health. Meanwhile, proactive coping can serve as a buffer against the harmful impact of negative thinking on mental health.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201512-201601050011-201601050011-373-388,57.4,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Influences of Prior Intention and Causal Understanding on Preschoolers' Observational Learning from Others' Mistakes,"Wan-Ling Chung, Chi-Tai Huang","tool use, mistake, observational learning, imitation, prior intention","Previous research has shown that 3-year-old children benefit from observing a model's failure to retrieve a reward in a trap-tube task before they are shown a correct solution (Want & Harris, 2001). In this study, we investigated whether the tendency to benefit from mistakes is influenced by the availability of causal information or the model's intention. In two demonstration conditions, 30- and 41-month-old children (N = 116) observed an experimenter trap the reward before demonstrating how to obtain it with a tool from either a clear or an opaque tube. The clear tube made the causal properties of the task visible, whereas the opaque tube prevented them from being seen. In two other conditions, children were allowed to explore the task spontaneously or watched the experimenter manipulate the tool using actions irrelevant to retrieving the reward. Results indicated that both 30- and 41-month-old children imitated the demonstrated tool use regardless of the transparency of the task, but they did not show a bias in favor of the correct solution. However, when considering overall performance (reward retrieval achieved via both imitative and emulative strategies), 41-montholds were successful in retrieving, as opposed to trapping, the reward in the opaque condition. The facilitating effect of observing others' mistakes is unlikely to be due solely to prior intention or causal understanding. We suggest that children flexibly vary the strategy they used to reproduce a model's actions and action outcomes depending on what they perceive as relevant in the situation of the task.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201509-201510120022-201510120022-213-227,57.3,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Affordances for Stair Climbing Is Induced by Standing Conditions and Perceptual Systems,"Chia-Sheng Huang, Chih-Mei Yang, Chih-Hui Chang, Hank Jwo","visual perception, maximum riser height, haptic perception, direct perception","Affordances in ecological psychology refer to a specific relation between the individuals and their environment. The definition for the properties of environment should refer to the characteristics of animals and be interpreted through the concept of body scale. This study, based on the ecological approach, was designed to investigate haptically and visually guided stair climbability. Affordances were examined for perceived maximum riser heights by changing individual's standing heights. Twenty-four adults were recruited, and randomly assigned to either haptic judgement group or visual judgement group. Participants were asked to judge whether each stair height is climbable if raised single leg only. The judgments were made through two perceptual modalities, viewing and exploring with a white cane. Three experimental conditions were arranged when participants made their judgments either standing on the real floor, standing on 10-cm height raised floor, or wearing 10-cm height blocks. An adjustable stair was used to measure perceived maximum raiser heights of participants, and the critical ratio was calculated by comparing the height to the leg length of participants. The results showed that perception of affordances for maximum riser heights would not be influenced by standing heights. The relation between the lengths of the individual's legs and the stair heights would maintain invariant. Despite individuals perceived maximum raiser heights with different perceptual systems, the accuracy and confidence of haptic and visual judgment did not differ. Our finding was identical with the viewpoint of perceptual equivalence. The perceived maximum raisers height by the haptic exploration might not be specified merely by the concept of body scale with leg length. Future research could examine the factors such as the properties of body components and objects to clarify the affordances of climbing stair.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201509-201510120022-201510120022-229-243,57.3,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Improving Your Chance to Discover an Interaction Effect by Changing the Inquiry Goal,"Pei-Hsuan Lee, Yunn-Wen Lien","scientific reasoning, inquiry learning, interaction effect, self-directed experiment task, causal reasoning","Previous research on scientific reasoning has shown that adults and children are poor at discovering interaction effects in inquiry tasks that involve multi-cause structures. Lack of a relevant causal framework and relevant reasoning skills have often been proposed to explain the failure rate. In this study we aimed to demonstrate that participants' performance finding interaction effects could be greatly improved by changing the inquiry goal even when the relevant abilities and task were kept the same. Three experiments with a self-directed experiment (SDE) paradigm were conducted to test the hypothesis at different levels of inquiry task complexity. With the SDE paradigm, participants could change the values of candidate variables in each test trial and observe the effect (i.e., the speed of toy racing cars) in order to figure out the underlying causal structure. Undergraduate participants were randomly assigned to two groups that only differed by the inquiry goal. In the causal-status group, particip ants were instructed to determine which variables could influence the effect of concern and how, as previous studies usually did; in the causal-rule group, participants were instead told to find a causal rule to predict the effect. In addition, participants’ abilities at inferring an interaction effect from a set of double-controlled experiments (changing the value of a variable at each level of the other variable while keeping other variables constant) and designing experiments to test a target interaction hypothesis were also measured. As predicted, the success rate at finding a target interaction between two candidate causes for casual-rule group was twice as much as for casual-status group in all three experiments. The causal-status group performed poorly as previous studies reported, even though their abilities of inferring and testing interactive hypothesis were as good as the other group's. Moreover, the causal-rule group tested more interactive hypotheses, less single-variable hypotheses, and thus had more chances to gather evidence about interaction with the same amount of testing trials. These results, for the first time show that adults' performance on finding interactive effects can be influenced by a top-down contextual factor, i.e., the inquiry goal, via changing the availability of interactive hypotheses in the reasoner's mind. Implications for science education are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201509-201510120022-201510120022-245-260,57.3,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Two types of attitude objects were chosen to test the reliability, validity and the predictability of behaviors of the AMP. Using the AMP, Study 1 found that those whom had already given up smoking responded to smoking cues with a clearly negative affect, whereas the smokers' responses depended on individual differences. The differentiation ability of the AMP duplicated the results of previous studies. Moreover, the AMP on smoking cues also tended to predict smokers' behavioral tendencies to smoke in the future. Study 2 explored junior high school students' attitudes toward a sensitive issue: the effeminate males. The pattern of results in Study 2 mostly matched the predictions using the dual pathway mode. That is, only self-reported attitude could predict the controlled behavior, and the automatic attitude measured by the AMP showed a larger relationship with the spontaneous behavior than the other measures. Across the two studies, the AMP displayed its advantages in ease of use, both for young students and the elderly; high reliability; and good behavioral predictions, especially for spontaneous behavior.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201509-201510120022-201510120022-261-280,57.3,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The proposed model indicates that deviant sexual arousal, distorted cognitions (child sexual abuse myths), and an antisocial personality directly affect the formation of child sexual abuse proclivity; sociocultural perception directly affects the formation of deviant sexual arousal and distorted cognitions; childhood sexual abuse experiences directly influence the formation of deviant sexual arousal; and childhood sexual abuse experience, primary caretaker's physical abuse, rejection, and neglect directly affect the formation of an antisocial personality. We used an anonymous self-report questionnaire to collect data. The research sample comprised 915 male inmates and 559 male college students. Structural equation modeling was employed to verify the proposed model. The results show that the measurement model attained acceptable reliability and validity. Furthermore, the structural model was supported by observable data and most fit indices in both samples, accounting for 77% of the variance in child sexual abuse proclivity in the male inmates and 73% of the variance in the college students.

Firstly, this study reviewed theories and studies related to leader-subordinate relationship in organization. Secondly, based on the review of past studies taking perspective of self-concept that used degree of relational bonds to define selfrelational identity, this study adopted viewpoint of social cognitive schema to define ＂relational dyadic role＂ to fill up the gap; meanwhile, considering the characteristics of vertical relationship in modern organizations after culture shock from Western to Chinese traditional culture, this study further clarified the dimensions and contents of cognitive structure of vertical leader-subordinate relationship. That is, by using the two dimensions of ＂equal/unequal＂ and ＂close/distant,＂ the contents of the leader-subordinate relational identity (LSRI) could be classified into four categories: communal affection relationship (equal and close), instrumental exchange relationship (equal but distant), care-repay relationship (unequal but close), and authority-obedience relationship (unequal and distant).

Initial Direction of Movement and Drop-Ball Procedure Influence the Gravity Bias in Preschoolers,"Chi-Tai Huang, Yi-An Lin","gravity bias, attention, naïve theory, causal reasoning","When a ball drops down into one curved tube, preschoolers tend to search for the ball in the location directly below the entrance to the tube, even if they are not connected to each other. The search error has been interpreted as a gravity bias (Hood, 1995). Based on Hood's tubes task, Experiment 1 investigated whether initial direction of movement and drop-ball procedure influenced the gravity bias. Children observed a ball drop down the designated tube in one of three conditions that differed in entrance angle to the tube (0°, 45°, or 90°). They observed an experimenter drop the ball in the first block of trials, and then dropped the ball themselves in the second block. The results showed that most children failed to find the ball and tended to search the vertical aligned box. The gravity bias was worse when children dropped the ball themselves in the 90° condition. In Experiment 2, we reversed the block sequence and found that the block difference was not observed as previously shown in the 90° condition. Thus, the expectation that objects fall in a straight line seems to be modulated not only by perceptual information about the task but also by cognitive resources recruited by the drop-ball procedures.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201506-201506260027-201506260027-145-154,57.2,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology

However, most previous research focused on examining that people learned the same behavior from peers, but rarely examined the generalized effects. In order to fill this theoretical gap, we based on social learning theory and considered positive and negative behavior at the same time, explored the influence of peers' service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (positive behavior) and service sabotage (negative behavior) on individual service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior and service sabotage, and examined the moderating effects of moral leadership and self-esteem. 539 frontline employees in 40 hotels were enrolled in this study. The results showed that peer service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior was positively related to individual service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior. Peer service sabotage was positively related to individual service sabotage, but negatively related to service-oriented organizational citizenship behavior. In addition, moral leadership and self-esteem would moderate the relationship between peer service sabotage and individual service sabotage.

The Effect of Semantic Relatedness between Storage and Processing on Working Memory,"Hsiang-Chun Chen, Yu-Han Kao, Yuh-Shiow Lee","cognitive load, semantic relatedness, naming span task",Most working memory theories focus on the competition in attentional resources between the processing and storage components of a complex span task. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of semantic relationship between the processing and storage tasks on the span performance. Here we report three within-subjects experiments manipulating both cognitive load and semantic relatedness between the processing and storage tasks within a naming span task. Experiment 1 found that semantic relatedness enhanced participants' span performance. Experiment 2 showed that the beneficial effect of semantic relatedness was disappeared after the presentation duration of processing items within a test trial was reduced. Experiment 3 controlled the semantic relatedness of processing items and also found the beneficial effect of semantic relatedness between the processing and storage tasks. These findings demonstrated that semantic relatedness and cognitive load have independent contribution to memory performance.

In Buddhism, the self-concept for ordinary people is nothing but a convenient label, sothe answer is yes. We used the modified Stroop paradigm to examine this. Participants were restricted to those whosefamily names are ＂黃＂, meaning ＂yellow＂ in English. In Experiment 1, the Chinese character ＂我＂, meaning ＂I＂ and referringto self, was displayedin yellow or blue, and used to elicit self. Participants were asked to respond to the ink color. If selfnameis concomitant with self, a Stroop effect on the colored word ＂I＂ (shorter reaction times to yellow ＂I＂ than blue ＂I＂) would be found. Results showed that was the case. In Experiment 2, the participants' own faceswere used to elicit self, eitherconsciously or unconsciously. Results showed that self was accompanied by self-name only when elicited consciously.

This study investigated two concrete research questions: Do EC and HEXACO personality traits have any direct effects on IPBs and EPBs? Does EC moderate the influence of HEXACO personality t raits on IPBs and EPBs? Two-year follow-up research was conducted with 1,375 adolescents, ages 13 and 16. In the first year (T1), the Early Adolescent Temperament Questionnaire and HEXACO-PI-R were the main instruments used to measure adolescents’ EC and personality dimensions. In the first and second years (T1 and T2), the Youth Self-Report was employed to measure adolescents' IPBs and EPBs. All the research predictions were tested through correlation analyses and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The results showed that emotionality and extraversion directly affected the IPBs, while honesty/humility, agreeableness, and EC directly affected EPBs.

First, we wanted to explore the imitation performance in children under 4 years of age with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Second, we planned to explore the abilities related to different imitation tasks in children with ASD. The participants were 92 children, including 49 children with ASD (chronological age: 25 to 50 months, mental age: 10.5 to 47.25 months), 22 children with developmental delay (chronological age: 25 to 47 months, mental age: 18.25 to 38.5 months), and 21 infants with typical development (chronological age: 18 to 30 months, mental age: 19.5 to 33.75 months). Four tasks were used for evaluating imitation abilities, including meaningful action on objects, nonmeaningful action on objects, meaningful manual movement and nonmeaningful manual movement. In addition, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (Lord, Rutter, DiLavore & Risi, 1999) was used to assess autistic symptoms of children with ASD. The results of the current study revealed that the children with ASD showed significant impairment compared to the children with developmental delay on all imitation tasks. However, compared to toddlers with typical development, children with ASD performed with significant impairment on both meaningful action on objects and nonmeaningful action on objects but not on meaningful manual movement and nonmeaningful manual movement. Based on the developmental quotient, children with ASD were divided into high-functioning and lowfunctioning groups. The current study also revealed that high-functioning children with ASD performed without significant impairment on meaningful action on objects, but low-functioning children with ASD showed significant impairment on all imitation tasks. All of the imitation abilities were significantly related to different developmental and social abilities, including mental age, verbal mental age, nonverbal mental age, receptive language, expressive language, responding joint attention, and autistic symptoms. However, the relations between the imitative abilities and developmental abilities, language, responding joint attention and autistic symptoms supported that imitative abilities play an important role in the development of social and cognitive skills, and provide a direction for an early intervention program for children with ASD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201503-201503240046-201503240046-45-66,57.1,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Temporal Characteristics of the Collinear Masking Effect in Visual Search,"Ching-Wen Chiu, Li Jingling","attention, visual search, masking, perceptual grouping, time course","A salient target is usually easier to find in visual search. However, perceptual grouping, collinearity in particular, can reverse this observation. The phenomenon, called the collinear masking effect, was observed for a search display that was filled with horizontal bars while a column of bars were vertical (the collinear column). This collinear column thus is salient and well-grouped. The task was to discriminate a small oriented bar either in the collinear column or in other columns in the background. The collinear masking effect refers to the phenomenon that discrimination was slower for a target on the collinear column comparing to that in the background. Since feature saliency affect visual search in relatively early (e.g., 40 to 70 ms) while feature conjunctions late (e.g., 150 to 300 ms) in information process stages, we examined the time course of the collinear masking effect in this study. With limited presentation durations (40, 70, 150, or 300 ms), different masks lead to different results. Nevertheless, the collinear masking effect was observed at the time point when the target discrimination was above chance level. Further experiment showed that if the search display was presented preceded the target, reliable collinear masking effect was obtained as early as 40 ms. We thus concluded that the collinear masking effect can be found in 40 to 70 ms. Our results imply that the collinear masking effect occurred as fast as saliency was calculated, suggesting that collinear grouping interferes with visual search very early in the information processing stream.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201503-201503240046-201503240046-91-107,57.1,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology

In animal studies, episodic-like memory is defined as the ability to remember what happened where and when. A previous study showed that rats with lesions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) failed to form an episodic-like memory for a fear conditioning event, indicating that the mPFC might play a crucial role. However, details about how mPFC is involved in the encoding process remain unknown. In this study, we temporarily deactivated mPFC of rats at different time points during the memory encoding procedures, and observed how the episodic-like memory of a fear conditioning event was influenced. We found that mPFC deactivation in the preexposure phase didn't interfere with the formation of time-context paired associations, while manipulation before foot-shock impaired the episodic-like memory. Subsequent experiments excluded the alternative interpretations that temporary mPF C deactivation impaired the more basic Pavlovian fear conditioning. The results are consistent with the idea that episodic encoding is a reorganization of mnemonic elements, in which mPFC is involved.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201503-201503240046-201503240046-109-120,57.1,2015,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Behavioral and verbal representations adopted from Karmiloff-Smith's RR model were examined. In this study, 286 young children aged 3 to 6 years solved 3 physics-dynamics problems in the context of 1 source story and 2 target stories read to the children by experimenters. The children failing to solve the problem in the source story at the pretest were randomly assigned to 1 of 6 prompt conditions or the control group. The children were administered posttests immediately following and 2 weeks after the treatment. The results revealed that most of the 3-to-6-year-old children did not have the 2-dimensional verbal representations required to solve the problems. However, verbal explanations modified the young children's representations from behavioral to verbal. However, the positive effect of the prompts did not transfer to the solving of the 2-dimensional transfer problems. This finding seemed to indicate that the young children's ability to solve 2-dimensional problems was derived from interplay between the external prompts and the children's development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201412-201412260013-201412260013-383-396,56.4,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Lexical-Tone Perception and Word Learning Abilities in Two-Year-Old Late-Talking Children,"Hsin-Hui Lu, Feng-Ming Tsao","late talker, lexical-tone perception, word learning","The late-talking (LT) 2-year-old toddlers perform delayed vocabulary skills compared to their peers. Speech perception skills are essential to vocabulary development. For example, infants' speech perception abilities facilitate word learning, and speech perception in early infancy is predictive of later vocabulary development at 2-3 years of age. Lexical tones manifest the lexical meanings of syllables in Mandarin and are essential for typically-developing infants to learn words. Typically-developing 2-3 year-old children produce four lexical tones, but it is still an open issue regarding to the effects of lexical tone perception on word learning in Mandarin LT toddler. The goal of this study was to investigate whether the lexical-tone perception ability was associated with the word-learning performance in Mandarin-speaking LT toddlers. The participants were 2-year-old LT children (n=34) and typically-developing children (TD, n=34), matched with gender, chronological age, major language at home, and birth order. The lexical-tone perception ability was assessed with the forced-choice picture-pointing task, in which the child had to discriminate the lexical-tone minimal word pairs and map words with corresponding pictures. The word-learning efficiency was assessed with the referent-selection and the word retention tasks. Results showed that the LT group performed poorer than the TD group in lexical-tone perception and word-learning efficiency. For the LT group, results of the correlation analyses showed that lexical-tone perception was correlated with word-learning efficiency. For the TD group, lexical-tone perception was correlated with vocabulary size and syntactic complexity. For the LT group, the stepwise regression analyses showed that the word-learning efficiency could only be accounted for by lexical-tone perception. For the TD group, the results showed that the word-learning efficiency could be accounted for by vocabulary size and word using. The results demonstrate the poor lexical-tone perception ability in Taiwanese LT children. Moreover, the LT group's lexical-tone perception is associated with the word-learning efficiency, suggesting that the fragile lexical-tone representation could adversely affect the word-learning efficiency in LT.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201412-201412260013-201412260013-415-435,56.4,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Experimental data were fit by a reinforcement learning model using the Bayesian estimation approach. We also correlated subjects' performance with their personality traits assessed by the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ). Matching law analysis revealed that males are more sensitive than females, meaning that males are better than females in choosing the advantageous card. Model fitting together with Bayes factors revealed that females update their values slightly faster than males, indicating that females have the tendency to give the trial-by-trial prediction error more weight. Further, females showed less perseveration than males, indicating that females tend to explore the uncertainty of future events more often. We also found that females' learning rate is negatively correlated with their task performance, whereas both males and females' degree of perseveration is positively correlated with their task scores. These results indicate that on average, males have a more 'optimal' learning rate and a larger degree of perseveration than females, providing a plausible explanation of why males performed slightly better than females in the task. Regarding the relation of task performance and personality traits, correlational analysis revealed that females with higher scores in ＂extravagance＂ (which is in the novelty-seeking dimension of TPQ) have lower value-updating rates. Moreover, females with higher scores in ＂attachment＂ (which is in the reward-dependence dimension of TPQ) have lower degrees of perseveration. No such findings were found in males.

Focus Size of Attention: Exploring the Focus Hypothesis on the Collinear Masking Effect in Visual Search,"Ching-Wen Chiu, Jing-Ling Li","visual search, salience, attentional capture, attention focus, perceptual grouping","In searching for an item in our visual field, a salient or a behaviorally relevant item usually captures our attention. However, Jingling and Tseng (2013) reported an interesting finding that a salient target is actually more difficult to identify than a non-salient target. This novel phenomenon was observed in a specific search display, which was filled with regularly aligned small bars. The salient structure was formed by several bars collinear to each other. When the target was on the salient collinear structure, search was more difficult than when the target was in the background, which is called collinear masking effect. Since the target was a small bar while the collinear structure was longer, they may elicit different focus size and disagree to each other. The goal of this study was to test whether the disagreement on focus size can explain the collinear masking effect. We manipulated the size of the target and the size of the collinear structure systematically. Results of five experiments consistently showed the collinear masking effect regardless of the size of the target. These results argue against the focus size hypothesis. We thus conclude that the collinear masking effect might be associated with other perceptual properties rather than the size of the attention focus.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201412-201412260013-201412260013-467-484,56.4,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology

In the face of the declines with age in brain structure volume, cortical thickness, and white matter integrity, functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated increased neural activation in prefrontal and parietal regions across different cognitive domains in older adults. These results suggest that the aging brain retains considerable plasticity of function and is adaptive in response to cognitive challenges posed by structural deterioration.

However, this task requires the ability to effectively process phonological information, which could be challenging for young children, whose phonological systems are still in development. This study proposes that in addition to phonological storage, phonological analysis constrains young children's NWR performance. Sixty 4-to 5-year-old children were tested on vocabulary size, productive phonology, phonological awareness, digit span, articulation rate, and NWR. Regression analyses revealed that productive phonology was the major predictor of NWR, while digit span made a minor contribution. Error analyses showed that the children's individual differences resided in their ability to encode nonwords into appropriate phonological units. The findings indicate that phonological analysis and phonological storage are the two major factors contributing to the children's performance in encoding novel forms.

Later on, influenced by the ideology of emic approach and cultural psychology, researchers changed their interest to cross-cultural and indigenous studies. After years of efforts, indigenous leadership theory now becomes an emerging and prosperous topic in global research society. Echoing to this evolution, in this article, we first review the development of leadership studies in Taiwan, and then analyze overall findings. Meanwhile, we briefly introduce five inspiring review papers, which focus on specific leadership topic individually, compiled in this special issue. Lastly, future research agenda is blueprinted and indigenous flavor is addressed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201406-201407090002-201407090002-135-147,56.2,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Moral Leadership: An Indigenous Construct or a Universal Phenomenon?,An-Chih Wang,"paternalistic leadership, moral leadership, ethical leadership","Since Farh & Cheng (2000) proposed moral leadership as one of the dimensions of Chinese paternalistic leadership, it has been considered an indigenous leadership construct emerged from Confucian doctrine of self-cultivation. For the past ten years, several important follow-up studies have clarified the nature of it and evidenced its favorable effects on subordinate performance. As this leadership construct gradually developed, Western scholars also defined a similar term, ethical leadership, as a leader's normatively appropriate conduct and his or her promotion of such morality. When Western literature on leadership further traced ethical leadership to Aristotle's philosophy, researchers interested in Chinese moral leadership started to wonder whether moral leadership is truly an indigenous leadership construct that only exists in Chinese settings. To probe this question, I first review literature on moral leadership and that on ethical leadership separately, and then compare these two constructs from three perspectives: (1) cultural origins, (2) underlying mechanisms, and (3) behavioral demonstration. Accordingly, I propose a framework that integrates the two leadership constructs. I argue that at the definition and the conceptualization level, moral or ethical leadership is universal and can be observed across different cultural settings. However, its dimensions and explicit display are culture-specific; it consists of disparate sets of behavioral patterns in different contexts. Based on this newly proposed framework, I identify several fruitful future research directions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201406-201407090002-201407090002-149-164,56.2,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Authoritarian Leadership: A Review and Agenda for Future Research,"Wan-Ju Chou, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Yu-Hui Lien","paternalistic authority, authoritarian leadership, dominance-submission relationship, hierarchical order","Authoritarian leadership (AL) is a beginning of Chinese leadership research. It is also an important element of triad model of paternalistic leadership. In the past thirty years, numerous researches have accumulated and AL has received growing interest in recent years. However, it is surprising that there is no review paper focus on AL. In lacking of a holistic guide and critical review on AL, it is hard to create new knowledge and develop or elaborate extant theory. Accordingly, the purpose of this article is to share findings and enhance understanding from a literature review of the ongoing theoretical and empirical research on AL. We first tracing back to the cultural background wherein AL emerged and next providing an overall picture of major advances and emerging patterns in this research domain over the last decades. Lastly, we summarize and evaluate the contributions and limitations of previous research, and propose a roadmap for future research by addressing some frontier issues. On the basis of this systematic review, we try to advance our knowledge of AL and draw with an agenda for theoretical development and empirical research exploration.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201406-201407090002-201407090002-165-189,56.2,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Abusive Supervision: Retrospect and Prospect,"Chang-Ya Hu, Ying-Ni Cheng","work behavior, abusive supervision, organizational justice, Chinese organizational behavior","Since Tepper’s (2000) pioneering work on abusive supervision, this topic has become prevalent in the research domain of negative leader behavior. In this review article, we aim to provide an integrated model of abusive supervision for future research. We first discuss the nomological network of abusive supervision by introducing its definition, content, measurement, and construct validity evidence. We then discuss the possible meaning of abusive supervision under Chinese culture context by comparing abusive supervision studies conducted in the Western context with the studies conducted in the Chinese context. Finally, we propose recommendations for future study, especially those in the context of Chinese organizations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201406-201407090002-201407090002-191-214,56.2,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Values-Fit Based Charismatic Leadership Theory: The Mediation Process and Multilevel Analysis,"Min-Ping Huang, Feng-Hsia Kao","charismatic leadership, cross-cultural, values-fit, multilevel, the mediation process","Recently, charismatic leadership has become one of the important topics in the academic research. From the theoretical viewpoint, charismatic leaders are able to change subordinates' needs, values, self-concepts and goals, and further influence subordinates' emotion and cognitive responses. This is a leadership process regarding subordinates' values change. However, up to now there is no theory to completely explain how leaders can transform subordinates' value to fit into leader's values and group values, and further enhance employees' and organizational effectiveness. In order to fill up this theoretical gap, based on the perspective of multilevel values-fit, we developed a theoretical model and provided propositions to explain the dual mediation paths of charismatic leadership. In addition, we reviewed charismatic leadership studies in Taiwan in order to explore the cross-cultural implications of our values-fit charismatic leadership theory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201406-201407090002-201407090002-215-235,56.2,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
It's about Time: A Review of Research on Time and Leadership,"Tzu-Ting Lin, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","temporal perspective, leadership, leaders, time","Time should be an important aspect of organizational theory, but it has been neglected for decades, especially in leadership research. In order to consider leadership from a temporal perspective, we examine extant leadership research, namely leader and leadership that refers to temporal variables in its theorizing and/or empirical testing. We also specify some directions about how future theory development and refinement should incorporate time. By doing so, we hope to encourage future researchers to get involved in and invest in leadership research on time issues.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201406-201407090002-201407090002-237-255,56.2,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
A Longitudinal Study of Association Strength and Semantic Transparency in Semantic Processing of Chinese Characters in Children,"Shu-Hui Lee, Kuo-Chung Hung, Tai-Li Chou","semantic, auditory, development, semantic transparency, association strength","This study examined the developmental changes in association strength (i.e., the degree of semantic relation between two characters) and semantic transparency (i.e., the degree of semantic relation between the semantic radical and the whole character) in a cross-modal semantic judgment task. Character pairs were presented in the visual and auditory modality sequentially to determine the mapping between phonology and orthography. A longitudinal approach was used to study a group of Chinese children aged 9 to 15 years (age 1), and 11 to 17 years (age 2). Association strength (strong, weak) and semantic transparency (high, low) were independently varied to study semantic processing. Participants were asked to decide whether two Chinese characters were related in meaning. There were two main results in the current study. First, children performed better on accuracy for high relative to low transparency in the strong association, reflecting the differences of semantic constraint to perform semantic judgments in the strong association. Second, our results showed a reduced difference in accuracy for high than for low transparency for age 2, compared to that of age 1. These findings demonstrate developmental changes from a focus on radical components (i.e., sublexical processing) to a focus on whole characters (i.e., lexical processing) and the development of more efficient bi-directional links between the radical and the character, which accelerates access to semantic representations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-1-11,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Effects of Trait Anger and Cognitive Strategies on State Anger in Fifth- and Sixth-Grade Children,"Wan-Ling Chung, Fu-Chien Hung, Pei-Yung Liang","rumination, trait anger, distraction, anger regulation, state anger","The present study aims to investigate the influence of trait anger and cognitive strategies on induced state anger in elementary school-aged children. Sixty-eight children with high trait anger and sixty-seven children with low trait anger participated in this study. An anger induction procedure involving guided recall (i.e., recalling an anger-provoking memory) was used to induce angry moods in participants. Following this, participants were instructed to either ruminate on the anger-provoking memory or engage in distraction for 2 minutes. Participants' levels of state anger were measured at three time points: before and after the anger induction and after the anger regulation manipulation (i.e., rumination or distraction). The results revealed that the high trait anger group had a higher level of state anger before and after the anger induction as compared with the low trait anger group. The two groups did not differ with respect to the magnitude of change in the state anger following anger induction. Moreover, for both the groups, participants in the rumination condition reported a higher level of state anger than participants in the distraction condition, following anger regulation manipulations. The present study suggests that rumination may maintain or increase anger, whereas distraction may help to decrease anger. Implications of these findings for the intervention with children who are experiencing difficulty with anger regulation are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-13-29,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Employment Relationship: The Study of Organizational Disidentification and Workplace Deviance,"Chien-Chih Kuo, Man Su, Kirk Chang","employment relationship, organizational disidentification, psychological contract breach, abusive supervision, workplace deviance","The current study was designed to test the relationship of negative employment relationship (psychological contract breach and abusive supervision) with workplace deviance, and to examine the mediating role of organizational disidentification. The data were collected from 301 employees in the several industries, such as Semiconductor, Manufacture, Service and Chemistry in Taiwan. As expected, a positive relationship was found between psychological contract breach, abusive supervision and organizational disidentification. In addition, it was found that organizational disidentification was positively related to workplace deviance. It showed that organizational disidentification mediates the relationship between negative employment relationship and workplace deviance. The results offered general support for the applicability of the organizational identification theory to the person-organization employment relationship in the workplace. Further discussion focuses on theoretical and practical implications of the observed outcomes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-31-47,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Orthographic Inhibition between Characters with Identical Semantic Radicals in Primed Character Decision Tasks,"Fu-Ling Yang, Jei-Tun Wu","orthographic priming, semantic priming, semantic radical, orthographic inhibition, character recognition","In two primed character decision experiments, one with 243 ms SOA and the other with 43 ms SOA, we examined the effects of semantic priming, orthographic priming, frequency in target characters, and neighborhood density in target characters. Following results were obtained by both the experiments: (1) Compared with semantically unrelated conditions, semantic priming effects were observed in semantically related prime-target pairs; (2) compared with radically unrelated conditions, orthographic inhibition was observed in the prime condition where the prime and the target shared a common semantic radical. Moreover, orthographic inhibition occurred only in high-frequency target characters and not in low-frequency target characters; (3) Compared with low-frequency target characters, high-frequency target characters responded more quickly and correctly; (4) neighborhood density had a negligible effect on target character decisions. Priming effects between characters with identical semantic radicals in our study were character-level effects, rather than radical-level effects. Because the same prime types were adopted as those in the study by Feldman and Siok (1999a), the present findings question the early semantic activation of radicals as suggested by their study, which supported the notion that radical processing is a constitutive element of character recognition and precedes meaning access in the identification process. Instead, the present results suggest that the semantics of radicals is optional for accessing meaning in Chinese character recognition among skilled adult readers. Thus, we propose the idea that in primed character decisions, semantic radicals act as orthographic units rather than semantic units.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-49-63,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
A Longitudinal Study of Semantic Association and Categorical Relatedness on Children's Semantic Processing of Chinese Characters,"Ciao-Han Wong, Shiou-Yuan Chen, Tai-Li Chou","semantic development, semantic association, categorical relatedness","Previous developmental studies with regard to semantic processing used cross-sectional approaches to examine developmental changes and did not make distinctions between semantic association and categorical relatedness. Semantic association was defined as character pairs produced by free association tasks; categorical relatedness was referred to character pairs within the same semantic category. The present study used a longitudinal approach to further investigate the roles of semantic association and categorical relatedness in the developmental changes of semantic processing. We orthogonally manipulated semantic association (strong, weak) and categorical relatedness (high, low) to examine developmental changes of 11-year-old children in a two-year interval. Children were asked to decide whether two visually-presented Chinese characters were semantically related and tested again two years later. There were two main results. First, the main effect of time was significant. Children performed better on accuracy of the second measure as compared with the first measure. Second, we found an interaction between semantic association and categorical relatedness on accuracy. The difference between the high and low categorical relatedness was significant for the strong semantic association, not for the weak semantic association. The difference between the strong and weak semantic association was significant for the high categorical relatedness, not for the low categorical relatedness. There are two implications in the present study. First, as age increased, accumulated learning experiences may enhance children to build more elaborate semantic representations. They may use more abstract manners to integrate different categorical relationships. Second, the interaction of semantic association and categorical relatedness suggests that semantic knowledge may be organized by both semantic association and categorical relatedness. The stable semantic enhancement is based on characters with strong semantic association and high categorical relatedness.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-65-81,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Backward Inference Processing of Jokes: Evidence from Eye Movement,"Ya-Ching Su, Chao-Ming Cheng, Hsueh-Chih Chen","backward inference process, regression, opposition-coherence theory, joke comprehension","All jokes contain incongruity between set-up sentences and punch lines. People who read jokes that require more inferences will spend more time resolving the incongruity by making connections between the set-up sentences and the punch line. The opposition-coherence theory of humor (Chen, Cheng, & Cho, 2001) proposes backward inference, defined as the inference directed to parts of text preceding the inference, as an important component of humor processes. The present study examined how backward inference processing affects humor comprehension in two eye-tracking experiments with participants reading jokes at difficult levels. In experiment 1, we examined effects of each of three difficulty levels on humor comprehension. We compared eye movements with provided inference, simple inference, and complex inference jokes with differing punch lines and of varying difficulty. The participants spent a longer time for total viewing and made more regressions for the complex condition than for the provided condition. Results are consistent with the prediction regarding backward inference, suggesting that readers literally revisit aspects of the prior context while apprehending jokes. In experiment 2, we examined effects of resolution on humor comprehension by investigating whether the punch line can resolve the incongruity in incongruity-resolution and incongruity-irresolution conditions. Results showed that participants made more regressions and needed longer total viewing time for the incongruity-irresolution condition than for the incongruity-resolution condition. This finding suggested that participants searched for and took 4 regressions before terminating comprehension. The results mentioned above support the process of backward inferences and provide information about eye movement patterns of joke comprehension.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-83-95,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Assessing Consonant Perception Ability and Its Association with Reading Development in School-Aged Children with Reading Difficulty,"Lu-Yang Li, Feng-Ming Tsao","children with reading difficulty, consonant perception, speech perception, release from masking","Previous studies have shown controversial results regarding whether lower graders with reading difficulty would encounter problems in speech perception. Furthermore, if these children had shown deficits in speech perception, no consistent conclusion was reached about whether the deficits resulted from general auditory processing or specific impairment in speech perception. The present study focused on Mandarin-speaking children with reading difficulty and aimed at investigating the correlation between their reading ability and speech perception, especially consonant perception. Eight to nine year-old children with reading difficulty (RD) (n = 20) were recruited along with a control group consisting of age and non-verbal IQ matched children (n = 20). These participants were tested with a consonant identification task. Through manipulating the modulation frequency of amplitude modulated (AM) noise in the background, the study attempted to look into the ”release from masking” effect. The effect was later utilized to see whether limited general auditory processing would lead to the poor performance in consonant perception. The results showed that children with RD performed less accurately in identifying consonants than the matched-group children. The ”release from masking” effect, that is, the decrease of modulated frequency in AM noise enhancing the percent corrects of identifying consonants, was not affected by group difference. The results suggest that the auditory processing ability of children with RD is similar to that of normal reading children. In addition, correlation and regression analyses both demonstrated a strong association between speech perception performance and reading ability. In conclusion, the results showed the consonant perception deficit in Mandarin-speaking children with RD; also, for the lower graders, there was a close relationship between speech perception and overall reading performance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-97-116,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Defensive Reactions and Automatic Emotion Regulation of Defensive High Self-Esteems under Threaten Situation,"Wen-Zi Lo, Kuang-Hui Yeh","secure high self-esteem, defensive high self-esteems, explicit self-esteems, automatic emotion regulation, implicit self-esteem","According to different conscious level, we can distinguish self-esteem into explicit and implicit aspects. Individuals with high explicit self-esteem but low implicit self-esteem are called defensive high self-esteems (defensive HSE), in addition, individuals with both high explicit and implicit self-esteem are called secure high self-esteems (secure HSE). In this study, by comparing these two types of self-esteems' behavioral responses in threatening situations and automatic emotion regulations to negative emotion, we can further elaborate the heterogeneity of high self-esteem appearance. Study1 which included 20 secure HSEs and 20 defensive HSEs tested that defensive HSE in face of threat stimuli will present more defensive reactions than do secure HSE. By manipulating two kinds of feedback situations (positive vs. negative feedback), the study 1 found that, in the receiving negative feedback, defensive HSE evaluated the source of threat (pseudo-intelligence tests) more negative than did secure HSE, and more to belittle outgroup (private students) score. In study 2 which included 18 secure HSEs and 17 defensive HSEs, we further explored whether self engage in negative emotion would cause different regulation time to two types of high self-esteems. By using modified affective priming task, we found that when priming subliminal self, defensive HSE's automatic negative emotion regulation is slower than that of secure HSE, and is also slower than that of secure HSE in positive emotion regulation situation. These findings did not show in none subliminal self primes. This study discussed that defensive HSE possess positive self views at public level but at implicit level they feel relatively negative about themselves that are fragile to threat, leading them uneasy to regulate their negative emotional state.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201403-201404020003-201404020003-117-134,56.1,2014,Chinese Journal of Psychology

In responding to this need, the Psychology Section in Department of Humanity and Social Sciences, National Science Council launched a promotion project in 2008 entitled as ”A Study on Standard Stimuli and Normative Responses of Emotion in Taiwan,” to construct sets of emotional stimuli on facial expression, pictures, words, metaphors, jokes, intonation of speech, music, as well as film clips and to evaluate their valence, arousal or dominance level and to measure the neural and physiological responses to them. Results gathered from this project formed the ”Taiwan Corpora of Chinese Emotions and Psychophysiological Data” and were made available for research use on EmotioNet (http://ssnre.psy.ntu.edu.tw). Articles published in this special issue describe the construction procedure and evaluation results for each set of the stimuli serving as reference for users to select stimuli.

A Structure Analysis of Chinese Emotions,"Chao-Ming Cheng, Chao-Ming Cheng, Shu-Ling Cho, Hsueh-Chih Chen","category of Chinese emotion, structure of Chinese emotions, additive tree representation of emotion structure, nearest neighbor analysis","The structure of Chinese emotions was studied by first searching as exhaustively as possible those Chinese emotion words that were used by present-day Chinese in everyday life situations, excluding those of arousal, selforiented emotion, and emotion-change words. A total of 305 terms were thus collected and then classified into 30 categories of emotion, including the 10 categories, which are claimed to be important and primary across Confucian school, Buddhism, and traditional Chinese medicine, and the other 20 categories. The 30 categories and their superordinate concept, emotion, formed a total of 465 pairs for participants in Experiment 1 to rate the similarity of each paired items on a 11-point scale. Resultant 31 × 31 similarity data matrix was then analyzed by a 2- and 3-dimensional scaling and an additive tree clustering method. Results of a nearest neighbor analysis show that the centrality and reciprocity computed from the additive tree solution fitted those of observed data much better than did those computed from the multidimensional scaling solutions. The additive tree model was also supported by the finding of Experiment 2 that the model was sensitive to a change in structure by revealing a change in centrality and reciprocity. The results of the additive tree analysis suggest that the 30 Chinese emotion categories can be grouped into 8 different clusters based on the features of evaluation, arousal level, kind of threat, arousal level caused by threat, target of emotional reaction. The 8 clusters are discussed with the 7 primary emotions proposed by the three oriental theories of 7-emotions and Ekman's (1972) 6 basic emotions",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201312-201312310030-201312310030-417-438,55.4,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Among them, the most representative 1,232 frontal view, 514 3/4 view and 527 profile images from all models were each rated by 50 ~ 100 human observers for the category and intensity of perceived emotion.

The study consists of two parts. In Part 1, we employed a standard procedure and collected a wide range of facial images representing expressions of basic emotions from 48 college students who served as models, half males and half females. Following that, we established a norm for each kind of basic emotions, consisting of relatively strong and relatively weak expressions, based on subjective behavioral ratings from another group of 170 participants. The results of rating were used to classify each facial expression into different categories in accordance with criteria of intensity and plurality, and the mean value of entropy also was calculated for each category of facial expressions according to intensity rating. In Part 2, we collected facial expressions of basic emotions from 65 college students (both graduate and undergraduate), 33 males and 32 females, who served as models under naturalistic settings. Experimental procedure was used to induce emotional reactions from the models, from which images of facial expressions were extracted. The naturalistic facial expressions were later rated by another group of 84 participants. As in Part 1, the results of rating were used to categorize facial expressions into basic emotions and to calculate their respective entropy values of each category. The database of facial expressions for basic emotions established in the present study can provide a valuable research tool for investigators who are interested in studying facial expressions and issues related to emotional processing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201312-201312310030-201312310030-455-475,55.4,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The subjective ratings of emotional pictures by Taiwanese participants were used to establish a norm. The ratings included the dimensions of valence, arousal, dominance, and complexity. Participants were also asked to choose an adjective to describe each picture, and to identify the area of interest. TAPS currently consists of 1,058 pictures in 19 categories which can be used to elicit emotions in future studies and is still undergoing expansion. The affective space takes the shape of a boomerang, with arousal and valence ratings plotted on the X and Y axes, respectively. This result is similar to that of the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). However, unlike the IAPS, the male and female participants in this study did not show difference on either positive or negative bias in the affective space. Furthermore, the participants tended to rate the erotic pictures as neutral in valence but high in arousal level. Therefore, although the IAPS is used worldwide, considering the cultural differences in emotional reaction to pictures, TAPS is better suited for use in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201312-201312310030-201312310030-477-492,55.4,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

It started first with a collection of emotion words. The words were collected mainly from four sources: (1) an analysis of the Sinica Balanced Corpus; (2) emotion words used in theses for master degrees; (3) analyses of Chinese dictionaries by emotion types defined across dimensions of Chinese culture such as Confucianism, Buddhism, and Traditional Chinese Medicine; and (4) free associations of the six basic emotion words from 120 college students. As an emotion word can either describe an emotional state or induce it, all collected words were categorized into emotion-describing and emotion-inducing words. Our analyses yielded a total of 218 emotion-describing words and 395 emotion-inducing words. In the second stage, on a 9-point Likert scale, 353 participants rated each of the emotion-describing words for valence, arousal, continuance, dominance, frequency, and typicality; 1,673 participants rated each of the emotion-inducing words for valence, continuance, dominance and frequency. As significant gender differences were noted in the subjective feeling for certain emotion words, the means and standard deviations of ratings in the database are presented respectively for the entire sample and separately for both genders. The third stage of the study analyzed the two types of words on their clustering in various dimensions. The main findings were: (1) for emotion-describing words, valence had the highest correlations with dominance and frequency, arousal had higher correlations with typicality, but had a small negative correlation with continuance and dominance. Frequency had medium to high positive correlation with all of the dimensions except for arousal, with which no significant correlation was found. (2) Each of all four dimensions rated for emotion-inducing words had medium to high positive correlation with the other three, in which valence and dominance had the strongest correlation. (3) Two methods of K-means cluster analysis (classify-only and classify with-iteration) were used to categorize the emotion words. (a) The first method (classify-only) with the six basic emotion words as centroids revealed that 21.1%, 21.8% of the words had a distance greater than 2 from the centroids. (b) When classified with iteration, 1.8%, 1.5% of the words had a distance greater than 2 from the final centroids. Further, after iteration the six basic emotion words were classified into three to four groups. A possible implication is that we need more research for basic emotional types in Chinese culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201312-201312310030-201312310030-493-523,55.4,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

This research was based on a stratified sample of 1,128 college students in Taiwan. An emotion metaphor task was used to collect participants' responses that involved metaphors. The task divided emotion metaphors into four types (sensation metaphors, event metaphors, object metaphors and personality metaphors). Within each type, participants were asked to generate various kinds of metaphoric responses according to ten emotional categories with different valences (positive: happiness, love, pride, comfort; neutral: calm, surprise; negative: sadness, fear, anger, disgust). Participants' responses were recorded, and both commonality and idiosyncrasy were calculated for the different types of metaphoric stimuli (sensation, event, object, personality). A qualitative analysis of the resulting data revealed that participants gave various metaphoric responses to different kinds of emotion in different types of metaphor. For example, for sensation metaphors for happiness, the prime response was incense; for event metaphors for happiness, the prime response was having a journey; for object metaphors for happiness, the prime response was friend; and for the personality metaphor for happiness, the highest response was open-mindedness. Interestingly, participants generated quite distinct responses in the negative metaphor set. For instance, for the sensation metaphor for fear, the prime response was ”black” (color); for the event metaphor for fear, the prime response was exam; for the object metaphor for fear, the prime response was ghost; and for the personality metaphor for fear, the prime response was timidity. Additionally, commonality and idiosyncrasy were also compared across the four categories of metaphoric stimuli. In sum, this study established a norm of Taiwanese metaphoric responses, which can be employed for further research on emotions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201312-201312310030-201312310030-525-553,55.4,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Taiwan Corpora of Chinese Emotions and Relevant Psychophysiological Data-Normative Data for Chinese Jokes,"Chao-Ming Cheng, Hsueh-Chih Chen, Yu-Chen Chan, Ya-Ching Su, Chien-Chih Tseng","funniness, joke norms, aversiveness, comprehensibility","A joke is defined as a short script designed to induce humorous or funny feelings in readers. In comparison to other emotional stimuli, jokes can quickly induce intense, positive emotions, making them effective as stimuli for emotional manipulations. Although corpora of humorous stimuli including jokes and cartoons are well-established in various languages, cultural differences may affect joke comprehension and appreciation, potentially rendering material in other languages inappropriate for Chinese-speaking subjects. In this study, we first gathered 160 Chinese jokes representative of various types, and invited 396 participants over the age of 15 to take an on-line questionnaire to evaluate the ”comprehensibility,” ”funniness,” and ”aversiveness” of each joke using a 1 ~ 9 point scale. The results for ”funniness” showed a normal distribution with a centered mean, for both funny and unfunny jokes. The results for ”comprehensibility” showed a strong negative skew, demonstrating that most jokes were comprehensible, while the results for ”aversiveness” were positively skewed, indicating that aversive feelings were not commonly evoked by the jokes. Additionally, aversiveness, comprehensibility and funniness ratings showed high positive correlations, while funniness and aversiveness had a high negative correlation, and comprehensibility and aversiveness showed a low negative correlation. Finally, analysis revealed that the ratings for comprehensibility, funniness and aversiveness all differed significantly according to the gender of the reader. Therefore, results were established separately by gender. The corpus of jokes and joke-ratings can be utilized in future experiments using eye-tracking, biofeedback and brain imaging.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201312-201312310030-201312310030-555-569,55.4,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The scope of this research includes: (1) constructing a database of emotion-triggering music stimuli, and the felt emotions of the listeners; (2) inspecting the emotion spectrum induced by music; (3) evaluating the differences in music emotions across three age groups. Non-musical factors were carefully controlled in the selection of 240 music clips. Felt emotions of the listeners were measured on 20 emotion categories. A total of 4,799 participants from middle high, high school, and university age group were recruited in this study. Participants of all groups tend to report more positive emotions than the negative. Some specific negative emotions cannot be induced by music. The responses of middle high school students are different from that of the high school and university students, being weaker in amplitude, and less sensitive to darker emotions.

One of the most common and effective methods for this purpose is to use emotional film clips as stimulus materials. Many countries, such as the USA and Germany, have established databases of emotional film clips that are compatible with their cultures. The purpose of this study was to construct a database of Chinese emotional film clips that are compatible with the Taiwanese culture. To construct this database, which is designed to induce the emotions of neutrality, amusement, anger, sadness, contentment, fear, disgust, and surprise, 350 film clips were collected. After a preliminary screening, 120 film clips were included in a pilot study. Finally, 27 film clips were chosen for norm testing, and each clip was watched by at least 349 subjects. To rule out the effects of personal features, such as sex, whether the clip has been seen before, and the presence of other viewers, we added three psychological inventories to screen the subjects. The inventories included the Revised Rosenberg Self- Esteem Scale (Lin, 1990), the Chinese Hostility Inventory-Short Form (Weng et al., 2008), and the Type D Scale-14, Taiwanese-Revised Scale (DS14-TR) (Chung, 2011).

From Conditioning to Conditional Reasoning,Jong-Tsun Huang,"conditioning, cognitive psychology, conditional reasoning, associationism","The two most acclaimed notions of active processing and mental organization in cognitive psychology were forcefully advocated following the first introduction of Neisser's (1967) book to Taiwan in 1970. The introduction created confusion and contradictions in learning and research, especially when the then-prevailing studies on conditioning were based primarily in the context of associationism. The present study contrasts the two lines of studies, i.e., conditioning and conditional reasoning, to such an extent that they are obviously located at different levels along a continuum of cognitive hierarchy. However, based on new findings forty years later, a component of ”cognitive” causal reasoning can be found in a research paradigm of conditioning that was traditionally thought as ”associative” and ”passive”. The review echoes the historical perspective that the changes inevitably emerged from the established stream and the emerged changes will eventually converge and form a new stream. The observation seems to be applicable to the case of cognitive studies in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201309-201309270010-201309270010-245-253,55.3,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
From Mental Chronometry to Chronopsychophysiology: The Marriage of Mental Chronometry and Event-Related Potential,Shu-Lan Hsieh,"reaction time, stage processing, psychophysiological measure, event-related potential","The use of reaction time as a measure of psychological processes has enjoyed a long history in cognitive psychology and has been coined as ”mental chronometry.” However, because reaction time is measured as the time between the onset of an event (a stimulus) and the occurrence of a response, the total response time includes the time to sense the stimulus, the time to contract the muscles to make the response, and the time, which is of the main interest to cognitive psychologists, for all the non-motor processes in between. Given the possible contamination from motor stage processing times while inferring non-motor stage processing times by means of reaction time measures, another research approach, chronopsychophysiology, which measures the brain's psychophysiological (electrophysiological) responses to infer mental processes, has been borrowed from neuroscience and has become the more advantageous research approach in cognitive psychology since the late 20th century. There are several advantages to studying cognition by means of psychophysiological measures, particularly those of the event-related potentials, which can serve as markers for psychological processes (as ”windows” on cognition) as well as markers of physiological processes (as ”windows” on the brain). This paper aims to provide an overview of how and why such a research transformation occurred in cognitive psychology and to explore the benefits of a marriage between cognitive psychology and psychophysiology. In particular, this paper synthesizes various laboratories' studies conducted in Taiwan using electrophysiological data to infer mental processes. It is expected to document research approach developments in cognitive psychology, from behavioral to brain potential, in modern Taiwan.

From Semantic Processing and Representations to Semantic Development,"Tai-Li Chou, Li-Ying Fan, Shu-Hui Lee, Ciao-Han Wong","change, semantics, representations, processing, development","In the past 40 years, the research of cognitive psychology has been changing in both theory and technology to make this field more diverse and yet more integrative than before. This article provides a critical review on the changes of semantic processing and semantic representations with a focus on Chinese studies of Taiwanese researchers. The authors point out what potential limitations are in the literature and how subsequent changes come to answer critical questions. Two trends of changes on semantic processing and representations are observed, including a shift from adult participants to child participants and a shift from behavioral measures to neuroimaging measures. In the end, three suggestions are proposed for future directions: exploring topics of metaphor to understand semantics beyond the character/word level, recruiting neurologically impaired participants to examine the functional architecture of semantic representational systems, and using a longitudinal approach to evaluating developmental changes of semantic processing and representations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201309-201309270010-201309270010-277-288,55.3,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Beyond Phonology Matters in Character Recognition,"Jei-Tun Wu, Fu-Ling Yang, Wei-Chun Lin","neighborhood size effect, word recognition, radical processing, character recognition, frequency effect","The structure of Chinese characters is quite different from that of the alphabetic system. This rendered for decades whether phonology plays a role in character recognition. This article reviewed previous studies over the past forty years on issues related to character recognition, including the lateralization effect in reading, phonological recoding, sublexical processing, and frequency effect. We then argued that only researches concerning frequency effect are beneficial for advancing further studies. Based on previous explorations of word frequency, European researchers in alphabetic languages have recently started to elaborate on the possible role of other statistic properties of linguistics in word recognition. Compared with China, Hong Kong and Singapore, Taiwan is equipped with a longer research history and has cultivated the most diversified linguistic corpus systems for the research on traditional Chinese language processing. Based on computations from available data base systems, it is obvious that character frequency covariates with the number of different words embedding that character. A character with higher frequency tends to combine with other characters to constitute more multi-character words. Furthermore, previous studies on character recognition have pointed out that occurrence frequency is the most important factor, with an effect size even larger than that of word recognition from studies on alphabetic languages. Hence, the present study focused on whether the frequency effect of a character confounds with or consists of its combinability with other characters to constitute different words. If the combinability of a character affects the recognition of that character, then we can infer that a structure of network knowledge about the inter-connection between characters and words plays a role in the recognition of characters and words. From this angle, many previous studies concerning neighborhood effect or sub-lexical character processing in Chinese word recognition would need to be re-evaluated. Some preliminary results were also provided to elucidate the authors' proposition.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201309-201309270010-201309270010-289-318,55.3,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Roles of Representations in Selection,"Yei-Yu Yeh, Hsuan-Fu Chao, Yang-Ming Huang, Bo-Cheng Kuo, Cheng-Ta Yang, Chun-Yu Kuo, Szu-Hung Lin","emotion, memory, decision processes, selective attention","Attention research in Taiwan began with a study on attention breadth. As a growing number of cognitive psychologists contribute to the field over the past decades, the research topics have become diversified. Researchers in Taiwan have begun studying the mechanisms of selection in perception, memory, and decision processes. On the roles of representations in selection, we reviewed Taiwan's research in two domains: the influence of representation characteristics on selection, and the interaction between representations and top-down control. For the first domain, we reviewed three topics: the impact of emotional representation on selective attention, the influence of working memory representation on selective attention, and the effect of relative feature strength on the selection for perceptual decision. For the second domain, we reviewed three topics: the interaction between selective attention and visual working memory, representation competition and inhibition, and the locus of selective attention. Evidence from these studies showed that selection dynamically and flexibly operates according to the characteristics of stimulus representations that elicit bottom-up competition and behavior goals that activate top-down control under the constraint of resource limitation. Selection occurs continuously at multiple levels in multiple mechanisms. Thus, theoretical research should systematically investigate the contingency that selection operates in various contexts. Future research may integrate neuroscience methodology to investigate how selection operates as a function of individual differences, experimental contexts, and the task demand on cognitive processes. Future research may also uncover interlinks among selective attention, working memory, and consciousness.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201309-201309270010-201309270010-319-342,55.3,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Perspectives and Approaches for Psychological Researches of Embodied Cognition,Sau-Chin Chen,"situated cognition, cognitive science, embodied cognition, dependent embodied","Embodied cognition has been a potential approach in the cognitive psychology, whereas embodied cognition in cognitive psychology has developed later than the other fields in cognitive science in Taiwan. Psychological reviews in Chinese that analyze current perspectives on embodied cognition are necessary to evaluate its impact on the development of cognitive psychology in Taiwan. This article analyzed the criticisms of the six views of embodied cognition by Wilson (2002). She praised the view of body based information processing system in considering the evolution of human mind. The philosophical fundamental of information processing system without mental representations is revealed in the discussions of four non-Cartesian cognitive scientific frameworks: embodied, embedded, enacted, and extended, summarized by Rowlands (2010). Summing up both perspectives, an information processing system of embodied cognition is suggested to include the following - first, the structure of information-bearing objects which is compatible with the function of human sensory organs; and second, the available information which human sensory organs receive from information-bearing objects; and last, the action on information-bearing objects that augments or diminishes the information received. In consideration of the three characteristics, information availability would be the critical topic initiating the studies of embodied cognition in Taiwan. A review of the findings in recent studies, including fundamental research on infant cognition and cognitive evaluations of emotion, revealed the potential of Taiwan cognitive psychologists to conduct the advanced researches of embodied cognition. The situation of cognitive psychology in Taiwan will change when researchers are thinking implications of embodied cognition in their research topics and criticizing perspectives of embodied cognition theoretically.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201309-201309270010-201309270010-405-416,55.3,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The current study first asked whether the object effect obtained in the discrimination task was a result of within-object benefit or between-object cost. To answer this, Experiment 1 added an object-absent baseline to the cuing paradigm of Egly, Driver, and Rafal (1994). Perceptual load was manipulated, in which the low-load color and the high-load color/shape conjunction discrimination tasks were adopted. Results favored the within-object benefit hypothesis. The current study further asked whether this within-object benefit was a result of sensory enhancement or attentional prioritization. Experiment 2 adopted the data-limited accuracy measure in order to examine the strength of object representation.

Cognitive Shifting in 3-Year-Old Children: The Roles of Stimulus Familiarity and Labeling in a Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task,"Hsiao-Han Ma, Chi-Tai Huang, Li-Xin Yang","dimensional change card sorting task, cognitive shifting, perseverative behavior, latent representation, working memory","It has been well-documented that 3-year-olds perseverate by continuing to sort pictures on cards by using one rule when they are instructed to change the rule from one dimension to another. In this study, we delineated the influences of stimulus familiarity and labeling on children’s abilities to sort between dimensions. In Experiment 1, we tested a sample of Taiwanese children aged 2, 3, and 4 years by using a Chinese version of the dimensional change card sorting task (Zelazo, 2006). Similar to previous findings from Western countries, the results showed that only 4-year-olds switched to sorting by a new rule. In Experiment 2A, cards had unfamiliar shapes (inkblots) and were labeled with a generic term (”thing”) when stating the first rule. In Experiment 2B, cards were labeled with familiar names that children used to describe the cards themselves. In Experiment 2C, cards had familiar shapes but were labeled with a generic term on the first sorting dimension. The results showed that 3-year-olds were capable of extradimensional shifts only in Experiment 2A.

A Theoretical Model of the Causes of Juvenile Fire-setting,Jiun-Yih Huang,"trigger events, juvenile delinquent, fire-setting, juvenile","In this study, we constructed a theoretical model of the causes of juvenile fire-setting based on cognitive appraisal and the frequency and strength of trigger events. We suggested that juveniles choose fire-setting as means to commit crime because they view fire-setting positively. The development of a positive fire-setting appraisal is influenced by experiences of contact with fire and observational learning of fire-setting. In addition, the frequency and strength of trigger events moderate the association between appraising fire-setting positively and the practice of setting fires. The frequency and strength of trigger events influence whether juveniles who appraise fire-setting positively are likely to set fires. This study used an anonymous, self-reporting questionnaire to conduct a survey and collect data. Participants included 693 junior and senior high school students from the northern, middle, southern, and eastern Taiwan, and 688 delinquent juveniles from every reform school in Taiwan. In total 1,381 juveniles were involved in the study. The questionnaire included scales developed for this study measuring the positive appraisal of fire-setting, the experiences of contact with fire, observational learning of fire-setting, the frequency and strength of trigger events of fire-setting, and fire-setting behavior. The results showed that experiencing contact with fire and observational learning of fire-setting directly cause juveniles to appraise fire-setting positively, that the positive appraisal of fire-setting directly affects juvenile fire-setting, and that the frequency and strength of trigger events influence the association between the positive appraisal and the practice of juvenile fire-setting. The predictions of the theoretical model were supported. Finally, we addressed the implications of the theoretical model, the practical applications of the results, and the potentials for future study.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201306-201306260031-201306260031-217-236,55.2,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Predictability of Identity Importance and Identity Firmness to Depression: Developmental Changes across Adolescence,"Kun-Hu Chen, Keng-Ling Lay, En-Chang Wu","social identity, image identity, identity importance/firmness, adolescent depression, personal identity","Erik Erikson (1950) postulated that identity formation plays a critical role in adolescent psychopathology. This study examined how two features of self-identity - namely, identity firmness, referring to the sense of sameness and continuity of self-identity, and identity importance, referring to the personal needs for defining oneself - are associated with depression across three substages of adolescence. A total of 764 junior high school students, 805 senior high school students, and 274 college students filled out questionnaires on identity importance, identity firmness, and depression. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that all three aspects of identity firmness (i.e., the personal, social, and image identity) and the social and image aspects of identity importance corresponded to depressive symptoms in the junior high school sample. All three aspects of identity firmness, but only the social aspect of identity importance, corresponded to depression in the senior high school sample. Only the personal aspect of identity firmness predicted depression in the college sample. This study concluded that, during early and middle adolescence, identity importance significantly explained the variance of depression above and beyond the effect of identity firmness, which has been consistently revealed in prior studies as a robust predictor for adolescent adjustment. The developmental changes of the relation between different aspects of identity importance/firmness and depression across adolescence were also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201306-201306260031-201306260031-237-253,55.2,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Core Assumptions Scale (CAS): Psychometric Evaluation and Its Associations with Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms,"Yi-Jen Su, Sue-Huei Chen","shattered assumption theory, fundamental assumptions, posttraumatic stress disorder, scale, trauma-related cognitions","Janoff-Bulman's (1992) shattered assumptions theory proposes that people possess three kinds of fundamental assumptions, specifically that the world is benevolent, the world is meaningful, and the self is worthy. According to the theory severe trauma shatters and challenges these assumptions, resulting in posttraumatic adaptation difficulties. Janoff-Bulman's World Assumption Scale (WAS) is by far the most widely used measure for assessing these fundamental assumptions (Janoff-Bulman, 1989). However, its psychometric properties have been challenged by recent studies. Recently several measures assessing similar constructs have been developed, but their limitations also have been noted. Accordingly, based on the shattered assumptions theory and the literature on trauma-related cognition, the present study, using two sub-studies, aimed to develop a new, theory-reflective, and more applicable measure, the Core Assumptions Scale (CAS), to assess hypothesized fundamental assumptions. In Study 1, we developed the item pool of the CAS and administered it to 156 college students (69.9% female). Through item analysis and exploratory factor analysis, we arrived at our 15-item CAS, comprised of four subscales: safe world, just world, controllable world, and self-worth. In Study 2, a prospective study, the psychometric properties of the CAS were evaluated in 809 college students (60.2% female), who were followed up 2 months later. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the overall fit of our four-factor model was superior to that of other proposed factor-models, with related indices reaching acceptable levels. Therefore, we used this model for further psychometric examination. In these investigations the CAS showed good internal consistency and adequate 8 ~ 10 weeks test-retest reliability. Moderate inter-subscale correlations suggested that the fundamental assumptions assessed by the CAS were significantly associated with each other. Concurrent and predictive validity were adequate. The CAS total was able to significantly predict subsequent depressive severity, and its explained variance was superior to that of the WAS total. Significant differences were noted among different trauma groups on the CAS total and its subscale scores, with the assaultive violence group scoring the lowest. Moreover, the PTSD group scored lower on the CAS total and subscales than the no-PTSD trauma group and the no-trauma group. Taken together, these findings suggest that the CAS is a psychometrically sound measure of fundamental assumptions, making it suitable for investigating trauma survivors and people with PTSD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201306-201306260031-201306260031-255-275,55.2,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Evaluating Latent Interaction Effects by Model-Based Sattora-Bentler Scaled Chi-square Test and Path-Based Z-test,"Liang-Ting Tsai, Chih-Chien Yang","latent interaction, Z-test, latent variable, Satorra-Bentler test","The research is aimed to illustrate two statistical tests in evaluating latent interaction effects. The model-based Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square difference test and path-based Z-test are the two statistical tests. By modifying Wu and Cheng's two-stage model (2006), the one-stage structural equation model with various latent interaction effects was created and simulated. Various sample sizes, interaction effects, and regression coefficients were designed in the numerical simulations to evaluate the two statistical tests. The latent moderated structural equations with robust standard errors estimation were used in estimating the simulated datasets. The results showed that increasing sample sizes or increasing the absolute values of interaction effects helped the performance of both tests. Effects of sample sizes and magnitudes of interaction effect were shown to interact with each other. The paper concludes that the model-based Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square difference test should be used in testing latent interactions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201306-201306260031-201306260031-277-290,55.2,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Does Chinese Authoritarian Leadership Always Lead to Employee Negative Outcomes? Using Uncertainty Management Theory to Explore the Moderating Effect of Authoritarian Leadership on the Relationship between Distributive Injustice- Procedural Injustice Interaction and Employee Job Satisfaction,"Tsung-Yu Wu, Hong-Yi Liao","job satisfaction, authoritarian leadership, distributive injustice, procedural injustice","Authoritarian leadership is the characteristic leadership style in Chinese organization. Although past research has showed that authoritarian leadership leads to employee negative responses, some aspects of authoritarian leadership may also reduce employee uncertainty. Drawing on ”uncertainty management theory” and ”justice process-outcome interaction perspective,” we explored whether authoritarian leadership diminishes the interaction effect of procedural injustice and distributive injustice on employee job satisfaction. Using questionnaire survey, we collected data at two time-points and obtained 136 usable observations for hypothesis testing. The results of regression analyses showed that the interaction of procedural injustice and distributive injustice significantly related to employee job satisfaction only in the low authoritarian leadership condition (high uncertainty), whereas no such interaction effect was found in the high authoritarian leadership (low uncertainty). Employees reported a lowest level of job satisfaction in the low authoritarian leadership, high distributive injustice, and high procedural injustice condition. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of our findings as well as future research directions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201303-201303280010-201303280010-1-22,55.1,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Moreover, CSW can predict individuals' affective, cognitive, motivational, behavioral, and interpersonal variables. Although recent studies agreed that individuals contained multiple CSW in various domains, these studies assumed individuals' CSW on positive and negative events as the same psychological construct and tended to combine both types of scale items to create an one-dimensional index. However, the present study proposed that individuals' CSW on positive and negative events are two distinctive dimensions. After dividing CSW in achievement domain into two dimensions of success (positive) and failure (negative) CSW, SEM analysis from 440 undergraduates showed that the two-dimensional CSW model had better model fit than one-dimensional model.

A Two-Factor Model of Learning Motivation for Chinese Undergraduates: On the Function of Academic Identity and Role Identity,"Shun-Wen Chen, Chia-Ying Wei","learning motivation, role obligation, intrinsic motivation, Chinese achievement goals","According to the theoretical framework of Chinese goals of achievement (Chen, Wang, Wei, Fwu, & Hwang, 2009), the learning behaviors of Chinese students are motivated by both intrinsic interests in achieving academic goals and role obligations attached to social expectations. However, the hypothesis of social-psychological functions of students' role identity has not been examined by previous studies. In the present study, the authors propose a ”twofactor model” of learning motivations to elaborate on the relationships among Chinese students' academic identity, role identity, learning satisfaction, academic engagement, and performance. Scales were developed to measure students' learning experiences in real life. Participants include 176 undergraduates (101 females, 75 males) from two universities in Taiwan. The results of path model analysis showed that: (1) students' academic identity was positively correlated with their learning satisfaction; (2) students' role identity was positively correlated with their academic engagement; (3) students' academic engagement was positively correlated with their academic performance; and (4) students' learning satisfaction was the complete mediator of the relationship between their academic identity and academic engagement.

Assessing Memory Deficits Using Latent Class (Hierarchical) Multinomial Processing Tree Modeling: An Illustration Using Data from Clinical Groups in Taiwan,"Yung-Fong Hsu, Ling-Ming Tseng","multinomial processing tree model, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Markovian learning process, latent class analysis","The main symptom of dementia is the degradation of memory. In clinical settings the common approach to assess the functioning of memory is to take memory tests based on recall and recognition. However, such tests hardly reveal the underlying causes of memory degradation, because scores of these tests typically are not results of a single cognitive process but are influenced by several cognitive processes such as storage and retrieval. In this paper we introduce a cognitive modeling approach called ”multinomial processing tree models” to the clinical psychology community in Taiwan. This model assumes that the memory process consists of unstored, intermediate, and long-term states. The transition among the three states follows a discrete-state Markovian learning process, with the respective probabilities of storage and retrieval being characterized by some parameters. We illustrate the use of the model to clinical data collected from National Taiwan University Hospital, including Alzheimer's disease, early-onset dementia, senile dementia, mild cognitive impairment, vascular dementia, and organic brain syndrome. To assess the within-group heterogeneity commonly seen in clinical settings, we also incorporate a latent class analysis into the model. Parameter estimates via goodness-of-fit using the computer program HMMTree reveal that different types of dementia undergo somewhat differentiable deficits of storage and/or retrieval processes in the immediate and long-term states. We also discuss two limitations of the current study, namely the representativeness of the sample and the restriction of the HMMTree program.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201303-201303280010-201303280010-57-73,55.1,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Postural Response Time Varies with Temporal Predictability of External Disturbance,"Hui-Ya Chen, Shun-Hwa Wei, Wen-Hsu Sung, Wen-Wei Tsai","standing balance, perturbation, predictability, response time","Designing paradigms with predictable disturbances to balance allows for the study of anticipatory factors in the control of postural responses. To probe the effects of temporal predictability on postural response time in standing balance, this study identified a balance perturbation paradigm with a regularly spaced series of perturbations. A computer-controlled actuator applied horizontal hip displacements of 20 mm or 80 mm in twelve healthy young adults. In one condition, the timing interval between onsets of a series of hip displacements was set at 1,500 ms, and each perturbation was accompanied by a metronome beat 50 ms in advance. This was contrasted with conditions in which metronome beats every 1,500 ms were played but perturbations were introduced with random timing. In addition to the variable of timing certainty, another variable of direction certainty was factorially added-directed either alternately to the right and left or randomly. A three-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed that the temporally predictable perturbations resulted in a shorter response time -5.4 ms (p=.008), which may be magnified in patients with prolonged postural response times. Effects of disturbance amplitude (p=.086) or direction certainty (p=.997) or their interaction on response time were not observed. Possible mechanisms of the effect of temporal anticipation include heightened attention directed to a particular moment in time, or faster recognition of the balance stimulus parallel or prior to its actual sensory processing.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201303-201303280010-201303280010-107-117,55.1,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Tzeng","semantic, iconicity, gesture, Taiwan Sign Language, embodied cognition","We investigated the influences of embodied experiences and language-dependent knowledge on comprehending the iconic signs of Taiwan Sign Language (TSL), and the method of judging the possible meanings of iconic signs by naïve signers. In Experiment 1, we manipulated the degree of iconicity categorized by TSL experts and asked naïve signers to do a subjective iconicity rating task. The results showed similar judgments of iconicity degree between experts and naïve signers. In Experiment 2, iconicity was investigated by a 5-possible-meaning ranking task and a confidence rating task for each meaning. These results revealed that the meanings of the high iconic (HI) signs are easier to correctly determine, and the ranking performance of low iconic (LI) signs is influenced by the semantic categories. In Experiment 3, we accessed the representations of iconicity (manipulation-based/M, vision-based/V). While correctly ranking HI meaning, naïve signers can tolerate meanings from different semantic categories when viewing the M signs. In Experiment 4, naïve signers were asked to do picture gesturing of concrete nouns and the time from the onset of the picture to the release of the button was analyzed. The data suggested that manipulation-based and HI pictures are faster to gesture than others. Drawn from these observations, we demonstrated that the degree and the representations of iconicity in TSL can cross culture boundaries.

Examining the Effect of Perceptual Saliency on the Liking Judgment,"Cheng-Ta Yang, Ching-Chun Hsu, Yang-Ming Huang, Yi-Cheng Tsai","distinctiveness effect, mere exposure effect, recognition memory","Humans tend to be attracted by stimuli with more salient features, and hence tend to value them more highly. No prior research, however, has investigated the effects of perceptual salience on value judgments. In this study, we manipulated the perceptual salience of the study stimuli in order to verify the aforementioned tendency. Participants were asked to memorize a list of objects, a few of which were printed in distinctive colors. Afterwards, they were asked to recognize the test stimuli and make the preference judgment. The results showed that when there was sufficient time to encode the study stimuli and to retrieve details regarding the stimuli (Experiment 1 and 3A), the more salient test stimuli were valued more highly. In addition, the participants' memory performance and probability of recollection were higher. On the other hand, with insufficient time for encoding (Experiment 2) or retrieval (Experiment 3B), the participants did not show any preferences for the salient stimuli, and the distinctiveness effect on memory was not present. In addition, the participants indicated preference for a stimulus when they responded ”remember” as opposed to responding ”know.” They also preferred a stimulus when it had been subjectively perceived at the study phase. Taken together, these results are consistent with the uncertainty reduction hypothesis. Perceptual salience can enhance memory performance, reduce uncertainty in memory recognition, and therefore affect value judgments.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201303-201303280010-201303280010-139-158,55.1,2013,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The Nature and Predictors of Changes in Marital Satisfaction over the First 3 Years of Marriage,Ying-Ling Hsiao,"marital satisfaction, newlywed couples, growth curve modeling","This study estimated the trajectory of change in marital satisfaction for newlywed couples over the first 3 years of marriage. In addition, this study examined the longitudinal relationships among marital interaction (intimate interaction and negative behaviors), relationships with in-laws, and marital satisfaction, as well as spousal influences in such longitudinal relationships. A total of 128 newlywed couples from Taipei City provided 3 waves of data, which were analyzed by conducting growth curve modeling. Both the husbands and wives examined in this study began their trajectories of change at relatively high levels of marital satisfaction but showed a linear decline over time. The changes in newlywed marital satisfaction were mainly associated with the changes in intimate interaction and the relationships with in-laws rather than with the initial conditions of those factors. These results were consistent with the prediction of the reciprocal change hypothesis. Whereas the wives' negative behaviors were not associated with the initial state of the husbands' marital satisfaction, changes in wives' negative behaviors predicted those in husbands' marital satisfaction. However, although the husbands' negative behaviors affected the initial state of the wives' marital satisfaction, time varying negative behaviors of the husbands were not associated with the changes in wives' marital satisfaction. This showed that the partner effect of negative behaviors on the husbands' marital satisfaction was instantaneous, whereas that on the wives' marital satisfaction was long-term. The initial state and change in the couples' marital satisfaction were associated with the relationships between the wives and their in-laws, indicating that maintaining favorable relationships between the wives and their in-laws had a positive effect on the marital satisfaction of both the husbands and wives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201212-201301030021-201301030021-433-450,54.4,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Method: Using structured questionnaires, we collected data from a diverse sample of 598 full-time Taiwanese employees. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses showed that happiness had a positive effect on job performance, and perceived organizational support had also a positive effect on happiness.

Ninety one participants rated 300 pictures selected from the IAPS with 9-point scale of Self-Assessment Manikin in terms of pleasure, arousal, and dominance respectively. Thirty eight participants rated the 300 pictures twice in a two-week interval. Another 23 participants decided on the category of each picture according to its contents. Results showed that the IAPS had good internal consistency and acceptable test-retest reliability. A significant quadratic relationship between pleasure and arousal was obtained for these 300 pictures. Additionally, the eighteen different content categories obtained in this study closely represented the pleasure-arousal dimension affective space. Comparing with the IAPS standardized sample, the results of this study possessed both larger positive bias and negative bias and in-group advantage for some IAPS pictures with human faces, and there was a lack of pictures in any content category in the middle range of the affective space.

Induce Rules by Stimuli Presentation Sequences: Evidence from Switch Cost,"Wan-Ru Huang, Jing-Ling Li","rule induction, rule perceptibility, switch cost, presentation sequence","People tend to find correlations among different events and create specific rules to follow. Previous studies have shown that switching between different rules takes time; this is called the switch cost. Dreisbach, Goschke, and Haider (2007) introduced two stimuli at a time in each section and found that without debriefing the underlying rules of these stimuli, no switch cost could be observed. However, we argue that, with a proper sequence of adding stimuli to the experiment, participants should be able to generate rules by themselves. We hypothesize that successively presenting stimuli with the same rule (the induction group) could promote generation of the rule, as compared to mixed presentation of stimuli with different rules (the stimulus-response group). In Experiment 1, we asked participants to press keys following specific stimulus-response mappings without telling them the underlying rules, and found significant switch cost in the induction group but not in the stimulus-response group. Experiment 2 demonstrated that if the two underlying rules were highly perceptible, the stimulus-response group as well as the induction group could show significant switch cost. Experiments 3 and 4 revealed that when only one of the two underlying rules was perceptible, regardless of which rule was introduced first, only the induction group showed significant switch cost. Taken together, our findings suggest that rules can be induced via appropriate presentation sequence, except that the hidden rules are highly perceptible.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201212-201301030021-201301030021-511-525,54.4,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

ANS responses were measured through electrocardiogram, skin conductance, finger temperature, and facial electromyography. Following each film clip, participants were asked to self-report their subjective affect. The results of a one-way analysis of variance indicated that the ANS response change is significantly different among the various emotions. ANS-related variables were further analyzed by principal component analysis. Variables with higher weighting in each principal component were selected as emotional indicators.

Encoding Fluency and the Mere Exposure Effect,"Man-Ying Wang, Kuan-Wu Lee","repetition priming, mere exposure effect, negative priming, fluency","Mere repetition is sufficient to increase one's liking towards an object (Zajonc, 1968), yet it is not clear whether and how conditions accompanying item exposure or encoding may impact the mere exposure effect (MEE). Previous studies showed that attentional conditions in the encoding task can influence affective judgments (Griffiths & Mitchell, 2008; Raymond, Fenske, & Tavassoli, 2003; Yagi, Ikoma, & Kikuchi, 2009). This study examines whether the fluency of processing during encoding may mediate the mere exposure effect. Line-drawn, affectively neutral objects were presented in flanker displays that required naming responses in the study phase, followed by a test phase of liking judgments. Items that underwent ignored repetition in the study phase exhibited negative priming (NP) and thus disfluent processing, and they failed to produce reliable mere exposure effects in the test phase. Equivalent MEEs were found for items in the attended repetition and control conditions (Experiment 1). Altering the display layouts between the prime and the probe trials diminished the NP effect and recovered the MEE in the ignored repetition condition (Experiment 2). Experiment 3 manipulated contextual similarity in a within-subject design and the results replicated findings of previous experiments. These findings support that encoding fluency does affect the MEE and it is directly linked to liking, which impacts the resultant MEE.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201212-201301030021-201301030021-561-577,54.4,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

However, some recent studies indicated that authoritarian leadership, one of the key components of paternalistic leadership, is negatively related to employee effectiveness. These results challenge the integrity of paternalistic leadership theory. According to social exchange theory, this study suggested that the negative social exchange relationship between the supervisor and the subordinate can help explain the above issue and provides insight to paternalistic leadership theory. We proposed that subordinates' trust and distrust in their supervisors play key mediating roles in the relationship between paternalistic leadership and subordinates effectiveness. Using 268 supervisor-subordinate dyads sample from various Taiwanese companies, the analytic results indicated that: (1) Trust in supervisor and distrust in supervisor were different constructs; (2) Authoritarian leadership was positively associated with distrust in supervisor, and moral leadership was negatively related to distrust in supervisor; (3) Distrust in supervisor was negatively associated with loyalty to supervisor and job performance and positively related to deviance behavior toward supervisor; (4) Trust and distrust in supervisor fully mediated the relationship between paternalistic leadership and subordinate effectiveness.

The data were collected from 338 employees in the several industries, such as semiconductor, manufacture, and chemistry in Taiwan.As expected, a positive relationship was found between organizational frustration and workplace withdrawal. In addition, it was found that abusive supervision was positively related to organizational frustration. It shows that organizational frustration mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and workplace withdrawal. Moreover, organizational frustration was associated with individual difference in reaction to abusive supervision. In low levels of abusive supervision, workers with internal work locus of control reported a lower incidence of experienced frustration than those with external work locus of control. But, in high levels of abusive supervision, internals and externals reported higher levels of experienced frustration indifferently.

However, studies examining upward comparison effects found that students who compared themselves with academically advanced peers performed better in various academic domains, which suggests that students should attend prestigious schools. These conflicting results indicate that the impact of tracking on learning achievement remains unclear. Additionally, previous studies on both effects did not use appropriate variables to measure long-term academic achievement. This study employs two techniques based on the results of previous studies to increase current understanding of both effects: (1) Two indices for assessing longitudinal academic achievements, that is, students’ grade point average (GPA) and standardized college entrance examination, are used to investigate the BFLPE and the upward comparison effect. (2) Two methods of data analysis, that is, an overall-school analysis and an adjacent-school comparison, are used to identify differences in academic achievement among students with a similar ability comprising the lower end of a higher-track school and their counterparts from the higher end of a lower-track school. When GPA was the dependent variable, the results of the overall-school analysis and the adjacent-school comparison supported the BFLPE, but not the upward comparison effect. By contrast, when the standardized test score was the dependent variable, the results of the overall-school analysis and the adjacent-school comparison revealed an absence of both the BFLPE and the upward comparison effect. The results of this study suggest that studying at an elite school induces neither the BFLPE nor the upward comparison effect. Students of similar ability, who attended schools with different rankings, displayed no differences in their longitudinal academic achievement. Therefore, fighting to qualify for a higher-ranked school regardless of all other considerations is not required. The results of this study can be further explored in future Western studies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201209-201210020003-201210020003-315-330,54.3,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The formal participants included 257 betel nut chewers, recruited within one year and five months by human resource agency. Amongst them, the 128 participants recruited in the primary 6 months period were regarded as the preliminary sample. There were 39 items adopted, referencing 2 domestic studies on betel nut dependence and a widely-used smoking addicton scale (the Questionnaire on Smoking Urges-Brief, QSU-Brief); 37 items were selected for quantified analyses after expert validity analysis. Data from the preliminary sample were investigated with exploratory factor analysis by principal axis factoring extraction and direct oblimin rotation method. Based on the 3 item-deletion standards that we set up, we obtained 11 items and 3-factors structure in the scale: craving and desire (4 items), withdrawal response (4 items) and tasting habits (3 items). The eigenvalues of the 3 factors accounted for 63.10% of total variances, and α coefficients of reliability were between .73 ~ .89. Then, data from formal sample were modeled with 3 first-order factors and 1 second-order factor by confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation modeling. Most of model-fit indexes showed good fitting results, suggesting optimal construct validity of the scale. The scale also offered criterion-related validity for reference. Finally, we used ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve to explore possible cutoff scores. Based on the maximum information method of item response theory, we recommend the cut-off score of 24 to be the most stable approximation to determine potentials of betel nut dependence.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201209-201210020003-201210020003-331-348,54.3,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Relating Cognitive Competence and Diagnostic Severity to Adaptive Behavior Profiles in Preschool Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Ching-Lin Chu, Yi-Shan Huang, Chung-Hsin Chiang, Chin-Chin Wu, Yuh-Ming Hou","adaptive behavior, profile, autism spectrum disorders, symptom severity, developmental delay","Purposes: The present study examined the profile of adaptive functioning in preschool children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and its relationship to cognitive competence and severity of autistic symptoms. Methods: Adaptive behavior skills were assessed using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition (VABS-II). Participants were 81 ASD children with chronological age (CA) between 26 and 61 months. In the first analysis, 32 ASD children with CA between 42 and 52 months, 30 children with developmental delay (DD) (CA: 42-52 months), and 31 typical-developing children (TD) (CA: 27-49 months). They were closely matched for mental age, nonverbal mental age, and verbal mental age. The second analysis involved a total of 81 ASD children. They were divided into high functional autistic spectrum disorders (HFASD) and low functional autistic spectrum disorders (LFASD) by developmental quotient. Results: The VABS-II analysis revealed a 'motor ＞ communication = daily living skills ＞ socialization' profile as indexed by standard score and age equivalence. This was counter to the profile 'daily living skills ＞ communication ＞ socialization' presumed to be shown in autism. Overall, children with ASD lagged behind the two non-ASD groups. In the second analysis, partial correlation analysis controlling cognitive status showed that none of VABS-II domains were correlated to diagnostic features as reported by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) in either HFASD or LFASD. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that there is no 'autism-specific profile' in preschoolers with ASD.

Theory of Mind and Narrative Abilities in School-Aged Children with High-Functioning Autism,"Feng-Ming Tsao, Pei-Chun Tsai, Jia-En Wang, Hsin-Hui Lu","theory of mind, high-functioning autism, narrative, school-aged children","The Theory of Mind (ToM) deficit is well-documented in children with high-functioning autism (HFA). Few studies have explored the differences of ToM and narrative performances between children with HFA and typically developing children in the first and second grades. In addition, it is unclear whether ToM and narrative performances in children with HFA are related. To examine these questions, we administered a variety of ToM tasks as well as narrative tasks (with a series of comic strips) to 6- to 8-year-olds with HFA (n = 30) and typically developing children at the same ages (n = 30). Results show that the HFA and matched groups responded similarly to the difficulty rankings of the ToM tasks, with Diverse Desire (DD) being the most difficult, followed by Diverse Belief (DB), Knowledge Access (KA), False Belief-Unexpected Content (FB-UC), False Belief-Unexpected Location (FB-UL), Hidden Emotion (HE) and Secondary False Belief task (SFB). However, the matched group outperformed the HFA group on each ToM task. On narrative tasks, children with HFA performed similarly to the matched group in global narrative structure and specific linguistic features (e.g., total number of words and type-token ratio). However, compared with the matched group, HFA children used fewer psychological attributions, had lower ratio to correctly attribute character's intentions, and had more semantic intensifiers in their narratives. Finally, the ToM scores were significantly correlated with specific narrative features (i.e., ratio to correctly attribute character's intentions, usage of semantic intensifiers and number of ambiguous references). The stepwise regression model shows that ratio to correctly attribute character's intentions and usage of semantic intensifiers accounted for the most variances in HFA children's ToM performances.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201209-201210020003-201210020003-365-383,54.3,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Arrows in an Illustration When Reading Scientific Text: Evidence from Eye Movements and Reading Tests,"Yu-Cin Jian, Chao-Jung Wu","integration of illustration and text, scientific reading, eye movements, arrow","Previous researches have shown that the use of arrows can aid the comprehension of graphical information. From the functional perspective, arrows can provide useful information about sequential relations between graphical components and indicate pathway directions. However, the presence of excessive arrows in an illustration may produce negative effects related to perceptual complexity and division of attention. In this study we investigated the effect of using arrows in an illustration when reading scientific text by recording viewers' eye movements and obtaining their reading test scores. The participants first read a scientific text that included an illustration either with or without arrows (arrow group versus nonarrow group), and then they completed a reading test. The accuracy on the ”sequential items” and ”integrative items” was higher and the mean saccade length on an illustration was shorter for the arrow group than for the nonarrow group, but there were no differences between the groups in total fixation duration, fixation duration on an illustration, the ratio of the total fixation duration on an illustration, and the number of saccades between text and an illustration. Although the results of the reading test supported that arrows have a positive effect on the reading of illustrations, the results for eye movements were inconsistent. Alternative explanations are discussed based on comparing the types of materials and reading tests between our and previous studies. The indicators of eye movements that reflect possible processes involved when reading illustrations and text are also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201209-201210020003-201210020003-385-402,54.3,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The goal of this study was to explore whether the effect of gaze induced orienting varies with age. Three groups of typical developed participants were recruited: 9-10 year-old children, 13-16 year-old adolescents, and 19-25 year-old adults. Each group had thirty-three participants. The participants located a target while a schematic face was presented on the center of the screen. Half of the trials were valid in which the face gazed at the target, while the other half trials were invalid in which the face gazed away from the target. The gaze cue was presented 200, 1,200, or 2,400ms before the onset of the target. Results showed that, at 200ms SOA, all three groups responded faster to valid targets than invalid targets, while the cuing effect for children was larger than that for the other two groups. In addition, children showed significant inhibition of return at 1,200ms. Thus, our data suggested that children are more sensitive to gaze cues; this finding can be supported by neural development of gaze related brain areas at this age. Furthermore, adolescents showed similar results with adults, suggesting that their attentional mechanisms to gaze cues are relatively more adult-like.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201209-201210020003-201210020003-403-412,54.3,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Reassurance-Seeking: Interpersonal Model of Depression and Psychometric Validation of the Chinese Reassurance Seeking Scale in Taiwan,"Tien-Hao Huang, Sue-Huei Chen","depression, interpersonal theory, responses of others, reassurance-seeking","Coyne (1976b) proposed an interpersonal theory of depression to portrait the nature of the interaction between the depressed individual and her/his significant others. Such interaction will eventually produce an interpersonal space where depressed symptoms will elicit negative emotions and rejection from others. More importantly, it is assumed that these perceived rejections from others would in turn lead to the maintenance and/or deterioration of depressive symptoms in depressive individual. Joiner, Alfano, and Metalsky (1992) further postulated that reassurance-seeking serves as a core element in the interpersonal theory of depression. To demonstrate their theory, Joiner and his colleague have completed a series of research since 1992 on this topic and mainly found that reassurance-seeking not only serves to ”moderate” the effects of depression, but also plays as a ”vulnerability” role of depression. However, after a more thorough review of related literature, it is found that the item number and conception of the measure tool still need more clarifications and refinement. Therefore, two studies were conducted to examine: (1) the psychometric properties of the Chinese Reassurance-Seeking Scale (CRSS) including its factor structure, reliability and validity; (2) the contributory effects of reassurance-seeking on depression. Study 1 reported that the CRSS yielded satisfactory psychometric properties and demonstrated that reassurance-seeking is a reasonably cohesive, replicable, and valid construct. Study 2, by using a prospective research design in a group of initially symptom-free participants, showed that reassurance-seeking could predict future depression in response to stress and the predictive path was mediated by perceived negative responses from others. The finding is supportive to the vulnerability/contribution hypothesis of reassurance-seeking.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201206-201206290021-201206290021-133-148,54.2,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Associations among Interparental Conflict,Parenting Behavior, and Children's Adjustment",Li-Yu Shyu,"externalizing behavior, child adjustment, parenting behavior, interparental conflict, internalizing behavior","The relationship between interparental conflict, parenting behavior and children's adjustment were examined in a community sample of 539 fifth graders and 280 parents using a 2-wave research design. The parenting behaviors, including warmth, involvement, rejection, harsh discipline, father-child conflict, and mother-child conflict, were tested as potential mediators, moderators or independent predictors. The results indicated that negative parenting behaviors such as rejection, harsh discipline, father-child conflict, and mother-child conflict partially mediated the relationship between interparental conflict and children's internalizing problems. Furthermore, parental rejection, father-daughter conflict and mother-daughter conflict fully mediated the impact of interparental conflict on girls' externalizing problems. The parenting-as-mediator model was supported. In addition, both interparental conflict and parental rejection were associated with children's internalizing problems, and each predicted the internalizing problems independently. While, father-daughter conflict was related to girls' externalizing problems directly. Thus, the interparental conflict and parenting behavior as independent predictor model was also supported. These findings suggest the unique importance of interparental relationship and parenting behavior. For clinicians, interventions that teach parents to handle their marital conflict constructively and to parent their children positively in the context of marital conflict may be needed. Efforts to reduce interparental conflict and its spillover effects on compromised parenting are important for reducing children's adjustment problems.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201206-201206290021-201206290021-149-167,54.2,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The participants were asked to recall one anxiety-provoking social situation and one neutral situation. They were requested to form an imagery of the event and write a detailed description of it. They then rated memory vividness for each event. The results demonstrated that the high social anxiety group retrieved a higher proportion of self-related information than did the low social anxiety group when recalling an anxiety-provoking event.

The Development of the Chinese Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count Dictionary,"Chin-Lan Huang, Cindy K. Chung, Natalie Hui, Yi-Cheng Lin, Yi-Tai Seih, Ben C. P. Lam, Wei-Chuan Chen, Michael H. Bond, James W. Pennebaker","expressive writing, text analysis, LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count)","The analysis of natural language opens a window to the exploration of thoughts, feelings, and personalities. To analyze word use, Pennebaker and his colleagues (Pennebaker, 2011) developed a computer software, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). LIWC reports on the percentage of words in a text file that are in the grammatical, psychological, and content categories of its dictionary, and was created by judges who rated whether each entry belonged in a category. This paper describes the development of the Chinese LIWC dictionary and establishes its reliability and validity. Study 1 involved the translation of terms from the English LIWC dictionary to Chinese, and judges' ratings of whether each entry belonged in a category. Furthermore, some categories unique to the Chinese language were added to the Chinese LIWC dictionary. These resulted in a total of approximately 6,800 words across 30 linguistic categories and 42 psychological categories. In Study 2, we analyzed one hundred texts and their translations using both the English LIWC dictionary and Chinese LIWC dictionary. Fifty texts of varied genres and authors were written in English and translated to Chinese; others were written in Chinese and translated to English. Reliable correlations were found between the English LIWC and Chinese LIWC categories, indicating acceptable equivalence between the two dictionaries. In Study 3, we analyzed 30 bulletin board messages from a site for people suffering from depression, and 30 messages from a site on a control topic (personal experiences with part-time jobs). Similar to what past researchers have found in English, depressed people used more first person singular pronouns, fewer first person plural pronouns, and more negative emotion words than non-depressed people, confirming the validity of the Chinese LIWC. Just as the English LIWC has led to discoveries in the social sciences, the Chinese LIWC now opens new windows to the psychology of Chinese speakers and authors by providing an efficient means by which to analyze open-ended texts. Future research, applications, and revisions of the Chinese LIWC dictionary are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201206-201206290021-201206290021-185-201,54.2,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
An Introduction of Power Basis Theory: Definition of Power and Fungibility,I-Ching Lee,"power and needs, definition of power, fungibility, power and gender","The literature offers divergent definitions of power. Based on a power-as-need perspective, researchers observed various psychological and behavioral implications resulting from pursuing power. However, the power-asneed perspective has difficulty to account for why various types of power can be effective or to present fundamental principles in guiding the dynamics of power. I introduced a power basis theory (Pratto et al., 2010), in which we offered a definition of power and delineated three basic principles in power dynamics. Power is defined as the relative ability to meet one's needs in one's ecological field. The basis in which a person's particular need is evaluated is called power basis. According to power basis theory, because power corresponds to one's needs, one's sensitivity to a given need affects one's perceived power in the given power basis. Furthermore, different types of power can be effective in terms of how they fulfill or deprive of others' needs. Social perceptions of powerholders may differ on the levels of perceived trustworthiness in terms of how powerholders use power. Powerholders who use power to fulfill others' needs are perceived to be trustworthy, whereas those who use power to deprive of others' needs are perceived to be untrustworthy. Lastly, because human beings have different needs, a person's power can be fungible. When people have one particular type of power, they are more likely to have other types of power, resulting in actual power fungibility. When information is lacking, powerholders are more likely to be assumed having different types of power; such a phenomenon is called perceived power fungibility. Three studies were conducted to test whether (1) power corresponds to needs but pursuing power is not a need, (2) superiority in a given power basis is related to perceived power, and (3) when powerholders enjoy superiority in a given power basis, there is evidence for perceived power fungibility. Indeed, participants' selfratings data showed that the more a need is satisfied, the higher one's life satisfaction is (Study 1). Moreover, superiority in a given power basis increased perceived power, supporting the power definition offered by power basis theory (Study 2). When controlling for actual power, the more the powerholders were viewed with one type of power, the more they were viewed with other types of power, providing evidence for perceived power fungibility (Study 3). Evidence regarding power and gender was presented and further implications of power basis theory were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201206-201206290021-201206290021-203-217,54.2,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
A Journey to Icebreaking: Emotion Sharing and Its Effect on Superficial Harmony Friendship,"Hsiao-Ping Huang, Li-Li Huang","social sharing of emotion, friendship, superficial harmony, self-disclosure theory","Previous research on friendship mainly subscribed to the ”Social Penetration Theory” and considered that the interacting friends progressively disclosed themselves through daily interaction and developed intimacy gradually. Huang's theory (2006) suggests researchers should pay more attention to the superficial harmonious side of friendship. Friends who have superficial harmony may conceal their disagreements and not really like each other, even when they claim the other as ”a friend.” They also won't be willing to become close to each other. According to the self-disclosure theory, the superficial friendship seems to remain frozen in this state forever. But is it really true? This article including three studies tried to examine whether the automatic process of ”social sharing of emotion (Rimé, Mesquita, Philippot, & Boca, 1991)” may result in a change or a breakthrough in superficial harmony friendships and move toward genuine harmony.In Study 1, questionnaires were filled out by 383 Taiwanese college students. The results showed that the emotion sharing did happen in both superficial and genuine harmony friendships in Chinese society and different types of harmony displayed the same sharing patterns. All kinds of emotions were shared and affected the friendship quality after sharing. Study 2 focused on the emotion sharing types in superficial harmony friendships that were less frequent in Study 1 and used in-depth interviews as a method for qualitative study. The outcome proposed that emotion sharing in superficial friendships could break up the superficial relationship itself; and ”change in impression,” ”the same feeling” and ”feeling of secret sharing” could be the main influencing factors. In order to further examine the findings in the previous two studies, quasi-experimental methods were used in Study 3. The experimental stories included four manipulated emotions: sadness, happiness, guilt, affection, and one control condition of non-emotion sharing. The results indicated that friendship quality was affected by emotion sharing and the change was moderated by previous harmony type. Furthermore, in superficial friendships, the effect of negative emotion sharing on the friendship quality was mediated by ”feeling of secret sharing,” but positive emotion sharing was not the same. In conclusion, we discuss why the emotion sharing theory is better than the self-disclosure theory for the interpretation of a breakthrough in superficial harmony friendship moving into genuine harmony friendship.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201206-201206290021-201206290021-219-242,54.2,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The Effect of Perceptual Load on the Processing of a Distracting Schematic Face,"Yi-Cheng Tsai, Cheng-Ta Yang","perceptual load, attentional window, face perception, compatibility effect","Faces are special as they can be processed with higher priority compared to the non-face objects. Even when faces are presented as distractors, they are automatically processed to influence response selection. However, an earlier study (Bindemann, Burton, & Jenkins, 2005) showed that a distracting face was not processed to influence response selection when a face categorization task was performed. To solve this contradiction, this study investigated whether a salient distracting face is processed when participants were required to search for a face among five non-targets and judge its emotionality (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) or identity (Experiment 3). Response compatibility between target and distractor faces was manipulated to examine whether the distractor is processed. Results showed that when non-targets were five identical yellow circles (Experiments 1 and 2) and neutral faces (Experiments 1 and 3), the compatibility effect was observed (higher accuracy or faster response time in the compatible condition than in the incompatible condition); in contrast, when the non-target faces were upright (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) and inverted heterogeneous faces (Experiment 4), the compatibility effect was eliminated. These results suggested that perceptual load can modulate the processing of a distracting face. In a low-load condition, the distracting face is processed, while in a high-load condition the distracting face is not processed to influence response selection. The results are consistent with the proposals from both perceptual load theory and the attentional window perspective.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201206-201206290021-201206290021-253-267,54.2,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Experimental stimuli were character pairs that included semantically-related and semantically-unrelated pairs. In this study, DCM was used to examine the directional influences among brain regions, and hierarchical model comparisons were used to seek the optimal model with parsimonious connections in the semantic network. In conventional fMRI analysis, participants showed activations in left ventral inferior frontal gyrus (vIFG, BA 47), left dorsal inferior frontal gyrus (dIFG, BA 9), left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG, BA 21) and left fusiform gyrus (FG, BA 37). Based on a fully connected model among these four regions, we built sixteen types of models that differed in the modulation of the ”related” or ”unrelated” conditions on specific connections. From hierarchical model comparisons, the results of the optimal model showed significant modulatory effects from vIFG to pMTG, suggesting top-down influences of the frontal cortex on retrieval of semantic representations. Significant modulatory effects was also found from FG to pMTG, suggesting bottom-up influences of orthographic representations on semantic representations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201203-201203290014-201203290014-33-48,54.1,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Two Decades of Research on Task Switching: What More Can We Ask?,Shu-Lan Hsieh,"task switching, cognitive control, inhibition, interference, preparatory","A key aspect of higher cognitive control is the ability to switch efficiently between alternative tasks in a manner that is appropriate to the situation. For instance, a bilingual speaker needs to control which language she/he uses depending upon who is being spoken to and to switch between languages when necessary. Since in any given context there is a range of tasks that could be performed, the question arises of how we control our use of different tasks over time. Much of the research into dynamic cognitive control for the past two decades has employed the ”task switching” procedure which requires participants to respond to stimuli according to one of two alternative task-rules and switch the appropriate task-rule from trial to trial. Researchers have consistently found in such procedure that participants require more time in switching between two tasks than in merely repeating one task. In this article, I will review studies that have been conducted for the past two decades with various forms of task-switching paradigms and by use of behavioral and neuroimaging approaches. The review focuses on preparatory control mechanisms (switch-specific and/or generic) and theoretical accounts in task switching.

Alternatively, neonatal face preference can be explained by an innate non-specific top-heavy configuration bias on the basis that faces are inherently top-heavy. This review article aims to address the early specialization process for face and race in Taiwanese infants based our recent work. In the first two sections, we will review the classic findings on the neonatal face preference research. Three broad theories, the sensory hypothesis by linear system approach in the late 80s, the innate domain-specific representation hypothesis in the early 90s, and the non-specific top-heavy bias hypothesis in the last decade, will be addressed and compared. In the third section, we further explored some deeper issues regarding the top-heavy configuration bias hypothesis as well as our recent follow-up work. Using a forced-choice novelty preference method, we found that 2.5- to 4.5-month-old infants showed significant and equal novelty preferences, suggesting a reliable discriminability between the two configurations and a disappearance of the top-heavy bias. Moreover, using an eye-tracker, we investigated whether the top-heavy bias is still present in 3- to 5.5-month olds and in adults as a comparison group, and found no evidence for the top-heavy bias in both infants and adults. In the forth section, we illustrated the idea of an early specialization process for human face and race. Several recent developmental cognitive neuroscience studies on the infant brain as well as the behavioral studies on the other-race-effect in Caucasian and Taiwanese infants were reviewed. Taken together, our position on early face processing is in line with experience-expectant view; this view considers the brain specialization as emerging gradually from the interaction between small innate constraints and the critical input provided by the species-typical or race-typical environment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201203-201203290014-201203290014-97-116,54.1,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Such information signals the probability or likelihood of upcoming events, thus facilitating the visual system in preparing optimal responses in advance. This ability of the visual system to implicitly acquire predictive and probabilistic information has been well documented by behavioral evidence from many domains (e.g., spatial, temporal, and abstract probability). Recently, neurophysiological studies have begun to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying these learning processes and suggest a critical involvement of the fronto-parietal network and medial temporal lobe. In this paper we review evidence for such learning at the visual attention and oculomotor control levels. We also review some of the studies that delineate the neural substrates that contribute to probability learning at both levels: including the frontal eye field, supplementary eye field, posterior parietal cortex, and medial temporal lobe. Together, each of these regions provides a unique and critical contribution to probability learning in visual attention and oculomotor control.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201203-201203290014-201203290014-117-133,54.1,2012,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Chinese Perspective as a Rational System: Relationship to Panofsky's Symbolic Form,"Christopher W. Tyler, Chien-Chung Chen","convergence, scrolls, perspective, orthographic, illusion","The goal of this overview is to take a critical look at the use of geometric perspective in Chinese art through the millennia. Although its use is often considered to be disorganized and uniformed, Chinese perspective is seen to follow well-prescribed principles and to follow a rational solution to the problem of depicting perspective in the extended scroll formats adopted in this culture. Its dominating principle is that of oblique orthographic perspective (in which transversals are shown as horizontal and receding orthogonals conform to a uniform oblique). In a little-known relaxation of this scheme beginning in the 13th century, many Chinese paintings incorporate a notable degree of convergence among orthogonals within local regions of a scene, ameliorating the strong illusion of divergence that is perceived in the strict orthographic scheme. This subtle form of oblique convergence seems likely to have been developed to compensate for this divergence illusion. A corresponding compensation can also be found for the converse effect that can be noted in perspective illusions such as the Shepard illusion, which shows a paradoxical reduction in the perceived size of far elements such as table legs. The widespread employment of these stylistic choices in Chinese painting is evaluated in the framework of Panofsky's characterization of perspective as a symbolic rather than literal form of space representation and of its role in the culture of the imperial courts of the Chinese dynasties.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201112-201202220012-201202220012-7-27,53.4,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Fading, Perceptual Filling-in, and Motion-Induced Blindness: Phenomenology, Psychophysics, and Neurophysiology",Lothar Spillmann,"psychophysics, neurophysiology, perceptual filling-in, fading, motion-induced blindness","Why do we see what is not there? Fading of a target on a uniform background and perceptual filling-in from the edge are examples of the failure of the visual system to provide sustained vision under conditions of prolonged fixation. Another phenomenon that falls into this category is motion-induced blindness. The relationship between these three phenomena is not entirely clear, but the preference for small, peripheral, and low-contrast targets suggests that the mechanism underlying these effects may be similar. It has lately been shown that in addition to the above stimulus attributes, salience of the stimulus and perceptual grouping may also affect fading and filling-in. Furthermore, stereodepth and monocular depth cues have been proposed as relevant factors. These findings imply that in addition to bottom-up mechanisms top-down mechanisms are responsible for the perceptual disappearance of a fixated target by fading and filling-in. The following four articles in this special issue will summarize the phenomenological and psychophysical findings for fading and filling-in of brightness, color, and texture and correlate these observations with the presumed neurophysiological mechanisms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201112-201202220012-201202220012-29-33,53.4,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Fading, Filling-in, and the Perception of Uniform Surfaces",Lothar Spillmann,"texture, color, brightness, fading, filling-in","With a stabilized retinal image the percept rapidly disappears from view due to local adaptation, resulting in fading and filling-in (Gerrits, Stassen, & van Erning, 1984; Troxler, 1804). This observation demonstrates that in the absence of involuntary eye movements (drifts, saccades), we are functionally blind. The last twenty years have seen a surge of experiments designed to specify the conditions under which fading and filling-in occur. We know that with prolonged fixation targets assimilate into the background and become invisible, whether static, moving, or flickering (Spillmann, Neumeyer, & Hunzelmann, 1984). Such backgrounds need not be uniform and steady; a textured background or dynamic visual noise are as effective and can be even more so. Two hypotheses may account for fading and filling-in: (i) Generalization of brightness or texture across the enclosed surface region by edge-selective cells using form and color information; and (ii) active spreading of information from the edge by way of lateral propagation. There is evidence for both in cortical areas V1-V3. Two stages for fading and fillingin are distinguished: slow deterioration of the border and fast invasion of the enclosed surface from the surround. Current debate focuses on a comparison between filling-in of artificial scotomata (patches differing from the surround in brightness, color or texture) and real scotomata (blind spot, retinal lesions). We have found that filling-in requires little surround information. For example, a thin red ring hugging the boundary of the physiological blind spot will uniformly and completely fill-in the enclosed blind spot area. Similarly, a thin chromatic double contour will induce watercolor spreading over a wide area. These observations suggest cortical mechanisms involving long-range horizontal interactions to account for brightness and color perception on uniform areas.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201112-201202220012-201202220012-35-47,53.4,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Bridging Gaps at V1: Neural Responses for Filling-in and Completion at the Blind Spot,Hidehiko Komatsu,"monkey, blind spot, filling-in, primary visual cortex (V1), completion","No retinal input exists at the blind spot (BS). However, we do not perceive a hole in the visual field. Instead, within the BS, we perceive the same color, contour or texture as the stimuli surrounding the BS. This is called perceptual fillingin or completion at the BS. Filling-in and completion occurs not only at the BS but also in the retinal scotoma and in various phenomena in the normal visual field. This suggests that there are some mechanisms in our visual system that could interpolate incomplete retinal signals to form contiguous surface and contour. To elucidate the role of the primary visual cortex (V1) in perceptual filling-in and completion, we analyzed neural responses at the retinotopic representation of the BS in macaque V1. We addressed two questions: (1) Do V1 neurons respond to stimuli inducing filling-in or completion even though there is no direct retinal input to this region? (2) Do the responses of V1 neurons to such stimuli correlate with perception? We found that the answers to both of the above questions are 'yes.' Our results suggest that V1 plays an important role in the occurrence of filling-in and completion at the BS.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201112-201202220012-201202220012-49-56,53.4,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Perceptual Fading as Revealed by Perceptual Filling-in and Motion-Induced Blindness,Li-Chuan Hsu,"perceptual filling-in, boundary adaptation, depth ordering, motion-induced blindness","Perceptual-Filling-in (PFI) and Motion-Induced-Blindness (MIB) are two phenomena of perceptual rivalry in which a perceptually salient target, among a field of non-targets, disappear and reappear alternatively after prolonged viewing. Despite the apparent phenomenological differences between PFI and MIB, when we vary retinal eccentricity, stimulus contrast, perceptual grouping, and depth ordering, the results strongly suggest that both PFI and MIB are caused by a common mechanism. We argue that this mechanism involves boundary adaptation as a sufficient, but not a necessary condition. Given that PFI and MIB are more easily observed if the target is presented with uncrossed rather than crossed disparity, we tested further whether monocular depth cues such as interposition and watercolor illusion also affect the two phenomena, and whether the depth cues affect perceptual fading in static displays as well.

Brightness Induction: A Study of Correlates of Surface Brightness in Early Visual Areas,Peter De Weerd,"functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), surface brightness, early visual cortex","The neural mechanisms of surface perception are surprisingly poorly understood and ongoing research both in the domain of neurophysiology with animal models and fMRI in humans has led to conflicting results. In the domain of surface brightness perception, it is debated whether surface perception depends on the interpolation of brightness in early visual areas across regions in the visual field, where that information is physically absent. We used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in human subjects to test for a possible contribution of early visual areas to the perception of surface brightness. A brightness induction paradigm was employed in which counterphase illusory brightness changes on a grey surface are induced by dynamic luminance changes in the surround. We found fMRI activity in area V2 that may be attributable to the perceived brightness modulation of the constant, grey surface. This finding suggests a role of early visual cortex in the perception of surface brightness. The data are presented within the context of related neurophysiological studies in cat and monkey, as well as other human fMRI studies. Further experiments have to be performed to conclusively demonstrate a correlate of brightness interpolation during surface perception in humans.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201112-201202220012-201202220012-65-71,53.4,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Effects of Familiarity and Expression Variation on Face Recognition and Generalization,"Gary C. W. Shyi, Huei-Ming He","familiarity, generalization, image matching, expression variation, face recognition","Our ability in face recognition varies with familiarity of faces we encounter, and familiarity may affect both the representation and processing of faces. Here we proposed a model for classifying faces where familiarity varied along two continuous dimensions, frequency of contact and directness of contact, creating four possible types of familiarity. Hypotheses pertaining to recognizing faces of Types I (close friends), III (strangers), and IV (celebrity) familiarity were proposed and tested in Experiments 1A and 1B. Results showed effects of familiarity in that the higher the frequency of contact and the more direct the contact, the better face recognition (i.e., Type I ＞ Type IV ＞ Type III). Furthermore, recognition of Type-I faces was immune to variation in expression between the learned and test images, whereas recognition of Type-III faces was easily disrupted by change in expression. However, evidence for average face as the underlying representation for Type-IV faces was less clear than expected in that average faces derived from greater number of images failed to outperform those derived from fewer images. In Experiments 2 and 3, we explored the possibility of transforming familiarity type along the dimension of contact frequency by varying the numbers of exposure and expression of Type-III faces. Results showed that the original images were better recognized than those with altered expressions. Moreover, performance on faces with fewer exposures was impaired by variation in expression, especially when targets were old; however, with sufficient exposures, performance was enhanced by variation in expression when targets were new. We posited that variation in expression gives rise to generalization, whereas memory of the original image represents a consolidated trace of a specific expression leading to image matching. Taken together, the results lend support to the proposed familiarity model, which also provides a framework for examining factors that may help transform faces of one type of familiarity into another.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201112-201202220012-201202220012-73-106,53.4,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Jigsaw Groping of Person Perception: Its Conceptual Framework, Attention Bias, and Developmental Trend","Jenn-Wu Wang, Hung-Yu Lin, Feng-Ming Tsao, Wen-Ying Lin","developmental trend, person perception, interpersonal perception, conceptual framework, attention bias","Humans are by nature social creatures. In evolutionary terms, humans perceive others in ways that potentially facilitate social success. By combining various theories and findings, this article provides a rationale for a new conceptual framework of person perception, which predicts two basic dimensions-competence and morality-along a dimension plasticity concept. Based on this framework, human perception links discriminatory attention to others' competence, warmth, and the plasticity of these two features. On one hand, competence gradually accentuates with age. On the other hand, the accumulation of experience dictates how person perception varies across different social situations as well as differentiates into various person perceptions. Two studies were designed to test this jigsaw model of person perception. Participants in Study I were provided with behavior and trait information about a target person. A memory test was utilized as an attention index to determine whether differences of attention along the manipulated trait dimensions would be subsequently observed among second-graders (N=76), fifth-graders (N=84), high-school students (N=90), and college students (N=89), when participants recalled the information provided. Results supported the prediction that people mainly focus on competence and warmth dimensions, with the former surpassing the latter with age. The results also suggested that children might presuppose that competence and warmth remain unchanged during the early developmental stage. Study II utilized a Twenty Statement Test to explore whether people were attentive to different dimensions when they see their best friend, compared to when they encounter non-specific others. We asked the participants from second-grade (N=77), fifth-grade (N=69), high school (N=86), and college (N=85), to verbally describe their best friend (second-graders), or use twenty sentences to write down their impression of their best friend (elder groups). Results indicated that people focus their attention on their best friend in a different way than they do for general others.

Two kinds of form similarity were employed in the study: topological and geometrical properties. Using familiarization/novelty preference procedure, we tested 3- to 6-month-old infants with three kinds of pattern discrimination tasks in three blocks: horizontal and vertical stripes, patterns consist of topologically different elements (a disk and a ring), and patterns consist of geometrically different elements (a disk and a triangle). There were four trials in each block and each trial contained a 20-second familiarization period followed by a 20-second test period. The results showed that, for the stripe condition, 3- to 6-month-old infants significantly preferred the novel orientation, indicating a reliable discriminability between horizontal and vertical stripes. For the topologically different patterns, infants significantly preferred the pattern with a novel global orientation, indicating an ability to group the elements based on topological differences. However, for the geometrically different patterns, infants failed to show any reliable novelty preference, indicating an inability to group the elements based on geometric differences. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that 3- to 6-monthold infants can discriminate and group visual patterns based on topological difference.

The Impacts of Word Recognition Ability and Semantic Relation on Semantic Processing for Third Graders,"Ciao-Han Wong, Shiou-Yuan Chen, Tai-Li Chou, Shu-Hui Lee","word recognition ability, semantic relation, association strength, semantic processing","The ability to recognize words increases rapidly for third graders. This age group also starts to distinguish the functionally and categorically semantic relation of words. This study was aimed at determining whether word recognition ability would affect semantic processing and whether a shift of the semantic relation would occur for third graders. We used the child norms of association strength and selected stimuli from the norms to conduct two experiments. Participants were two groups of third graders with different word recognition abilities. In Experiment 1, participants performed semantic judgments on word pairs with either strong or weak association. Children with the better word recognition ability performed more accurately than those with the poorer recognition ability. Moreover, increased accuracy and faster reaction time were found for strong association pairs as compared to weak association pairs. In Experiment 2, participants performed semantic judgments on word pairs with either the functional or categorical relation. Children with the better word recognition ability performed more accurately and faster than those with the poorer recognition ability. Moreover, increased accuracy was found for word pairs with the functional relation as compared to those with the categorical relation. The findings suggest that word recognition abilities and semantic relation affect semantic processing for third graders. First, with more elaborate semantic representations, third graders with the better word recognition ability performed better semantic judgments than those with the poorer word recognition ability. Second, strong association pairs may correspond to closer conceptual links within semantic representations, resulting in increased accuracy as compared to weak association pairs. Third, the organization of semantic representation may be predominantly based on the functional rather than the categorical relation for third graders.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201109-201110080054-201110080054-293-307,53.3,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Spatial Terms and Spatial Cognition of Chinese-English Bilinguals: An Eye-Tracking Study,Hui-Li Lin,"spatial cognition, task complexities, spatial terms, eye movements, Chinese-English bilinguals","According to the strong version of language relativity theory, spatial terms should affect or constrain the performance of spatial recognition tasks when cued by different languages. However, a weaker version of linguistic relativism proposes a ”language as a category shaper” moderator point of view (Newcombe, 2005). To further explore this alternative viewpoint, the current study aims to investigate how categorizing boundaries in spatial terms between two languages may affect behaviors differentially as a function of task complexity. To achieve this goal, Chinese-English bilinguals' spatial cognition was assessed with eye-movement tracking techniques when they underwent visual recognition tasks cued with either Chinese or English spatial terms. The present study took on a 2 (cueing languages: Chinese vs. English) × 2 (task complexity: Less vs. More) complete between-subject experimental design. Seventy-three Chinese-English bilinguals were randomly assigned into 4 groups, ChLess, ChMore, EngLess and EngMore. Their eye moving patterns during visual encoding stage were observed and examined to see how they were affected by cueing languages under various degrees of task complexity. Eyetracking equipment was programmed to present task materials and record task performance, including eye-movement information. Total dwell time and total fixation count in specific areas of interest during the encoding phase were measured and compared among the 4 groups. We predicted that only when the visual information is complicated enough can the characteristic features of the cueing languages be shown. Our findings support this prediction, which is derived from the weaker version of language relativity theory. That is, our language does not change our cognition in a thoroughly one-way fashion. Instead, it moderates our thoughts as a category shaper.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201109-201110080054-201110080054-309-322,53.3,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Speech Timing Characteristics of Mandarin Sentence Production and Perception,Jing-Yi Jeng,"speech timing, pairwise variability index PVI, isochrony, rhythm, rime onset","The behavior of speech timing plays an important role in both speech production and perception. 'Isochrony' is the source speech rhythm, and there suggests a timing unit with equal duration in the speech stream. Based on the isochronous timing unit, the language users can produce sentences naturally and also implement speech segmentation for the perceived speech stream. The purpose of this study is to investigate the timing isochrony in Mandarin sentence production and perception. In the experiment 1, 21 mandarin speakers were instructed to read 42 sentences at five speaking rates. These sentences had similar syntactic structures in order to test the effects of neighboring syllables. Three units were proposed for speech timing: units with rime onset (rime + pause + C), units with gap onset (gap + CV), and units with consonant onset (CV + gap). Pairwise variability index (PVI) was compared for the three rhythmic unit. The results show that Rime onset unit had the significantly lowest PVI. Furthermore, it suggests that for maintaining the isochrony of rhythmic units in sentences, the durations of the rimes are influenced by the consonant in the following syllable across the syllables, and the gaps duration are also influenced by the vowel in the preceding syllable. In the experiment 2, the listeners were asked to judge the number of syllables in a spoken sentence with a segment replaced by white noise. The results showed that the listeners could successfully predict the number of syllables in the noise segment with 70% accuracy, even though four speaking rate variation. In the experiment 3, the participants were asked to imitate the sentences that had a segment replaced by noise, and some with prolonged vowels just before the noise segments. When given the sentences in written Chinese, most participants could successfully imitate the sentence with little timing difference from the original sentences, and they also could judge the prolongation of vowels with 73% accuracy. The results also show that the unit with rime onset had the smallest PVI values at most of the speaking rate situations. These results suggest that the basic unit of Mandarin speech timing is related with the vocalic onset, where is the boundary between an initial consonant and a rime of a syllable, or between a glide and a vocalic vowel in a syllable without an initial consonant.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201109-201110080054-201110080054-323-347,53.3,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The study designed a scenario about personnel promotion in the context of hospitals. Two chief residents were candidates for a visiting staff. While the excellent candidate was described as not having a relationship with the superintendent, either as his alumnus or as his close friend, the other was incompetent, and his relationship with the superintendent was manipulated, according to guanxi and category group, as the ”alumnus and non-friend,” ”non-alumnus and friend,” or ”non-alumnus and non-friend.” The decision to promote either the excellent or the incompetent candidate was manipulated. Totally, 173 students of medicine school were randomly assigned to one of the six conditions: 2 (excellent vs. incompetent) x 3 (”alumnus and non-friend,” ”non-alumnus and friend,” or ”non-alumnus and non-friend”). It was hypothesized that procedural justice (PJ) intensified the effect of distributive justice (DJ) on the impartiality evaluation. High/low PJ (impartial/partial decision) was predicted to enhance the positive/ negative effect of high/low DJ (promoting the competent/the incompetent candidate) on the impartiality evaluation. As predicted, the ”promote-competence and reject-guanxi” effect and the ”reject-competence and favor-guanxi” effect on the impartiality evaluation were found, but the ”promote-competence and reject-category” effect and the ”reject-competence and favor-category” effect were not confirmed. Furthermore, because of the unity of ”qing and li,” it was hypothesized that the ”favor-guanxi” (he qing) effect of the decision can moderate the negative effect of the ”reject-competence” (bu he li) on the renqing evaluation and that the ”reject-guanxi” (bu he qing) effect can decrease the positive effect of the ”promote-competence (he li).” As predicted, the ”reject-competence and favor-guanxi” effect on the renqing evaluation was found, but the hypothesized ”promote-competence and reject-guanxi” effect was absent. Category group effect on the renqing evaluation was not found, which implied that the concept of the ”renqing” was not suitable for the category group.

The present study used vocal and facial expression cues to investigate intentional ability in 16- to 20-monthold children. A pilot study looked at the Mandarin vocals that are synonymous with ”there” and ”woops” in English. In a semi-structured parent-and-child interaction context, 18- and 24-month-old children played with their parents. The parents' vocals in intentional and accidental conditions were recorded. Results showed that the intentional vocal ”Ah!” and accidental vocal ”Wa!” were most frequently used. In Study 1, we replicated the referential intent task (Chiang & Chang, 2008), corrected the vocal cues, and reduced the task difficulty. The examiner provided vocal and facial expression cues to indicate which container contained the toy. Results showed that 20-month-old children could differentiate between the demonstrated intentional and accidental cues. The 16-month-old children did not pass the task. The preference to choose the right or left side was not significant in either age group. Study 2 removed the lid of containers to reduce task difficulty, coding children's first response and last response. Similarly, 20-month-old children passed the referential intent task. Performance on the last response was better than performance on the first response, and these children needed longer time to process information. However, the children in Study 2 did not perform better than those in Study 1. This result explained that the lid of the container did not decrease the task demand. In conclusion, 20-month-old children can understand others' intentional cues of vocal and facial expression.

The results on group accuracy and response time revealed significant and robust main effects for symmetry, element connectedness, and probe quadrant, showing that the memory was more accurate and faster when the pattern was symmetrical, had a higher connectedness, and was more error-prone for probes located in the low-right quadrant. In Experiment 2, we tested the same effects with a change-detection task that encourages subjects not only memorize local parts but also the whole pattern. The results also showed significant main effects for symmetry, element connectedness, and the changing quadrant. As compared to Experiment 1, the symmetry advantage in the change-detection task was augmented while the effect of element connectedness was decreased.

The effects of emotion-related factors on impulse buying have not been extensively examined in previous studies, however. Current study presented and manipulated mood and affect forecast information of in an imagined shopping scenario (Rook & Fisher, 1995). The focus of interest was the manner in which these emotion information was processed in impulse buying as well as the potential roles of buying impulsiveness and the accompany of a friend during shopping. Results showed that mood and affect forecast information did not affect impulse buying performance in participants of low impulsiveness. Mood-threatening cues given under negative mood condition significantly reduced impulsive buying for medium- and high-impulsiveness participants. The increase in impulsive buying by mood-lifting cues under positive-mood condition failed to reach significance for these participants. The presence of a friend during shopping did not produce any significant effects on manipulation check and impulsive buying measure. These findings, as a whole, suggest that participants of high buying impulsiveness encoded mood and affect forecast information in a mood congruent manner to affect their subsequent purchase decisions. Implications of current study on the reduction of impulsive buying and limitations of the scenario method were also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201106-201106150076-201106150076-191-207,53.2,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Psychometric Properties of the Chinese Version of Revised Adult Attachment Scale and Its Prediction to Psychological Adjustment,"Yu-Lien Huang, Sue-Huei Chen","avoidance attachment, Taiwan version, anxiety attachment, revised adult attachment scale","The present study aimed to suitably refine the broadly used, dimension-based measurement of adult attachment in Taiwan, i.e., the revised adult attachment scale (RAAS). In order to examine the psychometric properties and applicability of its Chinese translated version (RAAS-C), two samples of college students were recruited. Sample 1 (n=177) was used to explore the potential factor structure via exploratory factor analyses. Sample 2 (n=240) was used to verify its factor structure via confirmatory factor analyses and to examine the reliability and validity of the scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that, consistent with the theory and existent adult attachment research, a two-factor structure, i.e., anxiety attachment and avoidance attachment, can better fit for the model of the RAAS-C. The RAAS-C displays good internal consistency and test-retest stability, with Cronbach's alpha coefficients .85, .79, and .84 as well as 2-week test-retest reliabilities .85, .79, and .85 for anxiety attachment, avoidance attachment, and total scale, respectively. It also demonstrates adequate construct validity with correlations to self-esteem, depression, and anxiety, and with anxiety attachment dimension predicting consequent depression and anxiety assessed over 2 weeks. Its criterion-related validity is supported by associations with the widely used relationship questionnaire (RQ), in that anxiety and avoidance attachment dimensions separately and adequately associated with two dimensions (i.e., model of self and other) and four categories (i.e., secure, fearful, anxious, and dismissive) of attachment on the RQ. Finally, the importance and applicability of adopting anxiety and avoidance attachment dimensions to explore emotional distress is discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201106-201106150076-201106150076-209-227,53.2,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Longitudinal Transmission and Longitudinal Effects of Conflict-Coping Strategies Styles on Taiwanese Married Couples' Marital,Yuh-Huey Jou,"marital interaction, latent class growth analysis, latent class transition analysis, conflict-coping strategies, marital quality, multivariate hierarchical linear model","This paper examined the longitudinal transmission of conflict-coping strategies styles among married couples, and their longitudinal effects on the relationship between marital interaction and martial quality. Two hundred and twenty six Taiwanese married couples filled out questionnaire once a year continuing for four years which included seven factors of conflict-coping strategies: reasoning, concealment and cold war, tolerance and acquiescence endurance, nagging, self-harm, others' intercession, and roundabout appeal; two aspects of interaction: negativity and received support; and two marital quality: satisfaction and regret. ANOVA, latent class transition analysis, latent class growth analysis and multivariate hierarchical linear models were applied. Results showed that the longitudinal styles of couples' conflict-coping strategies can be identified as ”always rarely use tactic,” ”always volatile diversely” and ”always indirect moderation.” The couples who were ”long-term indirect moderation” reported better interaction and higher marital quality, and the ”always volatile diversely” couples reported worse and lower marital quality continually. Both husbands and wives showed significant linear decrease in marital quality across time, and wives decreased more than husbands, but those decreases disappeared if considering negativity and received support. Those who reported lower conflict or received more support reported higher marital quality over time. The longitudinal effects of conflict and support on martial quality were varied by different conflict-coping strategies styles. Those lower negativity, higher support and ”always indirect moderation” couples reported best marital quality, however higher negativity, lower support and ”always volatile diversely” couples reported the worst quality over time. Finally, the limits and future suggestions were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201106-201106150076-201106150076-229-253,53.2,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Interaction of Low-Level Computation and High-Level Modulation in Human Stereopsis,"Jong-Tsun Huang, Da-Lun Tang, Jy-Chyi Yuan, Shwu-Lih Huang, Shojiro Sakurai","computational vision theory, inverse optics, high-level modulation, monocular and binocular cues, stereopsis","The present article reviews a set of studies that were conducted in the period of 1983-2000 for a test of the evolving computational vision theory after the posthumous publication of Marr's (1982) classic on vision. Two pillars of the main architecture, namely, the spatial correspondence assumption and the fundamental assumption of stereopsis, with their realization into a successful implementation of cooperative algorithm were briefly described and put into a series of critical tests. A summary evaluation was suggested to highlight the plausibility and inadequacies concerning an application of retinal matching constraints (especially, the constraint of compatibility) in human stereoscopic processing. An alternative approach based on the operation of conjunctive and vergent eye movements in finding hidden disparities has been simulated to show its successful resolution of visual recovery, and henceforth, inverse optics. Further experimental evidence were provided to show the operational precedence of disparity and contour information with a compromise to the modulation of high-level factors in human stereoscopic processing. High-level influence could be brought into effect to resist the stereo capture to a positive disparity plane where residing the illusory contour while a Chinese character was resting on a zero-disparity background. A similar result was also observed in a stereoscopic experiment on bistable figure. Monocular cues were shown to be effectively modulating the disparity computation. The study also maintains that a cognitive interpretation can not be excluded in the discussion of disparity interpolation in the blind-spot area. The study therefore proposes that an evolving computational vision theory should better take feedback mechanism into account to deal with the intricate interaction of low-level computation and high-level modulation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201103-201103280009-201103280009-1-20,53.1,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Perception of Object Reachability and Postural Control in Sighted and Blind People,"Chia-Chun Huang, Chih-Mei Yang","ecological psychology, affordance, blind, body sway, perception-action","Individuals can judge the reachability of object by hearing without vision. Body sway modulation is to pick up available information while facing various task demands or different environments. The primary perceptual system and experiences of blind people are different from those of sighted people. The purposes of this study were to investigate the difference in perception of reachability for sighted and blind people, and to observe their body sway so as to examine postural control while perceiving affordances. Twenty sighted and 8 totally blind people served as participants. The sighted group visually and audibly judged whether the object in front of them was reachable, and rated the confidence of their judgment. The blind group judged the reachability audibly only. Body sway measures were recorded when participants perceived the target. Based on the results, the conclusions are as follows: (1) Regarding sighted and blind people’s auditory judgment of reachability, the two groups exhibited equal accuracy and body-scaled ratio, but higher body sway was found in blind people; (2) Comparing between non-judgment and judgment trials, the body sway of sighted people reduced in visual and auditory judgment, but the body sway of blind people increased in auditory judgment; (3) Visual and auditory judgments of sighted people showed equal accuracy in perception of maximum reachable distance, but higher body-scaled ratio and lower body sway for visual judgment were found. Therefore, consistent with perception-action coupling in ecological psychology, both blind and sighted people's actions would change in order to perceive affordance. Sighted and blind people with different experiences in visual and auditory perception have developed dissimilar patterns of postural control to perceive the fitting affordance perception.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201103-201103280009-201103280009-21-34,53.1,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Exploring the Other-Race Effect in Taiwanese Infants and Adults,"Hsin-Yueh Hsu, Hui-Lin Chien","infant vision, visual paired-comparison task, other-race effect, perceptual narrowing, face recognition","The other-race effect (ORE) refers to the phenomenon that we can discriminate own-race faces better than other-race faces. The present study aims to explore the face processing ability for own-race and other-race faces in Taiwanese infants aged between 4 and 9 months when the visual system is still maturing. The stimuli contained faces of three ethnic groups (Asian, Caucasian, and African). In each race, the face discrimination task had three levels of difficulty (Easy, Median, and Hard). The visual paired-comparison (VPC) task was used to assess 4-, 6-, and 9-month-old infants' discriminability for the familiar/novel faces via recording infant's looking time. Comparable 3-alternative forced-choice procedure was used in the adult experiment except that an additional ”identical” condition was added. The results showed that 4-month olds can only discriminate Asian ”easy” faces. 6-month olds can discriminate ”easy” faces of all three ethnic groups. 9-month olds can further discriminate ”median” Asian and Caucasian faces but not African ”median” faces. For adults, the accuracy decreased and response time increased as the stimulus difficulty increased, indicating the validity of the stimulus difficulty. In conclusion, own-race advantage emerges around 4 months of age, while ORE may take place between 6 and 9 months as the discriminability for African faces does not improve. Taken together, these findings suggest a mixture of general improvement in face processing ability as well as a specific tuning by the own-race experience.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201103-201103280009-201103280009-35-57,53.1,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The Students' Role Obligation and Their Perceptions of Legitimacy of Being Rewarded or Punished in Confucian Society,"Tsai-Szu Yen, Kwang-Kuo Hwang","punishment, effort, moral domain, reward, academic domain","The educational psychologists in the west have done researches to indicate an asymmetry of using rewards and punishments by teachers in moral and academic domain in the elementary and junior high schools. Teachers administer more punishments to students violating moral rules, while administering more rewards than punishments for performance in the academic domain. This research was aimed at studying the legitimacy of teachers' use of rewards and punishments, as perceived by students, in moral and academic domains in Taiwan. In this study, scenario questions were used to survey 119 junior high school students in Taipei, and found that the pattern of using rewards and punishments in the moral domain is similar to that of the West. That is, students who practice positive duties do not need to be rewarded, while those who violate negative duties should be punished. The patterns of using rewards and punishments in academic domains of the West are quite different from those of Confucian society. Participants in this research thought that teachers should give more punishments to those effortless students, than those putting forth great effort, but with low academic achievement. They also thought teachers should apply more blame than recording a demerit. When students performed well in academic domains, only those students who made efforts should be rewarded, and teachers should give more rewards to such effortful students than effortless students. The above results can be inferred from students' and teachers' role-obligations in Confucian society. Learning hard is a student's obligation, and guiding students to obtain higher academic achievements is a teacher's duty. The arguments in this research can be generalized to the patterns of the use of punishments in educational situations in Confucian society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201103-201103280009-201103280009-79-95,53.1,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Employment Interview Structure: A Field Study of Perceived Procedural Justice and Applicant Reactions,"Chien-Chih Kuo, Shi-Nian Chang","job-relatedness, perceived procedural justice, interview structure, standardization","The past decade has been continued interest in the employment interview, with organization-oriented or applicant-oriented perspectives in research emphasis, but few field studies have been conducted in Chinese enterprise to examine the effects of employment interview structure on applicant reactions. Thus, this research approached this issue by using organizational justice theory and examined the applicant reactions (organizational attraction, intention to accept the job, self-efficacy, self-perceived performance) to interview structure (job-relatedness, standardization) and explored the base for these reactions in terms of the perceived procedural justice. The data were collected from 152 applicants in the several industries, such as Semiconductor, Manufacture, and Chemistry in Taiwan.
Three major findings manifest in the results. First, interview structure had a significant predictability for perceived procedural justice. Compare to job relatedness, the effects of standardization on perceived procedural justice were larger. It suggests that standardization has more influence on the applicants' perception of procedural justice than the influence of job-relatedness. Secondly, perceived procedural justice also had significant predictability for the applicants' post-interview reactions, such as organizational attraction, intention to accept the job, self-efficacy, and self-perceived performance under the condition of controlling the applicants' demographic variables and pre-interview perception to organization, intention to accept the job, and self-efficacy. It shows that applicants rely on the interview structure to gather information and make evaluations about the recruiting firms and jobs. Therefore, in order to enhance the applicants' positive perception and reactions in organizational settings, the practitioners ought to provide as much information as possible about the employment interview during the selection processes. Thirdly, we found that interview structure affects applicants' post-interview reactions through its impact on perceived procedural justice. In particular, contrary to job-relatedness, standardization had a positive effect on perceived procedural justice, in turn, perceived procedural justice affect the reactions of applicants positively. In summary, perceived procedural justice mediates the relationship between standardization and applicant reactions. The results offered general support for the applicability of the organizational justice theory to the employment interview. Further discussion focuses on theoretical and practical implications of the observed outcomes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201103-201103280009-201103280009-97-114,53.1,2011,Chinese Journal of Psychology

A total of 128 newlywed couples from Taipei city area provided 3 waves of data. Hierarchical linear modeling confirmed a linear decline in the newlywed's marital satisfaction. When couples' marital satisfaction and educational level were controlled, results revealed no systematic changes in the husband's depression and yet appeared a quadratic change in the wife's depression. The results also indicated that the mean marital satisfaction (or depression) of husbands and wives were associated with their own depression (or marital satisfaction). The bidirectional association between trajectories of changes in marital satisfaction and depression was confirmed for both couples. Gender differences were significant. The time-invariant relations between marital satisfaction and depression were stronger for wives than for husbands. However, the magnitudes of effects in time-varying relations were different due to the direction of prediction. Time-varying depression affected wives’ marital satisfaction more than husbands'; time-varying marital satisfaction affected husbands' depression more than wives'. Significant partner effects revealed that time-varying depression of the spouse affected wife's marital satisfaction and this partner effect was weakened when the wife was college educated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201012-201012290030-201012290030-377-396,52.4,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Children were assigned to either Secure or Insecure Group according to their behaviors described by the Attachment Q-Set (AQS). These mother-child dyads also participated in a 15-minute laboratory free-play session. Maternal behaviors during play were described by QMP-Version 2.0, which includes seven dimensions of (1) Creativity, (2) Praises & Affections, (3) Teaching & Directives, (4) Sensitivity, (5) Appreciation, (6) Responsiveness, and (7) Physical Interruption. Each mother's QMP description was correlated with the criterion sort of the play behaviors of ”hypothetically most secure child’s mother.” Results revealed that mothers of the Secure Group exhibited more physical interruption, F(1, 28)=4.96, p＜.05, employed less teaching and directives, F(1, 28) =3.97, p＜.06, and were marginally more sensitive, F(1, 28)=3.60, p＜.07, than did mothers of the Insecure Group. Study 2 explored whether mothers from Taipei and New York were different in their tendency to display the ”opportunity-education” (Fung, 1999) and ”self-esteem promotion” (Mintz, 1999) play construct that represents the Chinese and Western child-rearing value respectively. Participants included the 30 dyads in Study 1 (Taipei) and 16 dyads (preschoolers' mean age=4 year 5 month) from Long Island, New York. The precedure of the laboratory free-play session was the same as in Study 1 just that the maternal play behaviors were described by QMP-Version 1.0.

Production of Symbolic Play in Children with Autism: A Case of Triune Representation,"Chung-Hsin Chiang, Hsing-Fang Lu, Ching-Lin Chu","triune representation, social looking, autism, symbolic play","Background: There is considerable empirical evidence for deficits in pretend play in children with autism compared with children with developmental delay (DD) and typically development (TD). We referred Tomasello and his colleagues's suggestion (Tomasello, Striano, & Rochat, 1999) and used the ”triune representation” point of view to measure the child's symbolic play behaviors.
Objectives: The purpose of this study was to (1) examine the production of symbolic acts in structural play condtion; (2) explore the patterns of social looking of symbolic acts in functional and symbolic play conditions. Methods: Based on the perspective of ”triune representation,” a modified paradigm from Striano, Tomasello, and Rochat (2001) was tested to 17 children with autism (mean chronological age [CA]=69 months, mean mental age [MA]=56 months), 17 MA-matched children with DD and 19 children with TD. Two experiments were arranged. In experiment 1, examiner (E) introduced the doll house divided into four rooms with appropriate prop sets and used the three pairs of actors, including replica dolls (a toy man and toy woman), instrumental objects (a pencil and a scissors), and natural objects (a rock and a stick) to play. Experiment 1 consisted two phases: baseline and testing phases. In baseline phase, examiner introduced the doll house and encouraged the child to use each of the three actors set in turn. Each pair can play in the doll house for two minutes. In testing phase, examiner modeled with the action prompt or verbal direction first and then encouraged the child to play each pairs of actors for two minutes. We measured child's symbolic acts spontaneously in the Action and Language conditions. In experiment 2, children were given the ”functional sets” (i.e., doll + bed and pegboard + hammer) and ”symbolic sets” (i.e., doll + block and pegboard + brush) randomly to play in front of examiner. We counted the child's looking behaviors during/after he/she engage in the functional and symbolic acts with object.
Results: (1) In experimental 1, there was a significant difference of symbolic acts among the three groups in the baseline phase and the children with autism displayed fewer than those children with two control groups. After examiner's modeling, children with autism imitated less symbolic acts and displayed lower novel symbolic acts comparing with the two controls. (2) In experimental 2, children in the three groups revealed no significant difference on the frequencies of looks to examiner during/after performing functional acts. However, the children with autism displayed less looks to examiner than children with DD and TD after they displayed symbolic acts.
Conclusions: Using the perspective of ”triune representation” to measure the spontaneous symbolic play acts, children with autism not only showed impairments on symbolic production but also displayed fewer social looking for social communication. The theoretical and clinical implications were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201012-201012290030-201012290030-425-443,52.4,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology

After one night of deprived sleep, habitual chewers and non-chewers chewed either betel nut or gum before proceeding to the UFOV subtests. In the UFOV subtests, participants needed to identify the central target, divide their attention to the peripheral target, and detect the peripheral target embedded in the distractors while identifying the central target. We report that betel nut chewing could broaden the UFOV size for the habitual chewers, but not for the non-chewers.

However, its emphasis on the psychological study of specific cultures seems to be incompatible with the goal of pursing universal laws of main-stream psychology. In this article, we present three empirical studies about infant-child sleep arrangement: a cross-cultural study between Taiwan and France, and two Taiwan emic studies. The prevalent co-sleep pattern in Taiwan and the prevalent sleep-alone pattern in France clearly reflect the difference of self-other boundary between relationalism and individualism cultures. Based on the results of these three studies, we also clarify the meaning of one-mind many mentalities. In this article it is shown in the divergent development of self-other boundary and self-construal based on the same universal process of attachment-separation-individualization for adapting to norms of different cultures in which a child grows up. All infants in this world are on the same process of attachment-separation-individualization, but in the Western world, the socialization of children emphasizes the aspect of separation and the development of independent self, whereas, in Chinese society, the emphasis of relationalism blurs the parent-child boundary and the development of interdependent self.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201009-201009270044-201009270044-221-241,52.3,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Examining the Specific Implicit Theory of Personality-Behavior Association: The Comparisons of Different Personalities, Gender, and Status",Kung-Yu Hsu,"Chinese personality, interpersonal interaction, gender, implicit theory, status","This study explored the content of six kinds of specific implicit theory of personality-behavior association (competent, impotent, extraverted, introverted, other-oriented, and self-centered) based on different gender and status and the impact of these implicit theories on participants' interpersonal behaviors in the working situation. Hsu (2003) presented a new theoretical construct that coined as the implicit theory of personality-behavior association and examined the relationship between this implicit theory and interpersonal interaction. The implicit theory of personality-behavior association refers to the associative schema about target with one kind of personality will perform some kinds of interpersonal behavior. Hsu (2003) considered these implicit theories could be influenced by those interacting situations and the interacting targets' characteristics (like gender and status) and these implicit theories could influence on interpersonal interaction behaviors. We would test this possibility.
The study has collected 434 adult participants (236 female) to fill out two kinds of structural questionnaires that were designed two different cooperative scenarios of working tasks. These scenarios were designed according to four combinations of gender and status of interacting dyads and sex personalities of interacting targets. Results showed that, all six kinds of specific implicit theories of personality-behavior associations were supported by participants' responses. The impact of the gender and status of interacting targets on specific implicit theories of personality-behavior only was found in the competent target. And the impact of all of specific implicit theories of personality-behavior on participants' interacting behaviors supported the theoretical predictions. These results were discussed in terms of dyadic interaction in working situations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201009-201009270044-201009270044-243-264,52.3,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Duality of Hope: The Development and Validation of a New Scale,"Yueh-Chuan Luo, Li-Li Huang, Yi-Cheng Lin, Kwang-Kuo Hwang","effort, agency thinking, hope, cultural comparison, defensive pessimism","The Hope Theory (Snyder, 1994, 2000) emphasizes that the imagination of future success inspires individuals to go forwards. Hope includes two factors, agency thinking and pathway thinking, and can be termed as ”enhanced hope.” However, Chinese culture values the strengths of flexibility and calmness derived from the persistence in face of failure and suffering. This culture-specific consideration is proposed and termed as ”peaceful hope.” It includes transcendental adaptation and persisting effort. In this article, duality of hope and four factors, namely agency thinking, pathway thinking, transcendental adaptation, and persisting effort, were constructed to develop a new scale. Then, two empirical studies were conducted to test their validity.
In study 1, a survey was conducted and Taiwanese college students (N=267) were asked to complete a questionnaire that included the scales for four hope factors and other criteria variables, such as optimism, self efficacy, internal control, defensive pessimism, and social desirability. The results showed that participants had high tendency to the four hope factors. Through models competing, a higher-order model with two hopes (enhanced hope, peaceful hope) combing four factors (agency thinking, pathway thinking, transcendental adaptation, and persisting effort) and fitting indicators was undisputed and accepted. In addition, the new Hope Scale exhibited good convergent and discriminate validities.
In study 2, in order to test the increase validity of the new Hope Scale, another survey using the questionnaire was conducted. Data was collected from 665 Taiwan college students. In the questionnaire, besides the scale for four hope factors, scales for measuring life satisfaction, positive affection, hopelessness, and depression were also included. The results indicated that two peaceful hope factors (transcendental adaptation and persisting effort) explain additional variance over and above the contribution of the original enhanced Hope Scale in predicting both positive and negative adaptation. The enhanced hope predicted more positive adaptation (life satisfaction), while peaceful hope showed stronger negative correlation with negative adaptation (hopelessness). That is to say, peaceful hope led to less hopelessness. Finally, we discuss cultural aspects of hope research as the eastern peaceful hope component advances and complement the western hope theory.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201009-201009270044-201009270044-265-285,52.3,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Relationship between Social Cognition Evaluations and Crime Experiences: A Comparative Study on Different Types of Offending Behavior,Chien-An Chen,"socio-cognitive evaluation, crime types, crime specialism index CSI, moral domain assignment","The reason why some offenders only engage in specific pattern of offences but not others remains incompletely answered. There is a lack of social-cognitive perspective theory designated to explain crime choice. The different cognitive beliefs about offending exhibited by offenders were tapped within a multi-manners research framework. Offenders were asked to cross-assess or compare their own and three other crime types (drug abuse, theft, sexual, and violent) in terms of the crime self-identity, normative beliefs, cognitive beliefs, crime episode judgment, and moral domain assignment. The question addressed in this paper concerns the extent to which beliefs and social knowledge about offending characterize the four different characteristic types of offending. Two hundred and ninety adult male prisoners (mean age=34.0 years) provided self-reported criminal histories. From these a crime specialism index (CSI) indicative of the proportion of offences of each type was calculated for each offender.
Results showed all cognitive variables were entered as predictors, but the number of the variables included in crime regression models varied from one to another. Drug offence CSI was amongst the best crime type to be predicted by the social cognition variables investigated. This may be explained by the fact that drug CSI accounted for 42% of total averaged CSI. The more intensive an offender's involvement in a specific pattern of crime the more likely were they to evaluate this type of crime more positively, legitimately and less moral concerns involved than any of the other crime types concerned. In this way, cognitive representations reinforce an offender's specific pattern of criminal acts while also may insulate them from pressures towards other criminal activities. Evidence is presented that offenders' social knowledge development is consolidated around crime themes corresponding to the predominant crime engaged. It is thus suggested that offenders may socio-cognitively adhere to specific patterns of criminal thinking. To maximize their benefits and maintain the cognitive equilibrium, a self-serving (denying crime consequences and legitimating their own offending) but other-negating thinking inclination emerged in offenders' social knowledge. Therefore, the habitual offending behavior may be the function of reciprocity between crime cognitions and repeated crime engagements. Future research should explore in greater depth the specificity and versatility of social cognitive reasoning in this context. Also, more offenders' idiographic viewpoint regarding the factors which intervene between beliefs about what is good and good behavior need to be understood better.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201009-201009270044-201009270044-287-308,52.3,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Implementation and Application of Bayesian Three-Level IRT Random Intercept Latent Regression Model,"Hung-Yu Huang, Su-Pin Hung","latent regression, multilevel model, item response theory, Rasch model, Bayesian inference","Multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) has received much attention developing into many different models. Traditionally, the standard IRT or MIRT models have two-level structure. Three-level IRT latent regression models were proposed with a MML algorithm, the predictors in IRT latent regression, however, have been assumed to be error-free. Recently, research has explored the application of a Bayesian IRT approach. This study aims to explore the Bayesian three-level IRT random intercept latent regression model (Bayesian 3L-IRT-RILRM) and assess the accuracy of its parameter recovery and efficiency. All of simulations were based on the one-parameter logistic model under the 3L-IRT-RILRM. Three tests with 20 items in each test were analyzed and 40 clusters, each containing 50 examinees, were simulated. The generated data sets were fitted to the four different models: the proposed model, the two-level latent regression model, the conventional MIRT model, and the conventional unidimensional IRT models respectively. The computer program WinBUGS with Metropolis-Hastings sampling was implemented to estimate model parameters. The Bayesian model-data fit checking techniques, such as posterior predictive model checking (PPMC), pseudo Bayes factor (PsBF) and Bayesian DIC, were implemented to choose which model was better. The results of PPMC produce an analytic index which can identify the 3L-IRT-RILRM as the best model. Furthermore the proposed model was considered best to describe the generated data through model comparison. The model parameter estimates were recovered fairly well in the framework of the Bayesian approach if the generated data was fitted to the proposed model. If the random intercept in latent regression was ignored, the parameter estimates would be biased and the precision of estimation, as well as the test reliability would be overestimated. Finally, two empirical data sets from the TEPS and BCTEST were used to illustrate the use of 3L-IRT-RILRM as the analytic model for comparison with other competitive models. 3L-IRT-RILRM is reliable and provides the most complete description of real data. Further studies and recommendations are addressed by the authors for extending more general models.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201009-201009270044-201009270044-309-326,52.3,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Effects of Semantic Radical and Semantic Association on Semantic Processing of Chinese Characters for Adults and Fifth Graders,"Kuo-Chung Hung, Shu-Hui Lee, Shiou-Yuan Chen, Tai-Li Chou","phonology, orthography, semantic association, semantic radical","While past research has investigated the effects of semantic radical or semantic association on comprehension of meaning for children, little is known about the impact of semantic radical integrated with semantic association. This study addressed this issue using a semantic relatedness judgment task with semantic association strength (strong, weak) and semantic radical (with, without) varied between character pairs. Participants were asked to decide if two Chinese characters were semantically related, when the first character was visually presented and the second character was auditorily presented. Experiment 1 recruited two groups of participants (adults and fifth graders) that differed in ages and word recognition abilities for the semantic judgment task. Our results showed a reduced difference between adults and fifth graders in reaction time on semantic judgment of strongly related radical-shared pairs as compared with that for without-radical pairs. Experiment 2 recruited two groups of fifth graders with various word recognition abilities to perform the semantic judgment task. Our results demonstrated better discrimination sensitivity on judging strongly related radical-shared pairs as compared with that for pairs without shared radicals. The semantic radical was found to affect meaning judgments for fifth graders. There are two implications in this study. First, compared with adults, fifth graders may not have elaborate semantic representations available and thus may not use the whole character to get the correct answer among homophones. They may need the aids of orthographic similarity from the shared radical between characters on meaning judgments of strongly related pairs. Second, when fifth graders process strongly related pairs that have greater overlapping features between characters, orthographic similarity aids in the detection and integration of these features.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201009-201009270044-201009270044-327-344,52.3,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Constructing a Theoretical Framework for the Ontogenetic Development of the Chinese Bicultural Self: A Preliminary Statement,"Kuo-Shu Yang, Yih-Lan Liu, Shu-Hui Chang, Lin Wang","four-part theory of Chinese self, individual-oriented self development, Y-model of bicultural-self development, social-oriented self development, traditional-modern bicultural self","Cultural ecological research has demonstrated that different ecological environments tend to create different forms of subsistence economy, which in turn make various types of society and culture possible. Thus, agrarian economy facilitates the formation of agricultural society and collectivistic-oriented culture, whereas industrial economy eases the development of industrialized society and individualistic-oriented culture. In order to help the members in these two contrasting types of society and culture to acquire the motives, thoughts, aptitudes, values, temperaments, and behaviors necessary for effectively functioning in their respective subsistence economies, distinctive patterns of socialization practices have to be designed and promoted. The causal sequence as postulated in the above is as follows: Ecological environments→subsistence economies→societies and cultures→socialization practices→psychological and behavioral characteristics.
During the long process of societal modernization in Chinese societies (especially Taiwan and Hong Kong) in the last hundred years or so, both traditional agrarian and modern industrial economies have been coexisting for so long a time that a bicultural society has been gradually formed in each of them. In such a society, the collectivistic-oriented and individualistic-oriented cultural elements or aspects are mixed, or even integrated, in daily activities and practices. The traditional-modern bicultural society tends to actualize a bicultural kind of socialization practice, which in turn leads to a bicultural pattern of psychological and behavioral characteristics.
In a bicultural society like Taiwan or Hong Kong, people need a bicultural self to integrate their bicultural psychological and behavioral characteristics. Yang (2004) and Lu and Yang (2006) called such a kind of self the traditional-modern bicultural self. Yang proposed that the Chinese bicultural self consists of both the traditional, socialoriented self and the modern, individual-oriented one in accordance with his four-part theory of the Chinese self. The former is further divided into three subselves, respectively labeled as the relationship-, the familistic (group)-, and the other-oriented self.
In this paper, a Y-shaped model of the developmental stages for the Chinese bicultural self is proposed. First of all, we slightly modify Jane Loevinger's (1976, 1983) six-stage model of ego development to form a five-stage one for the ontogenetic development of the individual-oriented self: (1) Preconformity Stage, (2) Conformity Stage, (3) Individualistically Conscientious Stage, (4) Autonomous Stage, and (5) Individualistically Integrated Stage. In contrast to this model, a five-stage one for the development of the social-oriented self is constructed to include the following corresponding stages: (1) Preconformity Stage, (2) Conformity Stage, (3) Collectivistically Conscientious Stage, (4) Homonomous Stage, and (5) Collectivistically Integrated Stage. The earliest two stages are identical in the two five-stage models, whereas the later three in one model are diametrically different, in one way or another, from the corresponding ones in the other. It is thus possible to place the early two stages on the stem of the Y-form layout. Beyond the intersection point, the later three successive stages for the social-oriented self are placed on the left arm, and the corresponding three for the individual-oriented self on the right one. A Y-shaped developmental model for the Chinese bicultural self is thus conceptually proposed. The defining psychological (cognitive, motivational, affectional, and intentional) and behavioral characteristics of such a self are described for each stage on the stem and the two arms, so that the empirical test of this Y-form developmental model of the Chinese self could be made feasible.
Finally, some preliminary recommendations for empirically testing the Y-model of bicultural-self development are made. It is suggested that the whole age range for the participants to be used should be from 3 to 70 years old, and this range may be divided into three age groups: (1) kindergarten children and 1-4 grade pupils, (2) 5-6 grade pupils and junior and senior high school students, and (3) college students and ordinary adults. The validity of the Y-model will be tested by using participants from the three age groups in three consecutive years in Taiwan and Mainland China.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201006-201006300006-201006300006-113-132,52.2,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Quality of Subjective Experience in Daily Lives of College Students: The Effect of Perceived Challenges and Skills,Wen-Chih Tseng,"the quality of experience, flow, perceived challenge, perceived skill, college students","This study conducted two major examinations. First, the present study examined whether varying ratios of perceived challenge and skill can explain the range of negative to positive variations in daily experience. Second, the article investigated the effects that perceived challenges and skills in activities have on the quality of everyday life experience. The design of the study involved an experience sampling methodology; 101 college students completed experience surveys at eight times during the day for a period of one week, resulting in a total 5,640 observations. The experience surveys measure daily variations in five dimensions of experience (concentration, control, interest, enjoyment, and involvement) in four contexts. Findings showed that the quality of experience in high-challenge/high-skill conditions was characterized by high concentration, control, interest, and involvement of the situation. Results from hierarchical linear modeling analyses showed that prediction of flow theory that the interaction of challenges and skills has a positive effect on the quality of experience. Yet some differences of parameter estimates were found between dimensions of experience and between social contexts of activity. The perceived challenges, skills, and their interaction explained 11%-39% of the with-individual variance in dimensions of experience. These findings suggest implications for improving the quality of Taiwanese college students’ life and call for a further improvement of the flow model.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201006-201006300006-201006300006-133-153,52.2,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Why Did They Make More Efforts?-Examining the Explanation of Academic Motivation and Resilience,Chong-Shiann Hsu,"interest, academic resilience, goal setting, competence belief, academic effort","This study examined the prediction of competence beliefs, academic interest, career goal setting, and academic resilience on academic efforts in terms of social cognitive theory and self-determination theory. Out-of-school time for academic activities was used as the indicator of academic efforts. The 2005 freshman samples from the Taiwan Higher Education Data System were used, and only those from departments of mathematics, science, engineering, medicine, and science education in technology universities were analyzed. The participants were 10,749 freshmen. Student’s t-test showed that the freshmen from national universities performed significantly greater academic efforts, competence beliefs, interest, and career goal setting than those from private universities. Cross-sample structural equation modeling showed that the prediction of academic interest, goal setting, and academic resiliency on academic efforts was significant among the samples from national universities as the same as among those from private universities. Competence beliefs predicted academic efforts indirectly through interest, goal, and resiliency. The prediction of competence beliefs on interest, college life plan, and academic resiliency was greater in the samples from private universities than in those from national universities. Freshmen who spent 4 hours or above in previewing, reviewing, and homework everyday were defined effortful, and those who did not spend any time were defined effortless. For private university freshmen, logit regression analysis showed that effortful ones performed greater academic interest, goal setting, and academic resiliency significantly than effortless ones, and that academic resilience was the most explanatory. In conclusion, compared with private college freshmen, national college ones made more efforts because of their greater academic interest and goal setting. Compared with their effortless colleagues, effortful freshmen from private universities spent more time in learning because of greater academic resiliency. The integration of motivation theories was discussed. Implications for counseling practices and further research were suggested.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201006-201006300006-201006300006-155-171,52.2,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Cognitive Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia on Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review,Wei-Chun Lin,"cognitive-behavioral therapy, cancer, insomnia","Sleep disturbance in cancer is a significant problem that interferes quality of life, however, this issue has been neglected until recent two decades.

The purposes of this review article are to evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I for cancer patients, and to identify the barriers and the strategies of CBT-I implications on oncology departments.
The results showed that CBT-I was effective in cancer-related insomnia, without altering the main treatment components, especially the stimulus control and the sleep restriction. Additional muscle relaxation training helped to improve sleep onset latency, fatigue management positively affected patients' fatigue and sleep quality, and the cognition reconstruction had benefits to the depressive mood. Those who had limited mobile ability, such as hospitalizing or bedridden, would be impeded to adhere all components of CBT-I. Therefore, some modifications to fit the restrictions of cancer patients would be necessary.

Testing the Applicability of a Multiplicative Hyperbolic Model of Inter-Temporal and Risky Choice in Human Volunteers,"Chun-Han Liang, Meng-Yang Ho, Yong-Yi Yang, Ching-Tsorng Tsai","probabilistic discounting, delay discounting, impulsivity, risk taking, inter-temporal choice","Background: Impulsive choice can be defined as the selection of small immediate rewards rather than larger delayed rewards, or a predisposition to risk taking. A multiplicative hyperbolic model (Ho, Mobini, Chiang, Bradshaw, & Szabadi, 1999) proposes a quantitative methodology for analyzing inter-temporal choice has proved successful in describing impulsive and risky choice in rats. The present study aims to test the applicability of the model to data from human participants.
Methods: Forty healthy volunteers underwent two experimental tasks of choosing between two alternatives (A and B) for monetary rewards. Each task consisted of several conditions based on the same design. On one task, alternative A produced a probabilistic reward after a short delay (d(subscript A)), and B a certain reward after longer delays, d(subscript B). d(subscript A) was manipulated across 5 conditions. There were 50 trials (10×5 trial type) in each condition. Indifference delays, d(subscript B(50)) (value of d(subscript B) yielding 50% choice of B) were estimated for each participant in each condition. On the other task, a similar procedure was employed, except that reward sizes for A and B were different, but with the same probabilities. Linear functions of d(subscript B(50)) versus d(subscript A) were fitted; the slopes and intercepts provided indices of sensitivity to reinforcement size, delay and probability.
Results: d(subscript B(50)) increased linearly with d(subscript A) (r^2 ＞.99) in the two tasks. There was a significant correlation (r=.60, p ＜.001) between the intercepts (sensitivity to delay) but not between the slopes (sensitivity to size and probability) in the two tasks (r=.18, p =.269). Conclusion: These results show the indifference equations specified by the multiplicative model to account for effects of reward size, delay and probability on choice appear to be applicable to data from humans.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201006-201006300006-201006300006-189-204,52.2,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Analyzing Complete Approval Voting Data under Thurstonian Framework,"Rung-Ching Tsai, Ringo Moon-Ho Ho","approval voting, random utility model","The method of approval voting is a commonly used voting procedure. In an approval voting task, each judge is usually asked to select a subset of the alternatives. For example, it is a common practice that the recruiting committee, after interviewing a set of job applicants, may apply approval voting to determine the qualification of the candidates at the first run of the hiring process. In analyzing social choices such as elections, the ”none” and ”all” responses are often discarded since they do not affect on the overall decision or conclusion. However, in understanding and modeling the approval voting mechanism or heuristics, it becomes preferable to include these two responses in the analysis as well. In this paper, we extend the current random utility approach to allow for the modeling of ”none” and ”all” responses and therefore provide a more complete account of the approval voting mechanism in the underlying choice process as well as the individual difference in their judgment. Empirical examples are given to illustrate the usefulness of our approval voting model formulation.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201006-201006300006-201006300006-205-219,52.2,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology

But some existed issues still need to be refined further. The one of most important is the multiple levels of analysis of PL: The group difference approach which considers the leader would treat all employees equally and the individual difference approach which considers the leader would treat employees differently. Therefore, based on past research, this study continues to explore the effects of PL on the employee effectiveness both operating at individual or dyadic level (or micro-level), organizational level (or macro-level), and the interaction effect. The data is formed of participants of 70 businesses with 382 employees, who have close job-interaction with CEO, and collected by survey. The results proved again the influences of PL at individual level and showed the influences of PL at group level which emphasized the importance of Moral Leadership. Besides, the result showed the moderator influence of average PL on the relationship between the individual PL and employee effectiveness which then verified PL was not pure individual level or group level but the individual within the group level. The consequences were conformed to the construct of interdependence in Chinese society. The effect of leadership on employees is not only from the individual leadership but also from the moderated effect of average leadership, which highlights the interdependent relationship among individual, group, and leader.

Beck proposed that when encountering stressful events, the people with dysfunctional attitudes may develop cognitive triad, and then become depressed. However, earlier empirical research on Beck's theory has been limited and generated inconsistent findings. Therefore, this study formulated an interactional model based on Beck's theory. The model was tested by structural equation modeling technique. Participants were 162 patients with major depressive disorder recruited from south and north Taiwan. Participants completed the List of Threatening Experiences, the Short-version of the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, the Cognitive Triad Inventory and the Chinese version of the Beck Depression Inventory. Statistical analyses indicated that the effect of the interaction between negative life events and dysfunctional attitudes on depressed symptoms in the interactional model was not significant. This indicated that Beck's theory was not supported. However, the path coefficients among the other variables in the model were still significant. After model modification, this study again formulated a mediational model. Statistical analyses indicated that all path coefficients in the mediational model were significant. The model revealed that negative life events affected dysfunctional attitudes, which in turn influenced the cognitive triad, which in turn led to depressive symptoms.

Social Attention in Young Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"Chin-Chin Wu, Chung-Hsin Chiang, Yen-Ting Yu","language ability, social orienting, young children with autism spectrum disorders, joint attention","Background and purpose of the study: While social stimuli (e. g., facial expression, name calling, and speech, etc.) are complex and unpredictable, they are important in early social development when children engage in social interaction. Failure to attend to social stimuli would impair the development of social communication. It has been shown that children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) around the age of four has displayed social attention impairment in social orienting and joint attention (e. g., Dawson et al., 1998, 2004; Leekam et al., 2006). However, the nature of social attention and the relationships among social orienting, joint attention and language development in young children with ASD under the age of three have not been explored yet. The purpose of this study was to investigate social attention and its relation to language in young children with ASD under 36 months.
Methods: The participants were 20 30-month-old children with ASD, 20 28-month-old children with developmental delay (DD), and 20 typical developing 17-month-old infants (TD). The ASD and DD groups from a local hospital in southern Taiwan were assessed and diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000) and ADOS (Lord et al., 1999) by a research team, consisting of two child psychologists and two child psychiatrists. Materials used in the study were modified from Dawson et al. (1998, 2004), including 6 social stimuli and 6 nonsocial stimuli presented randomly through one of two speakers posited in front of child’s left and right sides. Social stimuli involved calling the child’s name with three different emotional tones and three different two-word vocabularies as well as nonsocial stimuli consisted of hammer and electronic music, each with three different rhythms. The joint attention was measured using Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS, Mundy et al., 2003) to explore relationships among social orienting, joint attention, and language competency. Results: The results showed that social orienting and overall orienting were poorer in the ASD group than in the DD and TD groups. It was also found that children with ASD were poorer in joint attention tasks than the DD and TD groups. Additionally, joint attention was a better variable than social orienting to discriminate ASD group from non-ASD groups. Moreover, correlation analyses revealed a significant relationship between overall attention orienting and high level response to joint attention in the ASD group that was critical to language development. For both control groups, no significant relationship was found among social orienting, response to joint attention and initiation of joint attention.
Conclusions: The results suggested that social attention impairments in young children with ASD are shown under age of three, and the response to joint attention is more important than initiation of joint attention to language development in children with ASD under 36 months. Further studies are needed to follow the subjects to clarify the developmental trajectory of early social development in children with ASD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-201003-201004060003-201004060003-57-74,52.1,2010,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Convergence of Non-Parametric Adaptive Threshold Estimation in the Yes-No Task,"Yen-Ho Chen, Yung-Fong Hsu","transformed up-down, non-parametric adaptive methods, biased coin design, threshold estimation, stochastic approximation","In psychophysical research of detection and discrimination, non-parametric adaptive methods, including the fixed and non-fixed step-size methods, have been used extensively for threshold estimation through a combination of decreasing and increasing stimulus steps (see Leek, 2001; Treutwein, 1995, for reviews). In recent years, researchers have focused on the asymptotic and small-sample properties of some of the methods via computer simulations (e. g., Faes et al., 2007; Garcia-Perez, 1998, 2001). In this article we systematically investigate via simulations the large-and small-sample properties of some of the non-parametric adaptive methods in the yes-no detection task. The convergence for different starting values, relative step sizes, and response criteria is systematically investigated. The results show that in both the large- and small-sample conditions, the accelerated stochastic approximation (ASA) (Kesten, 1958) performs well with medium to large (initial) step size. A fixed-step-size method called the biased coin design (BCD) (Durham & Flournoy, 1993, 1995) with small step size is also recommended.

A ”suppression effects” is said to occur when the introduction of a second conditional premise of the form ”if A, then Q” following ”if P, then Q” leads to a significant decrease in the rate of endorsed conditional arguments. If ”A” is necessary condition or requirement of ”Q” occurring, then ”if A, then Q” is called ”additional conditional”, which suppresses valid inferences (MP & MT). If ”A” and ”P” are alternatives of each other, then ”if A, then Q” is called ”alternative conditional”, which decreases fallacies of invalid inferences (AC & DA). According to the mental model theorists, alternative or additional conditionals can offer reasoners available counterexamples, lead to reject the putative conclusion. However, the mental logic theorists deemed an additional conditional introducing uncertainty into the major premises, then the uncertainty transferred to the conclusion. Liu (2003) posed the successive-conditionalization approach for explaining conditional reasoning. In this approach, reasoners are assumed to compute the probability of the conclusion, conditionalizing first on the categorical premise, giving the knowledge-based component, and conditionalizing then on the conditional-statement premise, from which the assumption-based component is derived. In the light of the successive-conditionalization approach, almost all reasoners in the MP inferences, and some reasoners in the MT inferences could proceed two stages conditionalization. However in the case of DA/AC, reasoners can carry out firststage conditionalization, but never achieve second-stage conditionalization. There were two experiments, in which Exp. 1 was manipulated for the fallacies, and Exp2 for valid inferences, investigate suppression effects in successive-conditionalization approach. The results of the two experiments found when the introduction of an additional or an alternative conditional, the ratings for MP/MT or DA/AC can be shown mathematically that the results of the secondstage conditionalization is the same as that of the first-stage conditionalization. In other words, the suppression effects of conditional reasoning can be said they only reflect the outcomes of the first-stage conditionalization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200912-200912290076-200912290076-397-413,51.4,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The present study used Latent semantic analysis (LSA) to create a Chinese semantic space. The semantic relationship between words in the Chinese semantic space was estimated by taking the dot product (cosine) between two vectors. The semantic relationship between two sentences or two documents could be estimated in the same way.

New materials were designed which were two surfaces crossed each other and both extended a wide range of depths. In experiment 1, the operation of SBA was preliminarily confirmed. In experiment 2, validity effects were found in both exogenous and endogenous orienting, that confirmed the operation of SBA. In experiment 3, the cue type (valid, invalid, and neutral) and the cue-to-target SOA (120, 300, 500, and 1,000 ms) were manipulated. The results showed that the facilitation of cued surface was found under exogenous orienting when SOA was short. But as the SOA increased, inhibition of the uncued surface was found instead. Under endogenous orienting, inhibition of the uncued surface was found generally. In conclusion, SBA can be triggered by either exogenous or endogenous orienting.

Multiple Ways to Subjective Well-being: The Divergence and Convergence of Double Self-construals in Taiwan,"Chin-Lung Chien, Mei-Chih Li, Li-Li Huang","harmony, self-esteem, structural equation modeling, subjective well-being, bicultural self","This study aimed to explore and verify the multiple paths from the double self-construals (independent self and interdependent self) to subjective well-being (SWB). From the cross-cultural viewpoint, independent self was proposed to be the predictor of SWB, acting through the mediating variable ”global self-esteem”; whereas interdependent self was the predictor of SWB, acting through ”fitting-harmony”. Besides the two selves' divergent ways toward SWB, a way converging on self-esteem was proposed in this study. That is, fitting-harmony was hypothesized to be an important domain on which self-esteem is contingent; therefore, self-esteem might also be a mediator for the interdependent self to SWB. However, interdependent self might have a negative direct effect on self-esteem, which could cause damage to SWB. As mentioned above, the ”multiple causal pathway model” (MCPM) was constructed for empirical investigation.
A survey was conducted to a Taiwanese sample, and 401 valid questionnaires were collected and used for this study. Participants completed the items of measurement scales for independent self, interdependent self, self-esteem, fitting-harmony, and SWB. The results indicated that the strengths of both selves were high in the Taiwanese sample, and the strength of interdependent self was even higher than that of independent self. Most importantly, it was verified that MCPM tested by structural equation modeling was theoretically acceptable, and the multiple (divergent and convergent) paths from two self-construals to SWB were supported. Finally, the limitations, implications, and future research directions were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200912-200912290076-200912290076-453-470,51.4,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

By using cluster sampling, 360 participants were collected from three district officials. We excluded 161 participants who were illiterate as well as those with surgically induced menopause due to hysterectomy and/or bilateral ovariectomy. The final sample was 199 women, aged 40 to 60 years, recruited from the community. We used the Ko Depression Inventory and the Chinese version of the Modified Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime for assessment and data collection. Moreover, each woman underwent a face-to-face semi-structured diagnostic interview to obtain her lifetime psychiatric history. Through item-analyses, the KDI was revised into a 14-item version with an internal consistency of 0.84 and split-half reliability of 0.79. Using a cutoff point of 10, the revised KDI showed the sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 84.9% in prospectively detecting major depression disorder and dysthymic disorder among climacteric women in Taiwan. The Short-Form version of KDI with favorable reliability and validity proved a good screening tool for depression among climacteric women in Taiwan.

The Impact of Interparental Conflict on Children's Adjustment: The Role of Children's Emotional and Cognitive Responses,"Li-Yu Shyu, Wen-Yau Hsu","threat, interparenal conflict, emotional security, self-blame, internalizing behavior","This study integrated the concepts of the emotional security hypothesis (Davies & Cummings, 1994) and the cognitive contextual framework (Grych & Fincham, 1990). Children's emotional and cognitive responses to interparental conflict were identified as mediators of the association between interparental conflict and children's adjustment. The model postulating discrete emotional-cognitive factors and the integrated model of emotional-security, self-blame, and perceived threat were examined. The purpose of this examination was to see whether there was a set of specific, unique mediators that can be applied to further clinical child intervention. 411 five-grade children, their parents and teachers participated in the study. The SEM results indicated that these models provide a good fit to the data. Two models had different implications for application. The association between interparental conflict and child adjustment was fully mediated by emotional-cognitive factors. The findings suggested that children had a variety of specific, unique emotional and cognitive responses to interparental conflict that place them at risk for internalizing and externalizing problems. The results of integrated model indicated that the integrated concepts of emotional-security, self-blame, and perceived threat partially mediated the relation between interparental conflict and child adjustment. The integrated concepts can't provide a complete account of the mechanism explaining associations between interparental conflict and child adjustment. This study demonstrated that the differentiation of children's emotional and cognitive responses into specific factors provided a useful framework for clinical child practitioners to understand how children's responses to interparental conflict place children at risk for internalizing and externalizing problems.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200912-200912290076-200912290076-483-500,51.4,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Assessment of the Organizational Construct of Mastery Motivation: The Reliability and Validity in Infants of 9 Months Old,"Su-Ying Huang, Keng-Ling Lay, Yi-Chieh Chen","parent-child interaction, mastery motivation, Q-sort, infant, organizational perspective","Mastery motivation (MM) emerges as early as in infancy and has been regarded as an important developmental precursor for later achievement motivation. Traditionally, MM was defined and measured in terms of infant independent effort, persistence, and maintaining focused to gain control over the environment. However, other than the instrumental and expressive definition of MM postulated by Barrett and Morgan (1995), social relatedness (Ryan & Deci, 2000), self-regulation of effort (Boekaerts, 2006), resourcefulness (Waters & Sroufe, 1983; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2005), and the adaptive organization of the above behaviors (Seifer & Vaughn, 1995) may also contribute to the individual differences of MM. The present study adopted the organizational perspective and developed a new observational scheme for assessing MM. The Q-set of Mastery Motivation for Infants and Toddlers (QMMIT; English version is available through contacting Keng-Ling Lay) consists of 63 items distributed in 14 subscales of (1) Task Interest, (2) Task Goals, (3) Engagement Style, (4) Involvement, (5) Volition, (6) Relatedness with Significant Others, (7) Reaction to Others' Help, (8) Resourcefulness, (9) Social Dependency, (10) Negative Emotional Reaction to Challenges, (11) Negative Behavioral Reaction to Challenges, (12) Self–Evaluation, (13) Reaction to Success, and (14) General Mood States. Study 1 tested if the newly elaborated definition of MM can be differentiated against other socioemotional constructs. Participants were ten psychology professionals and four college students. Their tasks were to define the hypothetically most mastery oriented, securely attached, positive-emotion laden, sociable, and socially desirable child by using the QMMIT. Results demonstrated that, after controlling for social desirability, MM was a discrete construct from attachment security and sociability. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests further indicated that at least one forth of the items in the QMMIT significantly differentiated the organizational construct of MM from positive emotion, attachment security, and sociability. Study 2 examined the reliability and the convergent and discriminant validity of the QMMIT. Fifty-three mothers and their 9-month-olds completed two sessions of problem-solving tasks scheduled two weeks apart. Developmental quotient measured by the Mullen Scale and maternal report on the Dimensions of Mastery Questionnaire (DMQ infant version, 17th ed.) were also collected. Results indicated acceptable cross-time (r(18)=.50) and cross-task (r(18)=.52) reliability of the QMMIT. The Cronbach's αs of 12 out of the 14 subscales in the QMMIT were higher than .60. To document the convergent validity, Object-Oriented Total Involvement (OOTI; sum of engagement style, involvement, and volition) and the Mastery Organization Score (MOS; correlation with the criterion sort of MM) both assessed by the QMMIT were positively correlated with infant persistent behaviors assessed by the DMQ. To document the discriminant validity, neither the correlation between the Resourcefulness assessed by the QMMIT and the social aspect of mastery behaviors assessed by the DMQ nor the correlation between OOTI and the indices of social and gross-motor domain of persistence assessed by the DMQ was significant. Moreover, that MOS was not correlated with developmental quotient indicated that MM measured by the QMMIT is not a reflection of general cognitive competence.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200912-200912290076-200912290076-501-526,51.4,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Estimating Missing Sampling Weights by Using LVQ-ESW Method in a CFA Model,"Chih-Chien Yang, Liang-Ting Tsai, Chih-Chiang Yang","MAR, Estimated Stratum Weights, Missing at Random, LVQ, CFA","The paper proposes estimated missing stratum weights (ESW) to infer populationwise parameters of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models in a stratified sampling survey. In large survey research, using stratum weights has been proved to be able to ensure proper statistical inferences for populationwise parameters in CFA models (e.g., 蔡良庭、 楊志堅，2008; Asparouhov, 2005; Yang & Tsai, 2006) and others (e.g., Little, 1991). Similarly, importance of properly dealing with missing at random (MAR) data (e.g., Little & Rubin, 1987; Little & Schenker, 1994) in survey research cannot be overemphasized. Yet, methods to analyze observations with missing stratum weights received less attention than they should.
The estimated stratum weights (ESW) is thus proposed to impute missing weights of observations; specifically, ESW is implemented by optimumizing learning vector quantization networks (LVQ) (蔡良庭、楊志堅，2004; White, 1989). Experimental factors, including missing proportions, sampling sizes, unbalanced stratifications and stratified variations, are designed to examine performances of LVQ-ESW in numerical simulation studies. Results show that accuracies and stabilities of LVQ-ESW are much better than the other two methods in all categories of comparisons. Conclusions and discussions are provided for some practical guidelines.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200909-51-3-277-293-a,51.3,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Are Parents Never Wrong? The Influence of Chinese Parents Role Obligation on Parent-Child Conflict and Relationship,"Shih-Chi Hsu, Li-Li Huang","family ethic, superficial harmony, genuine harmony, role norm, obligation-based","Previous studies in cultural Chinese context on the conflict between children and their parents mostly adopted a western ”right-based” perspective to identify conflict without considering whether the perspective is fitted to view cultural Chinese parent-child conflict. This study used an ”obligation-based” perspective taken by children to explore parent-child conflict events and their relation. Three empirical studies were employed.
In study 1, a questionnaire was used to survey 236 university students. The results showed that university students could classify their parents' behaviors into different kinds of obligations. While obligations could be fulfilled or violated, these conditions were then added into the classifications and used for study 2. In study 2, open-ended questions were given to 65 university students, and written description of 308 parent-child conflict experiences, including conflict events and the relation after the conflict, were collected. The results of content analysis showed clear indication of an obligation-based conflict event framework, as our research constructed. Furthermore, three kinds of conflict events, ”fulfill positive obligation”, ”violate uncompulsory obligation” and ”violate compulsory obligation” were best predictors of parent-child relation after conflict. In study 3, scenario questions were given to university students to examine the effects of parent-child conflict in genuine or superficial relationships. 295 valid questionnaires were collected. Parentchild relationship prior to the conflict, described as a genuine harmony or a superficial harmony, was found to moderate the relationship after conflict. When parents fulfilled positive obligation, the parent-child relation after conflict was better for those in a genuine harmony than the ones in a superficial harmony. Those in a genuine harmony would even remain a positive parent-child relation after conflict. When parents violated compulsory obligation, the parent-child relation after conflict became negative regardless of whether the prior relationship was genuine or superficial, and the two showed no significant difference. Finally, the implications and future research directions were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200909-51-3-295-317-a,51.3,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Forty nine Taiwanese newly-married couples were interviewed to obtain graphs of changes in commitment during courtship and reasons for the changes, which were coded into eight categories. Three years later, data revealed their marital adjustment processes and outcomes were collected. Longitudinal data were analyzed using regression and MONOVA methods. Three major findings were unveiled. First, compared to those who met due to environmental propinquity or intermediary of a third party, couples met in accidental (chance) conditions perceived more difficulty balancing their work and family after marriage. Second, husbands’ adjustment difficulty on work and family was related to premarital interaction with social network and other circumstantial events while wives' level of dyadic adjustment difficulty was predicted by their evaluation of the partner against a predetermined standard and their perceived positiveness of premarital dyadic interaction. Finally, courtships with high volatility were found to result in lower level of dyadic adjustment and marital satisfaction. Because couples with unstable courtship pattern, compared to those with stable courtship pattern used more negative (passive) coping strategies, they therefore developed passive and negative adjustment patterns and may more easily subject to later marital dissolution.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200909-51-3-319-339-a,51.3,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Difference of in-group Modesty between Japanese and Taiwanese,"Shingo Daidohji, Kwang-Kuo Hwang","public, modesty, relative honorific expression, in-group, out-group","The purpose of this study is to investigate the difference of norms of modesty between Japanese and Taiwanese. Due to the difference of social structures among East Asian countries, when a person describes his in-group members to an outsider in a modest way, he may represent it in either relative or absolute honorific expressions. Study 1 focused on relative / absolute honorific expressions featuring the comparative linguistics of East Asian countries, and inferred that: when a person describes his in-group members to an out-group target, there is not only linguistic, but also behavioral and psychological differences between customs of Japan and Taiwan. Results of Study 1 indicated that, in Japanese culture, speaker’s in-group modesty is promoted when the relationship between speaker and target who belongs to out-group was intimate. Vice versa, it is restrained when it was not intimate. In contrast with Japan, this factor does not influence the in-group modesty in Taiwanese culture. In order to explain this difference, Study 2 studied model of traditional socialstructure in Japan and Confucian thoughts in Taiwan. Results of Study 2 indicated that, if there exist ”upper public” above one self (in-group) and target (out-group) in Japanese culture, in-group modesty is restrained. However, this factor does not influence the in-group modesty in Taiwanese culture. It was inferred through these studies that Japanese judge in-/outgroup according to each family's relation to the nested structure of public. But Taiwanese make the judgment according to one's relation with each ”independent family”.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200909-51-3-341-358-a,51.3,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Subjects include normal and delinquent juveniles, the effective sample size is 1,905. Anonymous self-report questionnaire is adopted to collect data. Variables measured in the questionnaire involved depressive and schizophrenic symptom (internalizing symptoms), antisocial and aggressive behavior (externalizing symptoms), parental discipline, parent-child relationship, parent-child conflict, parental mental illness, family atmosphere (family factor), and demographic data. The scales in the questionnaire show acceptable reliability and validity. The results of the study indicate that the extent of co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms is decreased but still with significance under the control of family factor in the normal juveniles, however the extent of co-occurrence is significantly lowered in the delinquent juveniles. Besides, the degree of co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in delinquent juveniles is lower than normal juveniles, and both internalizing and externalizing symptoms are more severe in delinquent juveniles than normal juveniles. The results above-mentioned indicate that the hypotheses of the study are all supported. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are addressed. Suggestions for future research include: engaging in longitudinal study to testify the impact of family factor, doing experimental research to examine the mechanism of co-occurrence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, finding out other shared risky factor of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in juveniles, sending for parents and teachers to assess juveniles to cross-validate the data.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200909-51-3-359-374-a,51.3,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Guess What I think? The Reliability and Validity of Chinese Theory of Mind Tasks and Performance in the Elderly,"Zai-Ting Yeh, Mau-Sun Hua, Shen-Ing Liu","theory of mind, false belief, reliability, Faux Pas task, validity","Purpose: Theory of Mind (ToM) refers to the ability to represent mental states, such as beliefs and intentions, and is distinct from the ability to represent 'real' states of affairs. It enables us to make attributions and to reason about mental states and, in doing so, to understand and predict the behavior of other people. Research has suggested that theory of mind may represent a dissociable, modular brain system that is related to, but separable from, other brain functions, including memory, language, and executive functions. Studies with neuroimaging provide further evidence that the ventromedial regions of the prefrontal cortex are associated with ToM.
However, the Chinese standardized instrument of brain function of the vertromedial prefrontal cortex is lacking in Taiwan. Thus, it is indeed a pressing task to establish a related assessment tool. Validation of this tool will provide an appropriate research implement for studying the concept of mental reasoning that could also be used as a functional index of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in clinical neuropsychological settings. The purposes of this study were to establish the reliability and validity of theory of mind tasks and to explore whether healthy elderly people exhibit impairment on those tasks.
Method: 175 subjects aged from 18 to 88, and 15 subjects with autism and Asperger's syndrome, were recruited as the normal and clinical groups, respectively. We also completed test-retest measurement of 30 subjects from the normal group. The groups were controlled for level of education, level of intelligence, and memory. The materials used for the theory of mind tasks included false beliefs, Faux Pas, implication stories, and non-verbal tasks.
Result: The results showed that there is acceptable reliability and validity in that Chinese theory of mind tasks except false beliefs. There is no significant difference between young and elderly adult on these tasks, even with memory function and socio-economic status taken into account.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200909-51-3-375-395-a,51.3,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Monocular and Binocular Occlusion Cues on Stereoscopic Image Recovery,"Wei-Li Tu, Shojiro Sakurai","binocular disparity, illusory contour, occlusion, monocular occlusion cue, legal occlusion, right-eye-only/left-eye-only","Shimojo and Nakayama (1990) pointed that for real world scenes there are opto-geometrical constraints which determine whether particular combinations of relative depth and right-eye-only or left-eye-only stimuli are ecologically valid or invalid. Moreover, Nakayama, Shimojo, and Silverman (1989) suggested that occlusion relation composing of monocular occlusion cue and binocular disparity is important to image recovery. Experiment 1 examined the importance of occlusion relation in illusory contour (IC) formation and depth discrimination task which were designed for different binocular and monocular occlusion conditions. The exp1 result showed that both binocular disparity and monocular occlusion cue are essential to stereoscopic IC recovery. The absence of either cue or conflict of each other reduced the task performance of participants, while the congruence condition generated the best. Experiment 2 used similar condition of Bacon and Mamassian (2002), but manipulated three kinds of background and occluder to test the influence of occlusion relation, and the suggestion Bacon and Mamassian showed that amodal completion allows visual system to assign stereoscopic depth in the absence of binocular correspondence. Although the main effect of occlusion relation in exp2 wasn't significant, there was a trend that legal occlusion relation improved the possibility of task performance corresponding to the true experimental condition. On the basis of different concave-response rate in different kinds of background and occluder, we may take Bacon and Mamassian's study as a special case and suggest that the more binocular correspondence unit be, the more stable depth we will capture. Our results supported that both monocular and binocular occlusion cues play important roles in stereoscopic image recovery, and the interaction between these two cues might indicate the integration of two processing channels.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200906-200906260096-200906260096-139-156,51.2,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Auditory Discrimination of Mandarin Retroflex Contrasts and Spectral Moment Analysis,Jing-Yi Jeng,"auditory recognition, moments, spectral retroflex, M1, Mandarin fricatives","There are three pairs of retroflex contrasts in Mandarin fricative and affricates, and perceptually, they are very similar and not easy to be distinguished, especially for non-skilled listeners. The purpose of this study is to investigate the auditory perception of retroflexation of Mandarin in adults and investigate the relationship between the spectral moments of frication noise and the auditory discrimination of the fricatives and affricates with retroflexed contrasts. There were thirty adults of native Mandarin speakers participating in the retroflex recognition tasks. There were two tasks of retroflexation judgment in the experiment. In the first one task, the monosyllabic words were used as stimuli and the listeners were asked to judge the retroflexation of Mandarin monosyllabic words. In the second task, the disyllabic words were used, and the retroflexation of the first syllables of words was required to be judged.
In the first task, the monosyllable stimuli had three degrees of retroflexation variations which was consciously made by the speakers, including nonretroflexation, slightly retroflexation, and more retroflexation. The results show that if the slightly retroflexed stimuli were excluded, the correctness percentage of responds was 78% for all listeners. The highly retroflexed consonants had the significantly shortest reaction time (RT), while the RTs between the nonretroflexed and the slightly retroflexed had no significant difference. According to the retroflexness categorical responses of the listeners, the spectral moment analysis of the stimuli showed that the retroflexed consonants had significantly lower M1, higher M2, higher M3, and lower M4, compared to the nonretroflxed consonants. The results are compatible with the data of the previous study of retroflex production (Jeng, 2005). Among the four spectral moments, M1 was the most robust parameter for discriminating the retroflex contrasts The correlation coefficient between the retroflex response percentages and M1 of the stimuli was -0.61 (p＜.0001). In the second task, the listeners were asked to judge the retroflexation of the first syllables of the disyllabic words based on their acoustical retroflexation, instead of their lexical retroflexation. However the results show that the retroflexation judgment of the listeners was inevitably influenced by the lexical information of the second syllables of the words. Among the four spectral moments, M1 still the most robust parameter for discriminating the retroflex contrasts. The interaction of the lexical information and acoustical information during the retroflexation judgment of the disyllabic words was discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200906-200906260096-200906260096-157-173,51.2,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Individual Differences of Temperament and Parenting Stressin Preschoolers with Autism,,autism；individual differences；parenting stress；temperament,"Children with autistic spectrum disorders vary significantly in developmental ability, symptomatology, as well as emotional and behavioral patterns. The large variance in behavioral and emotional patterns poses a major challenge to parents and clinical workers while interacting with children with autism. This research tested whether temperament, as an important area in understanding the individual differences of normal children, poses a unique contribution to the stress of parenting in children with autism. Forty-five Chinese mothers of male preschoolers diagnosed as autism (CA = 3 yr. 1 mo. to 7 yr. 7 mo.; MA = 1 yr. 5 mo. to 6 yr. 3 mo.) residing in Taiwan completed the Behavioral Style Questionnaire (BSQ-Chinese version; Carey & McDevitt, 1978), the Chinese Children Developmental Inventory (CCDI; Hsu & Hsu, 1976), the Clancy Checklist (Chinese version; Hsieh, Soong, & Hsu, 1983), and the Parenting Stress Index–Short Form (PSI/SF, Abidin, 1995) for assessing temperament, developmental age, autistic symptomatology, and perceived parenting stress, respectively. Results indicated acceptable internal consistency and six-month test-retest reliability of BSQ
subscales for assessing autistic population. Compared with the BSQ scores of 243 normal male preschoolers between age
five and seven residing in Taipei (Wang, 2003), preschoolers with autism received significantly higher scores in activity
level (M = 4.11, SD = 1.01) and intensity of reaction (M = 4.07, SD = 1.09), and poorer scores in rhythmicity (M = 4.23,
SD = .79), adaptability (M = 4.62, SD = 1.02), and attention span and persistence (M = 3.44, SD = .97). They were also
less likely to be distracted (M = 3.94, SD = .95). In addition, larger group variances were found in the autistic sample
on the dimensions of activity level, adaptability, quality of mood (M = 4.70, SD = .96), threshold of responsiveness (M
= 3.83, SD = 1.08), and intensity of reaction. None of the dimensions yielded smaller variance for the autistic group
than their normal counterparts. The severity of autistic symptomatology was significantly correlated with four BSQ
dimensions, namely, activity level, adaptability, distractability, and approach/withdrawal (M = 3.88, SD = 1.02), rs =
.30, -.30, -.55, -.41, ps ＜ .05. The fact that there was a fair range of within-group temperamental differences among
children with autism and that there were five BSQ dimensions not significantly related to autistic symptomatology yields
that some of the BSQ dimensions may be regarded as independent constructs from the autistic symptomatology. In
addition, hierarchical regression analyses yielded that after controlling for developmental ability and symptomatology, the
dimensions of activity level, quality of mood, threshold of responsiveness, and intensity of reaction were still significant
predicators for parenting stress. These four temperamental dispositions thus may be especially effective in predicting
stressful parenting. This study also suggested that the dimensions of distractibility and threshold of responsiveness
in BSQ may need to further break up into several distinctive aspects to better grasp the individual differences among
children with autism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200906-200906260096-200906260096-175-196,51.2,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

It was also to explore the relationships between triangulation and the adjustment of intimate relationship. 445 college students from ten universities in Taipei area were recruited. The measurements of ＜||＞Parent-Child Triangulation Scale＜||＞ and ＜||＞Intimate Relationship Accommodation Scale＜||＞ were utilized to investigate the subjects. Statistical methods of cluster analysis was applied to analyze the data. Results indicate that three types of triangulation, namely, ＜||＞Parentification＜||＞, ＜||＞Avoidance/Distance＜||＞ and ＜||＞Enmeshment/Dependence＜||＞ were derived both for male and female college students. Although male college students perceived more parental conflict, female college students reported better adjustment of intimate relationship. Surprisingly, those who without the reactions of coalition, scapegoating and parentification did not show better adjustment as predicted. However, those who involved parental conflict and identified as parentified children perceived the better feeling of autonomy and flexiability.

The Influence of Provided and Received Supports among Taiwanese Married Couples,"Yuh-Huey Jou, Yeu-Sheng Hsieh","married couples, hierarchical linear model, marital quality, provided and received support, latent class analysis","This paper examined the received and provided supports between married couple from both individual-and couplelevel point of views, and evaluated whether marital intimacy and marital quality of couples differ by their supportreceiving and providing pattern. The analyzed data are from 452 Taiwanese married couples. The analysis of variance, latent class analysis, and hierarchical linear model are utilized to analyze the data. Results indicated that those who received more support than provided reported higher marital intimacy and better quality, either for wives or for husbands. By using the latent class models, the patterns of couples' support received and provided were identified four distinct groups, named 'husband-underbenefited and wife-overbenefited couple,' 'husband-overbenefited and wife-underbenefited couple,' 'dual overbenefited couple' and 'dual underbenefited couple.' From the individual point of view, both the wives who belong to 'husband-underbenefited and wife-overbenefited couple' and the husbands who belong to 'husbandoverbenefited and wife-underbenefited couple' reported the highest marital intimacy and best quality, respectively. Either wives or husbands who belongs to 'dual underbenefited couple,' however, reported the lowest intimacy and worst quality. Finally, from the couple point of view, while 'husband-underbenefited and wife-overbenefited' or 'husband-overbenefited and wife-underbenefited' couples showed the best marital quality, the 'dual underbenefited' couple showed the worst marital quality. The results implied that the couple interaction in terms of support received and provided and its effects on marital relationship in the Taiwanese families exhibit its cultural distinction which is different from those found in the western societies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200906-200906260096-200906260096-215-234,51.2,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

An Empirical Investigation of Religious Behavior's Influence on Prosocial Behavior and Psychological Well-Being with Spirituality as a Mediating Variable,"Tung-Shan Chou, Hie-Wu Su","spirituality, mental health, religion","The past studies of the efficacy of religion in relation to mental health appear to have some conflicting results. The present study broadens the construct of religion to include both religious behavior and the concept of spirituality, and the construct of mental health to include psychological well-being and prosocial behavior. Three waves of questionnaire data were collected across Taiwan, resulting in a final sample of 412 full-time Taiwanese college students classified into four self-reported religious orientations: Buddhist, Christian, Taiwanese folklore follower and no-religion. The statistical procedures of ANOVA and covariance structure analysis are used to provide the empirical basis for the conclusions.
The self-reported religious orientation appears to have a strong significant effect with respect to displaying religious behavior and degree of spirituality, a weak albeit significant effect on the degree of psychological well-being, and virtually no significant effect on prosocial behavior. The results from covariance structure analysis indicate that both the direct effect of religious behavior on prosocial behavior and the indirect effect through spirituality on prosocial behavior have gained empirical support. The religious behavior factor seems unable to account for the psychological well-being aspect of mental health. When the religion construct is replaced by the spirituality concept alone, a strong indirect link between religion and prosocial behavior is found through the mediating effect of psychological well-being. There is no direct causal relationship found between spirituality and prosocial behavior.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200906-200906260096-200906260096-251-275,51.2,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Through the investigation of current research design of the developmental psychology, researcher traced the reasoning mechanism of the different conceptions among seventy two 3-to 6-year-old children more deeply. The results showed that young children's ability of causal thinking was beyond the estimation of previous researches and 3-to 4-year-olds had an emerging understanding of life being: (1) 3-year-olds were able to predict the underlying structure of life being and to understand the difference of internal structure among animals, plants and machines effectively. Until 5 years of age, this ability were getting mature. (2) 4-year-olds appeared to be aware of innate potential of life being and were able to predict the development of baby life being. It was not until age 6 that children demonstrated a better understanding of the developmental tendency of seeds. (3) 3-year-olds were beginning to realize the constant identity of life being regardless of the operation and deforming. Until around age 6, children's understanding was then mature. Conclusively, young children employed psychological essentialism in an abstract to concrete shift while doing causal reasoning of biological phenomena.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200903-51-1-1-19-a,51.1,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Proofreading Errors and Reading Units in Chinese Texts,"Chien-Hui Kao, Chih-Wei Hue, Yu-Hsiang Tseng, Ming Lo","word inferiority effect, Chinese reading, word recognition, eye movement","Hue (1989) reported a word inferiority effect in detecting character-position transposed words embedded in text. To explain the phenomenon, he cited Healy's (1976) unitization model, and argued that ”word” is a reading unit of Chinese. Furthermore, he argued that in word recognition, a word's orthographic configuration is important cue, and that the word inferiority effect he found was caused because a character-position transposed word still possesses its orthographic configuration. The present study was a follow up of Hue's experiment, and in particular, was designed to test his theory concerning how the word inferiority effect is produced. In Experiment 1, the participants' eye movements were recorded while they were detecting misprints in the reading materials which were presented on a computer screen in two different writing directions (vertical vs. horizontal). There were four types of misprinted two-character words: 1. High frequency words with characters transposed in position, 2. low frequency words with characters transposed in position, 3. words with their second character replaced by an orthographically similar one, and 4. words with their second character replaced by a phonologically similar character (controls). The experimental results show that writing direction neither affected the detection rate nor the skip rate of the four types of misprints. Compared with the detection rate of the controls, the detection rates of the other three types of misprints are lower (i.e., word inferiority effect). In Experiment 2, the vertical printing condition of Experiment 1 was replicated, only that in Experiment 2, the reading materials were printed on papers. These results suggest that two-character words can be reading units of Chinese and, in word recognition, a word's orthographic configuration is important cue. However, the results of the present study also indicate that Hue's idea concerning how the word inferiority effect is caused is not correct.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200903-51-1-21-36-a,51.1,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Effects of Systematic Information Processing on the Ambivalence of Well-Established and Newly Formed Attitudes,"Chuan-Feng Kao, Shih-Hsien Lin","systematic information processing, issue involvement, attitudinal ambivalence, need for cognition, target entitativity","Attitudinal ambivalence refers to the extent to which individuals' attitudes toward an attitude object include both positive and negative evaluations. Some research suggests that higher need for cognition and greater involvement with social issue, are associated respectively with less attitudinal ambivalence. Other research suggests that individuals with ambivalent attitudes are more likely to engage in systematic processing of relevant information. To explore the relation between systematic information processing and ambivalent attitudes, Study 1 used a correlational strategy to assess participants’ need for cognition, attitudinal ambivalence toward five social issues, and the degree of involvement in the issues. Results replicated prior findings of a negative relation not only between attitudinal ambivalence and need for cognition, but also between attitudinal ambivalence and issue involvement. In Study 2, participants were provided with positive and negative mixed-valence information about a social target. The entitativity of attitude objects (individual vs. group) and the levels of cognitive load were manipulated, and participants’ need for cognition was assessed. Results showed higher attitudinal ambivalence for the individual than the group target. Participants high in need for cognition had high attitudinal ambivalence regardless of the attitude objects and the levels of cognitive load, those low in need for cognition had lower attitudinal ambivalence toward the group than the individual target when they were under high cognitive load. The results of Study 2 suggested an influence of systematic processing on the formation of ambivalent attitudes. These results suggest that, for well-established attitudes, attitudinal ambivalence relates negatively to personality-based and motivational antecedents of systematic processing, whereas systematic processing of positive and negative mixed-valence information about a new attitude object can result in high attitudinal ambivalence.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200903-51-1-37-55-a,51.1,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

She described 10 ego stages that individuals develop in sequences throughout life span. These ego stages include presocial and symbiotic, impulsive, self-protective, conformist, self-aware, conscientious, individualistic, autonomous, and integrated. The purposes of this study were to examine ego development of college students in Taiwan by using Loevinger's WUSCT, and to investigate the relationships of ego development with cognitive development characters, personality and the impact of college life experiences. Subjects were 465 college students from 6 universities located in the areas of Taoyuan and Hsinchu. They completed the scales of Washington University Sentence Completion Test, the Scale of Intellectual Development, Neo-Five Factor Inventory, and College Student's Life Events. The results indicated that the average stage of college students in Taiwan is Self-Aware stage. Female students reported a higher level of ego level than male students did; students who major in engineering displayed a lower level of ego stage than the students who major in management, education, and humanities and social science. Moreover, students with higher levels of relativistic thinking, empathy, openness to experiences, and intellectual inspiration from learning showed a higher level of ego stage. In addition, openness to experience fully mediated the relationship between intellectual inspiration and ego development for male, whereas openness to experience and empathy partially mediated the same relationships for female.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200903-51-1-57-80-a,51.1,2009,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Five hundred and twenty five Taiwanese married couples filled out a questionnaire which included seven factors of conflict-coping strategies: reason appeal, concealment and cold war, tolerance and acquiescence endurance, nagging, self-harm, others, intercession, and roundabout appeal; two aspects of interaction: conflict and received support; and two marital quality: satisfaction and regret. Latent class analysis and hierarchical linear models were applied. Results showed that the patterns of couples' conflict-coping strategies can be identified as 'rarely use tactic,' 'fighting and cold war,' 'direct moderation' and 'try diversely'. Those who received more support reported higher marital quality. Conflict had a negative effect on marital quality, but this effect disappeared depending on conflict-coping strategy pattern. Martial quality varied by different patterns of conflict-coping strategies. Those 'indirect moderation' couples reported higher support and marital quality, followed by 'try diversely,' and 'fighting and cold war' couples reported the lowest support. However, 'rarely use tactic' couples showed higher support, higher satisfaction, but higher regret. The interaction term of marital interaction and conflict-coping strategy pattern showed a significant effect on marital quality.

Supervisor Perceived Subordinate's Loyalty to Supervisor in Chinese Business Organizations,Ding-Yu Jiang,"inductive approach, employee categorization model, Chinese organizational behavior, loyalty to supervisor","Recent studies have investigated the loyalty to supervisor phenomena from subordinates' perspectives and have several important findings. However, the loyalty to supervisor construct has different meanings for supervisors and subordinates because supervisors and subordinates have clearly unequal power bases and resources in Chinese business organizations. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the construct and the content of supervisors' perceptions of subordinates' loyalty to supervisors and to develop a measurement instrument for this construct through two separate studies. In study 1, 357 statements were collected from 61 supervisors. Through an inductive approach, nine main categories of how supervisors perceive subordinates' loyalty to supervisor were found in this study. In study 2, based on findings from study 1, 51 measurement items were developed. After confirmatory categorization process, 9 items were excluded. Then, through survey process, three different samples were collected, including Taiwanese and Chinese organizations. 5 factors and 20 measurement items were developed and validated by exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. These five factors are: ”adhering to hierarchy,” ”modesty to comments,” ”taking care of personal affaires,” ”fulfilling job duties,” and ”assisting in managerial activities. Internal consistency coefficient for this measurement was .95 Criteria related analyses showed that supervisor perceived subordinate's loyalty to supervisor was positively associated with supervisors' trust in subordinates and supervisors' rating of subordinates' job performance. These result findings indicated that the supervisor perceive subordinates' loyalty to supervisor measurement had appropriate reliability and validity.

Without a measurement of the time to switch attention from one location to another in the absence of objects, it is not possible to assess the relative costs or benefits of objects on attention.

In a typical inhibition of return paradigm, a peripheral location was exogenously cued, following which attention was disengaged from the cued location. Thereafter, return to the cued location was inhibited. Although attentional disengagement from the cued location was a critical component in inhibition of return, the effect of a fixation cue following the peripheral cue on eliciting exogenously triggered attentional disengagement was not fully tested. The present study examined the effect of this fixation cue, while endogenous attentional disengagement was varied across the experiments.

Gender-Distinct Effects of Trauma Exposure on Posttraumatic Stress Reactions and Social Relations in Adolescents Following the 921 Chi-Chi Earthquake in Taiwan,"Chih-Hsun Wu, Sue-Huei Chen, Li-Jen Weng, Yin-Chang Wu","PTSD symptoms, trauma exposure, gender difference, social relation, Taiwan 921 Earthquake","The Earthquake Exposure-Social Relations-Posttraumatic Stress (ESP) model was proposed to clarify the relations among trauma exposure (objective and subjective), social relations (supportive and detrimental), and posttraumatic stress responses. This study recruited the adolescents who had been exposed to a large-scale natural disaster, the Taiwan 921 Chi-Chi Earthquake. Gender-distinct effects of trauma exposure on social relations and PTSD severity were evaluated using the ESP model. The Earthquake Exposure Index for Youth, UCLA-PTSD Index, and Taiwan Relationship Inventory for Children and Adolescents were given to 871 adolescents living in the epicenter one year after the earthquake. The ESP model was evaluated and cross-validated by structure equation modeling (SEM) method using the data of both boys (n=450) and girls (n=421) separately. Results showed that the ESP model had good overall-fit for both genders. The subjective exposure had significantly greater positive effects on supportive social relations, and objective exposure had greater positive effects on detrimental social relations (especially for girls). Both supportive and detrimental social relations had significantly greater positive effects on PTSD severity. Specifically, the more supportive and/or detrimental social relations the individual perceived, the greater their PTSD severity. The effects of detrimental social relation were relatively larger. Gender difference was found in the paths linking exposure and PTSD severity. While objective exposure had direct positive effects on PTSD severity for boys, subjective exposure had direct positive effects on PTSD severity for girls. These findings pointed out the importance to discriminate between subjective and objective exposure as well as between supportive and detrimental social relations for studying their relations to posttraumatic stress responses. It also suggested that, in helping adolescents exposed to trauma, we should take gender into consideration, and it may be more crucial to deal with detrimental social relations for posttraumatic adjustment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200812-50-4-367-381-a,50.4,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The 10-year Meta-analysis of Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy for Depressive Symptoms,"Yen-Chun Liu, Yu-Ling Lan, Chih-Ju Liu, Yu-Ju Chou","depression, meta-analysis, Cognitive-behavioral group therapy, effect size","In the past decades, the effects of the individual cognitive-behavioral therapy on mild to moderate depression have been supported. With regards to the cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT), a small amount of research has addressed the impacts of different group designs on its therapeutic effect. Moreover, only few meta-analysis studies have tried to integrate these results. However, no recent study has provided systematic information regarding the group characteristics of the CBGT for the past ten years. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to find out the most effective group design of the CBGT to maximize its therapeutic effect for different populations and diagnoses.
One hundred and twenty-six studies included in this study were retrieved from Academic search premier, PsycINFO and Medline, during January 1997 to June 2007. These retrieved papers were screened via the six inclusion criteria by four independent reviewers. Finally, a total of 32 papers were selected in this study, but only half of them had sufficient data to compute the effect size. Two different types of effect sizes -d and eta squared values -were used to compare the magnitudes of the treatment effects across studies. The mean standardized effect size d for 11 selected studies was -0.68, with high heterogeneity. Due to high heterogeneity among these studies, subgroup analyses were used to determine a possible moderator which could put these studies into homogenous groups. Subgroup analyses indicated a stronger effect for the child and adolescent group than the adult group. Also, providing a treatment manual for group members seemed to be an important characteristic of the group design to increase the effect of the CBGT.
Five studies with more complex designs were compared by the magnitudes of their eta squared values. Moderate to large eta squared values for the time main effect indicated a significant improvement of participants, depression symptoms after the CBGT treatment. A small and a large eta squared values for the group main effect suggested a significant but unstable CBGT group effect on depression when comparing with the control group. Moderate eta squared values for the time-group interaction effect implied a possible time-group influence when explaining the CBGT treatment effect.
Furthermore, all selected studies in this study are journal articles, which could lead to overestimate its effect size. The publication bias of this study was evaluated via the funnel plot and the fail-safe N. The result of the funnel plot and the fail-safe N examination of this study suggested a positive publication bias that was not stronger enough to overrule the significant treatment effect of this study.
Due to the diversity of the CBGT studies in the past ten years, the present study was unable to determine key moderators of the group designs to maximize the CBGT treatment effect. More research is needed to ascertain the characteristics of group design to reach the best effect for different populations and diagnoses.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200812-50-4-383-402-a,50.4,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology

A. Bjork, & E. L. Bjork, 1994) to investigate the memory inhibition of stereotypical traits. The results of experiment 1 show that retrieval practice on stereotypical traits impairs not only the later recall of other traits explicitly studied under the same social category, but also similar items under different category cues, providing evidence for cross-category inhibition. Experiment 2 examines whether valence of stereotypical traits will moderate retrieval-induced forgetting. In the retrieval practice phase, participants in our two experimental conditions performed retrieval practice on positive or negative traits of half of the studied social categories; participants in control group retrieved exemplars of a natural category as baseline. The results of experiment 2 demonstrated that positive and negative stereotypical traits are influenced in different ways by retrieval-induced forgetting. Comparing to the control group, participants who retrieved negative traits of half of the studied social categories inhibited memory for positive traits of those social groups; in contrast, participants who performed retrieval practice on positive aspects did not impair memory for negative traits of the practiced social groups. These findings suggest that negative stereotypical traits are dominant in memory and therefore can resist inhibition of retrieval practice.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200812-50-4-403-423-a,50.4,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Newlyweds' Marital Adjustment: Scale Development and Model Testing,"Szu-Chia Chang, Yuh-Huey Jou, Tsung-Chain Huang","adjustment problem scale, marital adjustment, newlyweds, adjustment strategy scale, marital attitude scale","This study tests a theoretical model of newlyweds' marital adjustment proposed by the author based on qualitative data collected in Taiwan. Three measures which included dimensions of marital adjustment, attitude toward marriage, and strategies for dealing with adjustment problem were developed. Two hundred and eighty eight newly married couples (n=576) filled out a questionnaire which contained the measures mentioned above and questions to gather demographic and background information. Results of factor analysis verified the proposed measurement models and high reliabilities were reported for most of the measures. Overall, wives perceived more adjustment difficulties than husbands. Adjustment problems for wives were found to mostly be concerned with their relationships with in-laws and with their spouse. On the other hand, husbands perceived more need balancing their work and family. Both husbands' and wives' level of adjustment difficulties were predicted by their own attitude and the discrepancy between their attitudes toward marriage. Particularly, wives' adjustment difficulties were predicted by their attitude toward patriarchal family system and sex role.
There were also differences in terms of the strategies that husbands and wives used in dealing with adjustment problems. Husbands adopted more intrapersonal-positive (accommodation) and intrapersonal-negative (avoidance) coping strategies while wives used more extrapersonal-negative (aggressive) strategies when faced with adjustment problems. Finally, results of SEM show that although positive coping strategies were found to relate to high marital quality, newlywed husbands and wives tend to use more negative coping strategies when they had more adjustment difficulties. As a consequence, such adjustment pattern would lead to low marital quality. The findings of the present study are expected to lead to the revision of the proposed model and to shed some light on the cultural characteristics that shape marital adjustment processes in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200812-50-4-425-446-a,50.4,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Most studies have figured out that the impact of these aspects on naming performance is constrained by character/word frequency. This study manipulated the ratio of summed frequency of friends and summed frequency of enemies in consideration of the distribution of summed frequency of friends across character frequency. Experiment 1 showed the consistency effects caused by homophonous and the regularity effects caused by non-homophonous changed with the amount of summed frequency of friends. And the size of regularity effect is larger than that of consistency effect in general. In Experiment 2, the strict control of neighborhood characteristics eliminated the interaction of consistency effects and character frequency. However, the magnitude of homophonous was larger than that of heterophonous. These results show that the interactions of character frequency and orthography to phonology correspondence are the various impact of neighborhood characteristic across phonetic-sound correspondences.

Early Understanding of Referential Intent in Toddlers and Young Children: From the Clues of Vocal and Facial Expression,"Chung-Hsin Chiang, Min-Hsiang Chang","referential intent, infants and toddlers, Taiwan","The purpose of the studies were to examine the early understanding others' intention in young children in Taiwan. In the study 1, a referential intent task used the clues of vocal and facial expression by an experimenter for examining whether 24-months-olds children can make difference between intentional and accidental conditions while observing the experimenter's demonstration. Results showed that young children aged 24 months can differentiate the intentional and accidental clues. However, their performances were constrained by the right-hand preference. In the study 2, a revised referential intent task which decreases the effect of handedness preference used to investigate whether 20-month-olds toddlers and 30-month-olds young children can understand others' referential intent. Results revealed that toddlers aged 20 months did not pass the task demand while young children with 30 months not only make differentiation between intentional and accidental conditions, but their performances are not influenced by the handedness preference.
It is inappropriate to indicate that results of the studies showed that early referential intent development in Taiwanese children lagged behind the American children. At least four kinds of issues in methodology are needed to explore first before any conclusion. First, the handedness preference was the important confounding factor to influence the effect of early intention reading. Second, in the studies, we only gave our subjects a chance to choose which box they want and then open the same one, subjects did not have a chance to touch first in advance and then choose and open the other one if possible. Third, after observing experimenter's demonstration, it is possible that this kind of manipulation maximizes the child's attention to the box itself instead of something inside the box. Forth, in the study, finding of vocal cues were via only questionnaires, other measures like semi-structure observation paradigm are needed to explore in depth in the future research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200809-50-3-241-256-a,50.3,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Based on Nolen-Hoeksema's (1993) progressive paradigm, this study recruited 156 college students and measured the frequency of three types of rumination and negative mood (intensity and duration) for 12 consecutive days. The results of daily analysis showed that instrumental rumination was negatively correlated with the degree of negative mood, emotional-focused rumination was positively correlated with the degree of negative mood, and meaning-searching rumination was positively correlated with the duration of negative mood. In addition, when examining the rating within episodes of longer duration or higher severity of negative mood, three types of rumination all showed another effects on negative mood no matter on the duration or severity. Therefore, the present study indicates that different dimensions of rumination have different effects on negative mood fluctuation, and the effect of rumination on emotional adaptation also interacts with the duration and severity of negative mood.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200809-50-3-271-287-a,50.3,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Rumination Predicting Depression and PTSD Symptoms in Postoperative Breast Cancer Patients,"Sheng-Hsiang Yu, Sue-Huei Chen, King-Jen Chang","Rumination, Depression, PTSD, Breast Cancer, Response Style","Life-threatening illness (e.g. cancer) is recognized as a traumatic stressful event. Cancer patients who receive medical treatment may present some notable psychological complaints, such as depressive and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Thus, factors associated with these psychiatric symptoms may play an important role in the adjustment and recovery of the postoperative cancer patients. Empirical researches suggest rumination as a powerful predictor of the maintenance of depressive and PTSD symptoms in response to stress. However, the relationship between rumination and PTSD symptoms in cancer patients has been little understood in the western literature or examined in Taiwan. Therefore, the first purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship among rumination, depression, and PTSD symptoms in postoperative breast cancer patients. This study also sought to examine the ability of rumination in predicting depression and PTSD symptoms. Specifically, ruminative response style was hypothesized to predict depressive and PTSD severity in postoperative cancer patients. In addition, rumination was assumed to have a unique contribution to the prediction of PTSD severity, controlling for current level of depressive severity.
Two hundred and forty four postoperative breast cancer female outpatients recruited from National Taiwan University Hospital volunteered to participate in this study. The measures included the Symptom CheckList-90-Revised short form, Post Traumatic Stress Reaction Index-short form, and Chinese Response Style Questionnaire-short form. The results showed that, as predicted, response style could both significantly predict depression and PTSD severity in postoperative breast cancer patients. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that, after demographical variables and depression severity were controlled, ruminative response style had a unique contribution to the prediction of PTSD severity.
The findings of this study suggest that rumination may play an important role in the development and maintenance of PTSD symptoms in cancer patients. It is speculated that ruminating traumatic experiences may trigger intrusive traumatic memories and affect the cognitive reconstruction of traumatic events. Ruminative responses may also interfere with instrumental behaviors such as seeking care and reducing problem solving ability thus so to result in exacerbation of PTSD. Finally, it will be helpful to replicate this study in patients with different types of cancers. Moreover, future studies can adopt different research paradigms, such as prospective design, to establish the causal relationship of rumination and PTSD symptoms.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200809-50-3-289-302-a,50.3,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Contribution of Social Network Interaction System on Maternal Depression and Acceptance of Cleft Lip and/or Palate Infants: Moderating and Main Effect,"I-Ching Lee, Keng-Ling Lay, Yin-Chang Wu, I-Yuan Liu, Ya-Ping Hsieh","depression, social undermining, cleft lip and/or palate, maternal child rearing attitude, social support","Mothers of cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) infants have to face chronic facial, physical, and psychological problems of their children. The psychological adjustment of those mothers may be both affected and moderated by their social network. The present study adopted a system approach to investigate the moderating (i.e., buffering or exacerbating) and main effect of (1) the positive/negative feature (i.e., social support/undermining), (2) the types (i.e., emotional, informational, and instrumental support/undermining), and (3) the resources (i.e., husband, parents, and parent-in-laws) of social network interaction on maternal depression and acceptance toward CLP infants. Fifty mothers of CLP infants filled up the questionnaire for assessing perceived impact over giving birth to CLP infant while their children were in average two months of age. They then filled up the Beck Depression Inventory (Chinese Version), the Rearing Attitude Questionnaire (Liu & Lay, 2005), and the Social Network Interaction System Questionnaire (Lay & Liu, 1996) following the completion of the first lip-repair surgery (mean age=4.5 months). After controlling for infant gender, maternal educational level, and perceived initial impact, hierarchical regression analyses indicated that maternal perceived social support significantly predict acceptance toward CLP babies (β=.27, p＜.01). Next, even when the variance of social support and its interaction with perceived impact had been controlled, maternal perceived social undermining could still independently predict acceptance and depression (βs=-.21 & .30, ps ＜.05) and the interaction between social undermining and perceived impact could still predict acceptance (β=-.23, p＜.05). These findings not only yielded the main effect of social support but also revealed the main and exacerbating effect of social undermining (Cranford, 2004) on maternal psychological adjustment over and beyond the influence of social support. In addition, the predictability of undermining toward acceptance confirmed the cross-over effect of negative social interaction on positive adjustment index (Newsom, Nishishiba, Morgan, & Rook, 2003). This study also found that emotional and informational support correlates with acceptance (rs=.39 & .30, ps＜.01 & .05), emotional support with depression (r=-.35, p＜.05), emotional and informational undermining with depression (rs=.28 & .35, ps＜.06 & .05), support and undermining from husband with acceptance (rs=.33 & -.33, ps＜.05), and undermining from husband and in-laws with depression (rs=.35, .33, & .41, ps＜.05). Hierarchical regression analyses further indicated that, for those mothers who perceived larger initial impact of giving birth to CLP babies, more instrumental support does not predict increased acceptance. The differential effect of various features, types, and resources of social network on maternal adjustment points to the domain specificity (Finch, 1998) of the social network interaction system. Explicitly, emotional support and undermining as well as instrumental support and undermining play significant roles for maternal adjustment. Meantime, it is suspected that too much instrumental support may deprive maternal sense of control thus hamper adjustment of mothers with high perceived impact. Moreover, that maternal adjustment is more in tune with the support and undermining provided from husband and in-laws may be related to the interaction pattern embedded in Chinese family structure.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200809-50-3-303-326-a,50.3,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The CSAAM argues that when people make agreement/disagreement judgments about a counterpositional communicator's arguments, the responses would be influenced through two routes simultaneously. The first route is a more conscious process. In this route, when the counterpositional communicator's arguments are propositional or strong, an agreement tendency would be elicited. On the contrary, a disagreement tendency would be elicited. The second route is a more automatic process. In this route, the counterpositional message could directly elicit disagreement tendency through emotional reactance. The CSAAM was tested by 3 experiments. Experiment 1 taking 48 high school students as subjects demonstrated that counterpositional message could elicit reactance and a disagreement tendency, and thus influenced agreement/disagreement responses on the communicator's photo. Experiment 2 taking 48 high school students as subjects further supported the influence of counterpositional message is a more automatic one by showing the understanding of counterposition per se could attenuate the influence from conscious processing. Experiment 3 taking 32 high school students as subjects showed argument position and quality could influence argument agreement/disagreement responses, and the influences would co-occur with the automatic influence of counterpositional message.

The Effect of Acoustical Similarity on Lexical-Tone Perception of One-Year-Old Mandarin-Learning Infants,Feng-Ming Tsao,"directional asymmetry, native lexical-tone perception, acoustical similarity of tone, infant speech perception","Speech perception abilities undergo rapid changes around the first birthday, such as developing the language-specific phonetic perception and word segmentation, but only a few studies have examined the development of lexical-tones, an essential phonetic unit to distinguish the meanings of syllables in Mandarin Chinese. This study explored the native tone perception of one-year-old Mandarin-learning infants. Specifically, this study addressed whether the acoustic similarity between lexical tones affected infants' perceptual discrimination performance. Infants (n=109) were tested with the conditioned head-turn procedure when discriminating tone contrasts, Tone 1 vs. 3, 2 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 4, varying in the similarity of average fundamental frequency (F0) and F0 contour. Results showed that infants better discriminated tone contrast with greater acoustical differences (Tone 1 vs. 3), but they were less accurate discriminating acoustically similar tone contrasts (Tone 2 vs. 3 and Tone 2 vs. 4). Directional asymmetry was evident with the Tone 1 vs. 3 contrast, as the change from the background Tone 1 syllable to the target Tone 3 syllable was easier than the reverse. The results suggest that auditory processing is the essential mechanism for one-year-old infants to perceive native lexical tones, and that the perceptual mechanism for lexical tone in infants differs from Mandarin-speaking adults.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200806-50-2-111-124-a,50.2,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Impact of Implicit and Explicit Factors on the Performance of Creativity Tasks,"Fa-Chung Chiu, Hsueh-Chih Chen, Chih-Chun Hsu, Hsiang-Yi Wu, Shu-Ling Cho","positive and negative emotion, subjective standard, temporal perspective, creative strategies, implicit and explicit processes","This study was intended to investigate the implicit and explicit manipulations to creativity by adopting double dissociation approach. It is assumed that the existence of different underlying cognitive processes of creativity in nature could be reflected in use of mutually exclusive tasks based on observed contrasting behavioral patterns. Four experiments are reported on exploring the hypothesis that creativity is consisted of independent implicit and explicit components, which can be tested by manipulating specific implicit and explicit variables. In Experiments 1 and 2, ”temporal perspective” and ”positive and negative emotion” were examined as implicit factors for the influence to target creativity tasks, respectively. ”Temporal perspective” was referred to asking participants to image the life in the near future (e.g., tomorrow) or the farther future (one or two years later) and ”positive and negative emotion” was participants' emotional status induced by seeing clips. On the other hand, for investigating the impact of explicit factors on the same tasks, participants in Experiment 3 encountered explicit factors ”subjective standard” (the instruction to encourage higher performance or not) but ”creative strategy instruction” (two specific types of strategies were given) in Experiment 4. The results show that both ”temporal perspective” and ”positive and negative emotion” only altered the performance of the implicit task (insight problems) and the fluency, flexibility, and originality in the implicit-explicit hybrid divergent thinking task but not the elaboration in the pure explicit task. To the contrary, for the same tasks, explicit factors, ”subjective standard” and ”creative strategy instruction”, were found to impact the fluency, flexibility, and originality of the implicit-explicit hybrid task instead of the pure implicit task. These findings demonstrate that particular implicit variables are mainly related to implicit creativity tasks and explicit factors are largely associated with explicit creativity tasks.

A Three-Month Prospective Investigation of Negative Cognitions in Predicting Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms: The Mediating Role of Traumatic Memory Quality,"Yi-Jen Su, Sue-Huei Chen","posttrauma cognitions, PTSD, traumatic memory, PTCI","Recently, several studies have indicated that trauma survivors may adopt an extreme view about dangerousness of the world and lack ability to cope with threat and stress after the trauma, thus raise their risk of chronic PTSD. Other theories have postulated that quality and nature of trauma memories may relate to the presence of pathological stress reactions. The failure to integrate traumatic memories may impart its potential to cause posttraumatic stress disorders. Traumatic memories, as a kind of cognitive representation, appears to be more related to the core symptoms of PTSD (e.g., intrusive symptoms) at psychopathological level. Hence, it may serve as a mediator between posttrauma negative beliefs and subsequent PTSD. By integrating these two lines of research findings, the present study attempted to address a framework that links negative beliefs, traumatic memory, and PTSD and investigate their associations.
Participants included 61 college students who had experienced at least one traumatic event that satisfied DSM-IV PTSD criteria A. They were administered the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS), Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), and Depressive Subscale of Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) at Time 1 (T1). Modified Traumatic Memory Inventory with the same above-mentioned protocol was given again at follow-up assessment 3 months after the initial assessment (T).
Results indicated that 1) PTSD symptoms at T2 could be predicted by negative self and world beliefs but not self-blame thinking at T1, after controlling for gender, age, as well as PTSD and depressive symptoms at T1; 2) Reexperiencing symptoms at T2 could be predicted by negative self and world beliefs at T1, and the predictive effect of negative self belief at T1 was higher than the other beliefs at T1. Avoidance symptoms at T2 could be predicted by negative world beliefs at T1, and the predictive effect of negative world belief at T1 that merely reached marginally significant level was higher than the other beliefs at T1; 3) PTSD symptom at T2 could be accounted for by concurrent overwhelming traumatic memory, after controlling for gender, age, as well as PTSD and depressive symptoms at T1. However, the remaining variables of trauma memory did not account for significant variance; 4) by using path analysis; we found that overwhelming traumatic memory at T2 mediated the relation between negative self and world beliefs at T1 and subsequent PTSD symptoms at T2.
Overall, it was demonstrated that posttrauma negative beliefs and traumatic memory quality may contribute to the maintenance of PTSD symptoms. These findings are parallel to recent cognitive theories of PTSD.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200806-50-2-167-186-a,50.2,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"The Clinical Applicability of the Arithmetic, Digit Span Subtests of the Taiwan WAIS-Ⅲ, and Their Composite in Reflecting the Working Memory Index: A Retrospective Study","Wei-Han Wang, Mau-Sun Hua, Chi-Cheng Yang, Yi-Chuan Chu, Ting-Wen Cheng, Ping-Keung Yip, Ming-Chang Chiu, Ta-Fu Chen, Sheng-Jean Huang, Hsien-Tsung Chen, We","digit span, working memory, arithmetic","There are many issues in regards to whether or not the composite of Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests used to determine the working memory index of the Taiwan WAIS-Ⅲ is compatible with that of the English WAIS-Ⅲ, and whether the individual Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests, and the span scores of the Digit Span subtest are adequate for measuring working memory. This study was thus to make an attempt to examine these issues.
In this retrospective study, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were employed, using brain imaging data of 179 patients with various CNS diseases as the gold standard, to identify the working-memory-related scores in the Taiwan WAIS-Ⅲ. The results, as estimated by a composite of the Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests, revealed all the specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value of the Taiwan WAIS-Ⅲ working memory index were each at or above 94%, yet the sensitivity was only 63%. The sensitivities of the Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests were even poorer, measuring only 50%. However, the positive predictive value of the Digit Span subtest was 86% while the Arithmetic subtest was 67%. In addition, the forward and backward span scores of the Digit Span subtest had good negative predictive value (all of them were above 92%), but poor sensitivity (all of them were below 58%).
Based on the present findings, it appears that all the Taiwan WAIS-Ⅲ working memory index, the single Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests, and the span scores of the Digit Span subtest could adequately discriminate individuals without working memory impairment, but had poor sensitivity on detecting the patients who evidenced working memory impairment. Accordingly, it is suggested that clinicians should gauge the working memory index by a composite of the Arithmetic, the Digit Span, and the Letter-Number Sequencing subtests if possible. Otherwise, a caveat should be taken with care to interpret the working memory index, as estimated by a composite of the Arithmetic and the Digit Span subtests, because the chance of the increasing false negative rate becomes ineludible. Respecting the limitations of retrospective study, however, it is necessary to make a prospective study to re-approach this issue.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200806-50-2-187-199-a,50.2,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Past research has shown that subordinates' justice perception mediates the relationship between abusive supervision and emotional exhaustion. In this study, I further hypothesize that emotional labor serves as another mediator. In addition, I investigate how the moderating role of perceived supervisory power plays on the relationship between abusive supervision and the two mediators (justice perception and emotional labor).
Two hundred and twenty three valid questionnaires were collected from full-time employees in Taiwan using survey research techniques. The results show that, after controlling altogether the respondents' gender, tenure, rank, education, gender combination, length of working years, and negative affectivity, abusive supervision predicts emotional exhaustion not only through subordinates' justice perception, but also through subordinates' emotional labor. In addition, subordinates' perception of supervisory power is found to moderate the relationship between abusive supervision and emotional labor, but not the relationship between abusive supervision and justice perception. Finally, abusive supervision is found to be more strongly related to emotional labor when individuals perceive more supervisory power.

The Timing Isochrony of Spoken Mandarin at Different Speaking Rates,Jing-Yi Jeng,"speech timing, perceptual center, isochrony, rhythm, pairwise variation index PVI","The behavior of speech timing plays an important role in the process of speech perception and production. The source of speech rhythm is based on the ”isochrony”. Isochrony unit is a hypothetical unit which has an equal duration interval existing in the speech stream. The users of a language base on the isochrony unit to process the speech information during speech process. The purpose of this study is to investigate two candidates of speech timing units in connected Mandarin. The first candidate is ”the whole syllables unit (pause/gap+CV)” and the other is ”the rime onset unit (rime+pause/gap+C)”. This study consists of three experiments; the first two experiments are production tasks, and the third is a perceptual task. In the first experiment, 30 mandarin speakers read 33 sets of Chinese phrases and sentences and two passages at five speaking rates by using a metronome to modulate the speaking rates. Segmental durations were obtained via acoustic analysis, and then, the pairwise variation index (PVI) was computed for the two candidate units to compare the degree of isochrony. The results show that the rime onset unit had significantly less PVI value than the whole syllable unit, and the two kinds of units had the maximum difference at the slow speaking rates, but at the fast speaking rates there was no difference between them. The second experiment is the replicate of the first one, and the major difference is the method of speaking rate control. The second experiment had similar results as the first one, again, the rime onset unit had the less PVI. In the third experiment, 18 listeners estimated the degree of naturalness of 24 sentences with different PVI values. The results show that the degree of naturalness is highly correlated with PVI values; moreover, for the PVI calculated by the rime onset unit, the correlation is stronger than that by whole syllable unit. These findings support the rime onset unit is the isochrony unit in speech timing process of Mandarin. The results suggest the basic unit of Mandarin speech timing is related with rime onset, where is also known as the locus of ”perceptual center”.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200803-50-1-1-19-a,50.1,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
A Generalized Publication Bias Model,"Peter H. Schonemann, Jeffrey D. Scargle","meta-analysis, publication bias, file-drawer hypothesis, fail-safe number","Scargle (2000) has discussed Rosenthal and Rubin's (1978) fail-safe number” (FSN) method for estimating the number of unpublished studies in meta-analysis. He concluded that this FSN cannot possibly be correct because a central assumption the authors used conflicts with the very definition of publication bias. While this point has been made by others before (Darlington, 1980; Elsahoff, 1978; lyengar & Greenhouse, 1988; Thomas, 1985), Scargle showed, by way of a simple 2-parameter model, how far off Rosenthal and Rubin's estimate can be in practice. However, his results relied on the assumption that the decision variable is normally distributed with zero mean. In this case the ratio of unpublished to published papers is large only in a tiny region of the parameter plane. Building on these results, we now show that (1) replacing densities with probability masses greatly simplifies Scargle's derivations and permits an explicit statement of the relation between the probability a of Type I errors and the step-size β; (2) this result does not require any distribution assumptions; (3) the distinction between 1-sided and 2-sided rejection regions becomes immaterial; (4) this distribution-free approach leads to an immediate generalization to partitions involving more than two intervals, and thus covers more general selection functions.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200803-50-1-21-29-a,50.1,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Study 1 used open-ended questionnaire to collect interpersonal helping events. The results indicated that the events in which people would ask family members or acquaintances to help were nothing to do with the concept of ”face”. On the other hand, the events in which participants would not ask the familiar to help were related to issues of privacy and/or face-threatening. With regards to the reasons why not ask for help from the familiar were mainly consideration not willing to make the familiar worry. On the contrary, the subjects would attribute why their friends would not ask for helps from the familiar to reasons of face-saving though the events were very similar.
Using the events and the attributed reasons for ask and not ask for helping collected from study 1, study 2 and 3 adopted scenario experimental method and manipulated the conditions of favor-request to threaten one's social face (study 2) and moral face (study 3). Both results of study 2 and 3 showed that when the favor-request condition was not ”face-threatening”, most participants chose the members of their family (expressive ties) to help, and the reason for their choice was for ”better help”. Instead, when the condition was ”face-threatening”, participants chose to ask help from strangers (instrumental ties), and the reason for their choice was for ”face-saving”.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200803-50-1-31-48-a,50.1,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Children's Vulnerability and Inflammability to Peer Verbal Provocation: Sociometric and Developmental Differences,"Pei-Chen Yeh, Keng-Ling Lay","peer relationship, inflammability, proactive aggression, reactive aggression, vulnerability","When children enter middle childhood, mode of aggression becomes increasingly less physical. Instead, verbal aggression occurs frequently in peer interaction of elementary school students. The purpose of this research is to investigate, during middle and late childhood, the age, sex, and individual differences of the vulnerability and inflammability in response to peer verbal aggression delivered either by liked or disliked classmates. Vulnerability is measured by children's fear and self-blame in response to peer provocation. Inflammability is measured by children's anger and hostility attributions. Whitesell and Harter (1996) indicated that children respond with more intense and prolonged negative emotion if conflict situations involve best friends. Fabes, Eisenberg, Smith, and Murphy (1996), by contrast, demonstrated that children's responses to provocations by well liked peers are more controlled than is the case for anger provoked by peers who are not well liked. The first goal of this study thus is to compare children's response to verbal provocation enacted by liked versus disliked classmates. Selman and Byrne (1974) suggested that, from middle to late childhood, children move from being incapable of integrating self and other's perspectives to simultaneously considering mutual roles during interactions. Crick, Grotpeter, and Bigbee (2002) as well as Underwood, Coie, and Herbsman (1992) and Underwood, Hurley, Johanson, and Mosley (1999) suggested that older children are better at regulating their anger and distress. That is, older children are better both at understanding other's perspective and regulating one's own emotion. The second goal of this study thus is to test the hypothesis of milder vulnerability and inflammability for older children in response to peer verbal aggression. Previous research on the Social Information Processing (SIP) of proactive aggressors, reactive aggressors, and victimized children suggested that each type of children may react to peer conflict with different encoding, interpretation, response evaluation, and response enactment. Accordingly, the third goal of this study is to examine whether children with high reactive aggression tendency are more likely to be inflamed by both negative and neutral peer verbal provocation (Dodge & Coie, 1987; Crick & Dodge, 1996); whether those with high proactive aggression tendency, because of their emotional-callous traits (Frick et al., 2003; Kimonis et al., 2006), are less vulnerable and inflammable to verbal provocation; and whether those with high victimization tendency are more vulnerable and less inflammable while facing peer verbal provocation (Finnegan, Hodges, & Perry, 1998; Schwartz, Chang, & Farver, 2001).
Eleven classes of fourth graders (189 males and 166 females) and eleven classes of sixth graders (190 males and 175 females) from the Metropolitan Taipei area participated in the two-stage study. During the first stage of data collection, information about each subject's liked and disliked classmates and the proactive aggressors, reactive aggressors, and victims in the class was collected through sociometrics. Results revealed that those who scored lower on social preference and those who scored higher on social impact were more likely to be nominated as proactive aggressors, reactive aggressors, or victims of aggression (all ps＜.01). During the second stage of data collection, each subject read hypothetical scenarios about receiving verbal aggressions and neutral verbal stimuli from the particular liked or disliked classmates that the child had nominated during the first stage. Subjects were to rate their fear, self-blame, anger, and hostility attribution in response to the scenarios. Concordant with Whitesell and Harter (1996), results demonstrated that fourth graders revealed higher vulnerability in response to negative verbal provocation delivered by liked as opposed to disliked peers (effect of ”liked vs. disliked peer x age” interaction on vulnerability: F(1, 499)=10.84, p＜.01). Contrary to Whitesell and Harter (1996), but concordant with Fabes et al. (1996), verbal aggression from disliked peers resulted in higher inflammability, F(1, 499)=371.57, p＜.001. Sixth graders were less inflammable to verbal aggression than their fourth grade counterparts, F(1, 499)=10.02, p＜.01. No sex differences were found in sixth graders' inflammability, but fourth grade boys' inflammability was significantly higher than girls, F(1, 499)=6.90, p＜.01. The above results indicate the development of children's emotional regulation and social information processing from the fourth to the sixth grade especially in boys.
Children with high proactive-aggression tendency experienced lower vulnerability, F(1, 162)=14.89, p＜.01, and children with high victimization tendency experienced higher vulnerability F(1, 166)=8.11, p＜.01. upon being verbally provoked by peers, In addition, children with high victimization tendency responded to liked versus disliked peers' negative verbal provocation with less differentiated level of inflammability as compared with the non-victimized children (the effect of ”liked vs. disliked peers x victimization” interaction on inflammability : F(1, 166)=14.61, p＜.01). Contrary to the original hypothesis, children with high reactive-aggression tendency did not show higher inflammability in response to peer verbal aggression. The methodological and theoretical implications of the present findings were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200803-50-1-49-69-a,50.1,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Response Evaluation and Emotional Experiences of Indirect Aggression: Findings from Children during Early Adolescence in a Culturally Chinese Context,"Ming-Chuan Wang, Keng-Ling Lay","peer relationship, relational aggression, indirect aggression, social information-processing, peer status","Although the understanding of indirect aggression has been significantly advanced in recent years, past research still suffers from a few limitations. Firstly, data should be collected through methods other than questionnaires that dominate the recent findings. Secondly, research has yet to further clarify the processes that lead to the emotions and the response evaluation while being victimized by indirect aggression in peer context. Thirdly, most prior studies focused on children in middle childhood, leaving the effect of indirect aggression on children during early adolescence less explored. Finally, the vast majority of research has been conducted in Western cultural contexts, which may conceive the meaning of indirect aggression differently from culturally Chinese societies. Therefore, the specific goal of this research was to examine the response evaluation and the emotional reactions to victimization of indirect aggression among culturally Chinese children at the stage of early adolescence by means of a newly developed structured interview with card-sorting procedures. The interaction effect between gender and peer status on the response evaluation was also of interest according to the effect-to-danger ratio hypothesis.
Fifty-six children nominated by their head teachers as popular or rejected (mean age=11.60 years) participated in Study 1. During the interview, a vignette depicting indirect aggression was visually and auditorily presented, and then a series of questions concerning personal experiences, including emotional reactions, were presented. Subjects' evaluation on the effectiveness of various kinds of indirect aggression strategies was then probed through a deck of 15 cards each stating a strategy of indirect aggression. Results showed that the gender by peer status interaction on response evaluation was not significant. However, rejected children enumerated marginally more indirect aggression strategies as effective than their popular counterparts. Study 1 also confirmed the effect-to-danger ratio hypothesis and showed that girls felt more troubled and sad than did boys in response to indirect aggression, while degree of anger revealed no gender differences.
Sixty children nominated by same-gender same-class peers as popular or rejected (mean age 13.98 years) participated in Study 2, where the interview procedure was similar to Study 1 except for minor modifications. The number of indirect aggression strategies that popular and rejected subjects enumerated as effective was not different. Next, to take the statistical power issue into account, data from Study 1 and Study 2 were pooled. Results indicated that rejected subjects enumerated more indirect aggression strategies as effectively than their popular counterparts. Further, Study 2 found a significant interaction effect of peer status and gender on response evaluation. Compared with popular boys, rejected boys were more likely to adopt indirect aggression strategies to cope with indirect aggression. By contrast, rejected girls did not favor indirect aggression strategies more than popular girls. As for emotional reactions to victimization by indirect aggression, Study 2 replicated the findings in Study 1 that confirmed the effect-to-danger ratio hypothesis.
Study 3 attempted to further validate the structured interview by comparing the responses between children designated through peer estimation technique as either highly or less indirect-aggressive and 72 children (mean age=12.08 years) were recruited. Results indicated those who were highly indirect-aggressive did not enumerate more indirect aggression strategies as effectively than did the less aggressive counterparts. Further, the interaction effect of peer- estimated indirect aggression tendency and gender was not significant. It is suspected that the highly indirect-aggressive children might be heifer or at least not worse at social intelligence, which had buffered them from displaying biases or deficiencies in social information processing. Study 3, again, replicated the findings in Study 1 and Study 2 that girls were more troubled and sad than boys but felt similar degree of anger compared to boys while being victimized by indirect aggression. Findings from the above studies were discussed based on both the social information-processing model and the effect-to-danger ratio hypothesis. The incompatible results among the three studies were discussed according to a developmental perspective.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200803-50-1-71-90-a,50.1,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Selection of Factor-Based WAIS-Ⅲ Tetrads in the Taiwan Standardization Sample: A Guide to Clinical Practice,"Hsin-Yi Chen, Mau-Sun Hua, Jian-Jun Zhu, Yung-Hwa Chen","Taiwan norm, short form","Factor-based WAIS-Ⅲ tetrads were investigated with the Taiwan WAIS-Ⅲ standardization sample of 888 normal adults, ages 16 to 84 years old. Various psychometric characteristics, time constraints, as well as qualities of estimation among prorating and linear equating procedures, were compared among 54 tetrads. Our results supported the use of the linear equating procedure. The Similarities-Matrix Reasoning-Arithmetic-Digit Symbol form exceeded others with respect to validity, content representation, and time saving. Kaufman's (1990) Similarities-Picture Completion-Arithmetic-Digit Symbol combination, and the Information-Picture Completion-Arithmetic-Digit Symbol short forms were both among the most efficient estimations. For clinicians who highly value the clinical information of Block Design, two other forms, Similarities-Block Design-Arithmetic-Digit Symbol and Information-Block Design-Arithmetic-Digit Symbol, were found providing better estimation quality. Nonetheless, current findings revealed that even preferred tetrads had substantial misclassification rates, and these factor-based tetrads tend to show under-estimation for people with top abilities. Users are cautioned to use these short forms for screening purposes only. Results of this study are consistent with literature and assist in choosing among WAIS-Ⅲ factor-based tetrads by providing their relative psychometric quality.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200803-50-1-91-109-a,50.1,2008,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Chinese Readers' Knowledge of How Chinese Orthography Represents Phonology,"Ming Lo, Chih-Wei Hue, Fang-Zhi Tsai","Chinese Character, Statistical model of language learning, Phonetic awareness, Meta-linguistic awareness, Character pronunciation","Phonetic awareness refers to a Chinese reader's knowledge of the principles governing the orthography-phonology relationships in Chinese characters (Shu, Anderson, & Wu, 2000). Shu et al. suggested that a phonetically aware reader can infer the pronunciation of an unknown character from its constituent components. In particular, they observed that a Chinese reader uses the right component of a left-and-right arranged two-component character to infer the character's pronunciation. However, analysis of seven character groups used by elementary school students and adults showed that in a left-and-right arranged two-component character, both components may provide cues to its pronunciation. The analysis also found that certain simple characters have higher validity in representing phonology than others. According to the statistical model of language learning proposed by Saffran, Aslin and Newport (1996), a learner can acquire an understanding of the statistical statistical nature of linguistic input through repetitive use of the language. For Chinese characters, the mapping of orthography to phonology is imperfect and probabilistic. Thus, according to the statistical learning model, a Chinese reader needs to understand the statistical nature of the mapping between the pronunciation of a character and its components. We tested this assumption in two experiments. The participants in the first experiment were second-, fourth-, and sixth-graders. Their vocabulary sizes were assessed, and their guesses about the pronunciation of a group of pseudo-characters composed of two left-and-right arranged components were recorded. The experiment results indicate the following. (1) The so-called ”position strategy” is an oversimplification of how a Chinese reader uses a character's components to infer the character's pronunciation. (2) A Chinese reader knows which simple characters are more likely to represent the phonology. (3) A Chinese reader knows the probabilities that the various components of a character represent the phonology. That is, the reader knows that the right component is more likely to provide cues to the character's pronunciation than the left component. (4) As a Chinese reader's vocabulary increases, the way he/she uses a character's components to infer the character's pronunciation may best be described as the so called ”position strategy”. In the second experiment, the concept of the ”position strategy” was tested further and verified, using college students as the participants.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200712-49-4-315-334-a,49.4,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The Effects of Acute Stress on Conditioned Place Preference,"Ying-Ling Shen, Ruey-Ming Liao","elevated stand stressor, temporal sequence of conditioning, stress intensity, acquisition, restrain stressor, conditioned behavior","Physiological and behavioral functions could be affected when the individual is under stress. Previous studies accumulate a more consistent evidence for the relationship between stress and physiological function. In contrast, the relationship between stress and behavioral function remains debatable due to inconsistent findings reported in the past. Presumably, multiple factors are involved in mediating behavioral functions altered by the stress. By the use of two types of stressors (elevated stand and restraint), the present study manipulated the intensities of stressor and the temporal sequences to pair the stressor with contextual environment on the acquisition of conditioned place preference. Experiment 1 manipulated different durations (10, 30, or 60 min) of stressor conducted before the beginning of conditioning session. The results showed that the conditioned place preference was significantly formed by only the subjects received 30 min stressor treatment, and such effect was true for either elevated stand or restraint stressor. Experiment 2 evaluated the effects of 30 min stressor presented immediately before, during, or right after the conditioning session of the present task. As the results showed, the conditioned place preference was formed by the stressor (elevated stand or restraint) presented immediately before placing the subject into the association context, rather than conducted afterward. Such effect was also true for the restrain stressor presented during the conditioning session. Together, it was found that conditioned place preference could be acquired by the optimal intensity of the stressor and at certain temporal sequences of stressor presented to the subject for pairing with the environmental context. These data indicate that the type and intensity of acute stressor as well as its temporal sequence of conditioning can be critically important for the stressor to be an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) in the classical conditioning.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200712-49-4-351-363-a,49.4,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The present study was thus made an attempt to explore these issues in questionably and mildly demented patients with AD. A total of 90 adult participants including, 30 questionably and 30 mildly demented patients with AD, and 30 normal healthy controls participated in this study. Each subject received a recall-judgment-recognition (RJR) paradigm task and a battery of neuropsychological tests, mainly including memory and executive function measures. The results revealed that both questionably and mildly demented patients' performance on the FOK judgment task was significantly poorer than that of normal control counterparts, and these demented patients evidenced deficits of executive function other than memory impairment. Most of the demented patients with defective function of FOK also manifested impairments of memory and executive function. These results partially confirm findings evident in the literature, and we further suggest that deficits of both memory and executive function might account for the impairment of FOK in our demented patients.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200712-49-4-365-382-a,49.4,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Multilevel Latent Variable Modeling of Contextual Variables: Application of Multilevel Structural Equation Modeling on Rater Effects,Haw-Jeng Chiou,"contextual variables, multilevel data, latent contextual variables, rater effects, multilevel structural equation modeling","The estimation of latent construct is the core issue of social and behavioral science. Structural equation modeling is the most important paradigm for estimation and for exploring the relationships among constructs. If the data for analysis involving multilevel or clustered structure, however, the multilevel SEM have to be applied for the special form of dataset. One of the features of multilevel data is that the observed variables in the individual level could be aggregated as a contextual variable into higher level. In terms of latent construct, contextual variable may behave as a latent form and should be estimated in a way of factorial analysis instead of manifest procedure. In a circumstance that the latent contextual variables have significant effects on dependent variable is called latent contextual effects. The purpose of present paper is to clarify the significance of the latent contextual effects in the social research. Rating data of oral examination examined in the present study contains a total of 76 raters and 841 interviewees. A series of single and multiple level SEM models was proposed for examining the latent contextual effects. Results of Mplus indicated that the MSEM modeling can effectively extract the latent contextual variables and furthermore used to explain the dependent variables. Different factorial structure on latent contextual variables in both macro and micro level reveals that the contextual model is not equivalent across levels. The present study proved that the MSEM approach to examine contextual variables is more flexibility than traditional MLM paradigm.

Chinese Loyalty to Supervisor: Construct Analysis and Scale Development,"Ding-Yu Jiang, Bor-Shuian Cheng, Chi-Ying Cheng, Li-Fang Zhou","and Chinese organizational behavior, Loyalty to supervisor, reliability and validity, and Chinese organizational behavior reliability and validity, Chinese Loyalty to Supervisor Scale","Loyalty to supervisor is a prevalent but under-investigated phenomenon in Chinese organizations. One plausible reason for this is the lack of a reliable and valid measure of loyalty in the Chinese context. This study aims to develop a valid measure of Chinese loyalty to supervisor. In Study 1, we identify a four-dimension construct of loyalty to supervisor that consists of 11 sub-dimensions (factors) on the basis of loyalty literature. The four dimensions are: identification with supervisor, task assistance, obedience, and sacrifice for supervisor. In Study 2, a 40-item Chinese loyalty to supervisor scale was developed and examined by three independent samples. The results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the 11-factor, 40-item scale could be reduced to a 6-factor, 21-item scale. The six factors are: identification with supervisor, internalization of the supervisor's values, initiative accommodation, task assistance, obedience, and sacrifice for supervisor. Results of reliability analyses indicated that the Chinese loyalty to supervisor scale is reliable and stable over time. Evidence that supports the criterion-related validity of Chinese loyalty to supervisor scale shows that Chinese loyalty to supervisor significantly associates with paternalistic leadership, job performance, extra-role performance, and supervisor trust in subordinate.

The main purpose of the research is to explore the difference in paternalistic leadership performed by the female and male supervisors when facing the subordinate with different sexes, and to examine the moderating effect of length of cowork on the relationship between sex combinations of subordinate-supervisor and paternalistic leadership. The data were collected by the questionnaire survey on 510 supervisor-subordinate dyads from 60 companies in Taiwan. The result shows that there is no significant difference in paternalistic leadership between the female and male supervisors. However, considering the weight of subordinate's sex, sex combinations of supervisor-subordinate do have the prevailing influence on authoritarianism and benevolent leadership but on moral leadership. Moreover, the effect of sex combinations of supervisor-subordinate on authoritarianism leadership are moderated by the time period that the supervisor worked with the subordinate.

M Shape vs. Bell Shape: The Ideology of National Identity and Its Psychological Basis in Taiwan,Li-Li Huang,"social dominant orientation, national identity, collective self-identity, right-wing authoritarian, collective consciousness","According to Huang, Liu and Chang (2004), national identity in Taiwan is facing a dilemma of double identity, as both Taiwanese identity and Chinese identity are viable. This predicament has deep historical roots, but controversies between political and cultural aspects of identity have been increasing. In order to know more about the substance of double identity and its psychological basis, the present follow up research treated national identity as an awakening national consciousness. Collective self-esteem (affective component) and identity consciousness (cognitive component) combined with imagination of future nationhood (behavioral tendency) to form an ideology of national identity, which was measured using Likert-style items and entered into a discriminant analysis against categorical measures of national identity.
1368 adult participants from all regions in Taiwan completed a self-report questionnaire in 2003. An indigenous revised scale of collective self-esteem measured affective aspects of identity, and forty new items about identity consciousness were developed. The results of factor analysis indicated that national identity consciousness consisted of four sets of beliefs: ”Greater Chinese consciousness”, ”Kuomingtang (KMT) legitimacy”, ”separation consciousness”, and ”Taiwanese refinement”. Whether participants supported reunification or independence served as the measure of imagined future nationhood. A categorical measure divided participants into three national identities based on forced choice survey responses: ”Chinese First”, ”Taiwanese First”, and ”Taiwanese Only”. These three kinds of national identity were regarded as dependent variables for the ideology of national identity. In addition, personality scales such as ”social dominance orientation”, ”right-wing authoritarian personality” were regarded as antecedent factors of the ideology of national identity.
Results demonstrated that people with three types of national identity showed significant differences on four sets of national identity consciousness, collective selfesteem, future imagination and other relevant variables. Discriminant analysis was used to provide a multivariate of analysis of the three types of national identity, and results indicated that ”Taiwanese refinement” and ”Taiwanese self-esteem” were in the middle of ideology and most people agreed with them, ”separation consciousness” combined with ”support for independence” on the one pole; and ”Greater Chinese consciousness” ”KMT legitimacy” and ”support for unification” were on the other opposite pole of ideology. In other words, the distribution of the ideology of national identity was bell shaped but political party support was double peaks M shaped. Finally, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to model the influences of psychological factors on the ideology of national identity, and the indicated that the three types of categorical national identity had different psychological bases.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200712-49-4-451-470-a,49.4,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Target aircraft were distinguished by an airspace course that conflicted with Ownship (the participant's aircraft). Of primary interest was the influence of brightness highlighting on participants' ability to detect the target aircraft among distractor aircraft. The display could present all (homogenous) bright aircraft, all (homogenous) dim aircraft, or mixed bright and dim aircraft, with the target aircraft being either bright or dim. In the mixed intensity display, participants were not instructed whether the target aircraft was bright or dim. The first experiment measuring participants' response time showed that instead of bright targets being detected faster, dim targets were detected more slowly in the mixed intensity display than in the homogenous display. The second experiment utilized Signal Detection methodology to determine the cause of this effect. The signal detectability measure, A'(a non-parametric variant of d'), revealed that targets presented at the dim intensity in the mixed intensity display yielded significantly lower sensitivity than either of the homogenous displays or the bright targets in the mixed intensity display. There was not a significant difference in False Alarm rates between any displays, indicating no change in decision criterion.

When evaluating how well a theory can account for the phenomenon of interest, modeling is a powerful research tool. However, local (Taiwanese) psychology students have limited exposure to what cognitive modeling is, how to do implement cognitive models, and why cognitive modelling is important. This is partly due to a lack of university courses that teach cognitive modelling and partly due to the demands that modelling places on one's skills. The purpose of this article is to provide a conceptual guideline of how to do modeling, by fitting two neural network models-ALCOVE and ATRIUM to the data from the study of Yang and Lewandowsky (2003), which tested the theoretical concept of knowledge partitioning in categorization.

Making Connections with Metaphors: Does Conventionality Matter?,David Allbritton,"metaphor, text comprehension, schemas, conceptual metaphor","Previous research on the effects of metaphor on text comprehension provided evidence that conceptual metaphors can connect parts of a text representation, as evidenced by priming in word and sentence recognition tests. This study extended the previous findings with a different priming methodology, and investigated whether forming connections depends on the conventionality (familiarity) of the metaphors used. Although the effects of metaphorical consistency were not robust (significant priming effects were evident only after post-hoc filtering of the data to remove subjects who did not attend to the task), both novel and conventional metaphors were found to produce priming for metaphor-related words and sentences, suggesting that conventionality was not necessary for the metaphors to make connections.

The effects of adjustments in rounding and truncating and the gaps resulting from the score conversions were evaluated. Also, the impact on the admission decisions was investigated. The findings indicated that for all transformation procedures, the results produced by using the real and simulated data were similar for the most part. For all tests and years, employing the arcsine transformation stabilized the error variability along much of the entire scale. But, the linear transformation yielded the most satisfactory results regarding the size of the gaps, the normalizing approach created similar distributional characteristics among the tests, and the log-odds transformation produced the smallest values of the average error variance overall.

(2002) and compared attentional capture by red distractor (i.e., contingent on the target-defining feature) and onset distractor (i.e., not contingent on the target-defining feature), using the RSVP paradigm (Experiment 1) and the spatial cueing paradigm (Experiment 2 and 3). Results showed that, regardless of which paradigm is used, attentional capture occurs only by the red distractor but not by the onset distractor, suggesting that the different results obtained in previous studies were not caused by different paradigms used. Outside focal attention a salient stimulus that is contingent on the target-defining feature has the highest possibility to capture attention.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200706-49-2-145-158-a,49.2,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Applying the Situational Interview Approach in Measuring Practical Intelligence of Preschool Teachers,"Hsing-Ming Lee, Mi-Tao Chen","practical intelligence, confirmatory factor analysis, video-based situational interview, structural equation modeling","The main purpose of the present study was to video-based situational interview approach to measure preschool teacher's practical intelligence. Face to face questionnaire survey was conducted with preschool teachers from Taiwain aera. 1200 preschool teachers was sampled by the way of two-stage sampling. According to the item analysis, exploratory analyses, video-based situational interview for preschool teacher's practical intelligence is reduced to 12 items. Confirmatory factor analysis of nested factor structure show that measurement of video-based situational interview for preschool teachers' practical intelligence include general and specific factors. Specific factors are adaptive, shaping, and selective situation, general factor is practical intelligence (GP). And the amount of specific variance is more than GP. The validity of evaluating indicators for preschool teacher's practical intelligence is investigated through the construction of a multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) matrix. The three sections of the indicators, including adaptive, shaping, and selective situation, are treated as distinct traits. While, video-based situational interview and situational judgment inventory are treated as distinct methods. Results from MTMM matrix provide support for the convergent validity, discriminant validity of the indicators. The result of structural equation modeling indicate that job performance of preschool teachers can be captured by video-based situational interview. Those findings will give helpful information to apply video-based situational interview and future study.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200706-49-2-159-183-a,49.2,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Forms and Functions of Wisdom in Real-life Contexts,Shih-Ying Yang,"Taiwanese Chinese, process, real-life context, embodiment, good life, positive influences, everyday cognition, integration, Wisdom","The present study defines wisdom as a process which emerges after a person has successfully implemented his or her integrated idea to a real-life context and exerted positive influences through his or her action. After asserting that wisdom can only be observed in real-life contexts through real persons' endeavor, the present study aims to investigate wisdom through semi-structured interviews with 66 wisdom nominees nominated by 80 nominators of diverse backgrounds. Analysis of the interview transcripts yielded 220 wisdom incidents that fall into five categories. Thus, wisdom emerges in real life when one (1) strives for common good by helping others and contributing to society, (2) achieves and maintains a satisfactory state of life, (3) decides and develops life paths, (4) resolves difficult problems at work, (5) insists on doing the right things when facing adversity. The present findings support the process view of wisdom which encompasses three core components: integration, action taken to embody one’s visions for a good life, and the resulting positive effects.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200706-49-2-185-204-a,49.2,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Indirect Aggression during Early Adolescence: Construct Validity of Peer Estimation Technique,"Ming-Chuan Wang, Keng-Ling Lay","peer estimation technique, social aggression, relational aggression, indirect aggression, peer relationships","This research dealt with three issues related to the construct validity of peer-estimated indirect aggression during early adolescence. The first issue involves whether the construct of indirect aggression is a first-order factor or a second-order factor. The second issue involves the relations between sociometric status and the frequency of indirect aggressive behaviors. The third issue involves whether indirect aggression is more frequently found in girls or boys, or there is no gender difference. Therefore, the specific aims of this study were threefold. The first one was to examine the nature and factor structure of young adolescents' peer-estimated indirect aggression. The second one was to investigate how peer-estimated indirect aggression in young adolescents is related to sociometric status. The third one was to analyze gender differences of indirect aggression in different age groups. A total of 1111 sixth graders (N=596) and eighth graders (N=515) from 18 schools in Taiwan completed a peer nomination procedure for assessing sociometric status and a peer estimation procedure for assessing the frequency of indirect aggression. Two competing models of confirmatory factor analyses including a first order one- factor model and a second order three-factor model were proposed.
Results indicated that the second order three- factor model fits the observed data better than the single factor model. This hierarchical CFA model implies that the higher-order factor, indirect aggression, has a direct causal effect on the lower-order factors, including relationship manipulation, social exclusion, and rumors spreading. Two one- way ANOVAs with sociometric status as the independent variable and indirect aggression tendency as the dependent variable yielded sociometric status differences on indirect aggression among both the 6th graders and the 8th graders. Post hoc analyses revealed that the controversial and the rejected subjects in both the 6th grade and the 8th grade are the most frequent users of indirect aggression; they showed higher frequency of indirect aggressive behaviors than those designated as the average, neglected and popular sociometric status. Another gender × age two-way ANOVA with indirect aggression tendency as the dependent variable indicated a significant main effect of gender, a significant main effect of age, and a significant interaction effect of gender and age. Specifically, the indirect aggression tendency was higher for boys than girls as well as higher for 6th graders than 8th graders. However, those two main effects were qualified by the interaction effect. That is, compared with girls in grade 6, boys in grade 6 were more likely to adopt indirect aggression. By contrast, compared with boys in grade 8, girls in grade 8 were more frequent users of indirect aggression. Additionally, compared with boys in grade 8, boys in grade 6 were more likely to adopt indirect aggression. In contrast, girls in grade 6 were not more frequent users of indirect aggression than girls in grade 8.
In summary, the hierarchical model of indirect aggression proposed by French, Jansen, and Pidada (2002) and Underwood (2003) was initially supported. Using peer estimation technique, the present study not only confirmed findings from Crick and Gropeter's (1995) about the connections between indirect aggression and sociometric status but also extended the pattern from middle childhood to preadolescence. Further, the present study offered a possible explanation for why prior studies revealed conflicting gender effect of indirect aggression. Finally, the advantages of using peer estimation technique on measuring indirect aggression were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200706-49-2-205-224-a,49.2,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Who is More Trustworthy in Virtual Community?,"Sy-Feng Wang, Mebel Liu","e-commerce, social network analysis, trustworthiness, virtual community","It is important for participants and owners of virtual communities to find out which participants are trustworthy. However, this challenge has not been adequately addressed in practice and/or in research. Following a well-known tenet that past behavior tends to predict future behavior, we applied social network analysis to examine how participants' past interactions in the MyAV virtual community predict trustworthiness. According to the social network indices derived from a social network matrix, which represents past interactions in the community, we found (1) the ”out-degree centrality” index significantly predicts the competence dimension of trustworthiness (β=0.28, p＜0.01); while the ”in-closeness centrality” index significantly predicts the integrity dimension of trustworthiness (β=0.35, p＜0.01).

The Effects of Number of Turns and Attention on the Perceived Distance and Time in Children and Adults,"Yun-Hsin Liang, Chao-Jung Wu","attention, number of turns, cognitive load, distance perception, time perception","The present study examined the effects of number of turns (0 vs. 5) in a path and participants' attention (focused vs. divided) on their perceived walking distance and walking time. The participants were 50 children from 5 to 6 years old and 60 adults whose average age was 22.75 years. On each trial, the participants had to walk along two 29-meter long paths for 30 seconds (led and controlled by the experimenter). On two trials, the two paths varied with respect to the number of turns. On another two trials, the two paths varied with respect to whether the participants had to simultaneously perform a concurrent digit counting task. At the end of each trial, the participants had to determine which path was longer or of equal length, or which path took longer or equal time to walk. The adult participants had to additionally estimate the distance of the path or the time of walking. Results showed that among the adult participants the path with 5 turns was perceived to have a longer distance and took longer to walk than the path with 0 turn. The path was also perceived to have a longer distance and take longer to walk when the adult participants walked without performing a concurrent cognitive task than when they walked with one. However, the adult participants perceived distance did not correlate significantly with their perceived time. The children also perceived the two paths with different numbers of turns to have different distances and take different amount of time, but they were unable to tell which one was longer or took longer. Contrasted with the adults, the path was perceived by the children to have a shorter distance and take shorter time to walk when they walked without performing a concurrent cognitive task than when they walked with one. The children's perceived distance also correlated significantly with their perceived time. We offered a number of explanations of the results based on the concept of cognitive load and the participants' different strategies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200703-49-1-19-33-a,49.1,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effect of Transparent and Opaque Illusory Contour Occluders on the Motion Interpretation,"Shwu-Lih Huang, Chia-Yang Liu, Hua-Chun Sun, Hung-Wei Lee","transparency, illusory contour, occlusion, midlevel vision, motion perception","Based on the theories of midlevel or mediumlevel vision, the information about visual surfaces can have critical effects on the motion interpretation. Many of the evidences have revealed to support this theoretical point. Following such aspect, the purpose of this study is to explore how the attributes of the surface affect the motion interpretation. The major focus is to test whether the illusory contour, instead of real contour, being the occluders can also have similar effect on the motion interpretation. In addition to this test, the study on how transparency of the occluding surfaces influence motion interpretation is also performed. The paradigm developed by McDermott, Weiss, and Adelson (2001) was used in the present study. In experiments one and two, two types of illusory contour were designed as occluders. The results showed that illusory contour occluders affect motion in a similar manner as that of real contour occluders. And the effect was smaller for the transparent illusory contour as compared to the opaque illusory contour. In the subsequent three experiments, we designed various types of contour and manipulated transparency by different methods for comparison. It was found that the smaller effect of transparent illusory contour, when compared to opaque illusory contour, could be replicated in all three experiments. However, in the condition of real contour, the effect of transparency was not shown. Also, manipulating the transparency by different methods showed different effects in these three experiments. The most stable effect was obtained in manipulating the figural configurations to induce transparency in the illusory contour. Transparency induced by dynamic motion cue only showed a minor effect. Manipulating transparency by static binocular depth did not show any significant effect. From the results of all five experiments, the important role of the surface formation in motion processing which was predicted by the midlevel or medium-level vision theories was partially confirmed. On the other hand, not to be covered by these theories, that transparency of the surface can influence motion interpretation only in some of the conditions was observed in this study. Further research will be needed to reveal more details of the issue.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200703-49-1-35-52-a,49.1,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology

In Study 1 (N=203), college students designated as the healthy-control group (N=85) demonstrated higher identity firmness and lower identity discrepancy than those designated as the psychosomatic group (N=56). Three multiple regression analyses indicated that identity discrepancy was a better predictor of psychosomatic reactions than identity importance, yet its predictability did not differ from identity firmness. Findings of Study 1 were replicated in Study 2 (N=185). Another group of college students designated as the healthy-control group (N=65) demonstrated higher identity firmness and lower identity discrepancy than those designated as the neurosis group (N=56). Study 2 also indicated that identity discrepancy was a better predictor than identity firmness for almost all of the subscales included in the SCL-90R.

The current study was to examine the usefulness of the verbal fluency test in differentiating normal versus incipient dementia, as well as to clarify the issue of whether memory dysfunction contributes to defective performance on the verbal fluency test. Methods: Ninety-four subjects were recruited and classified into four groups, normal educated control, normal illiterate, questionable AD (qAD) and mild AD (mAD). All subjects received the Clinical Dementia Rating, the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument, and verbal fluency test. Results: No significant differences between normal illiterate and normal educated control groups on the verbal fluency test were noted. However, demented patients were impaired in performing the verbal fluency test. Performance differences between AD patients and normal educated control subjects on the vegetable fluency and four-legged animal fluency test could not be attributed to memory impairment. Conclusion: Based on the present result, it appears that the verbal fluency test might be useful for differentiating normal illiterate from incipient dementia. Meanwhile, the result also suggests that deficits of vegetable fluency and four-legged animal fluency observed in the early AD patients might be merely due to executive dysfunction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200703-49-1-73-86-a,49.1,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Psychophysiological Profiling of Sex-offenders and Substance Abusers by Using Multiple Measurement Approaches,"Hung-Yu Lin, Roda Chen, Chih-Ju Liu","Stress Reaction, Substance Abuser, Sex Offender, Psychophysiologic Response","The purpose of this study was to investigate psychophysiologic responses and cognitive schema of two types of abusers (sexual offenders and substance abusers) under stress. 24 sex-offenders and 24 substance abusers were recruited as the experiment group, and another 24 non-addicted offenders were selected as the control group. All the psychophysiologic responses induced in this study were collected by ProComp InfinitiTM. Moreover, while two types of abusers were under stressful conditions (indicated by their psychophysiologic responses), the data of their cognitive schema was also collected. Therefore, three concrete goals were expected to be achieved:
1. To build up the baselines of psychophysiologic response for two types of abusers under neutral and stressful conditions.
2. To compare and contrast their psychophysiologic response with other non-addicted offenders in the different kinds of stress.
3. To explore and compare the cognitive schema of the two types of abusers while the stressful responses were created and the signals from biofeedback were indicated.
The data of this research contained some meaningful clinical implications for this study:
1. The biofeedback equipment (ProComp Infiniti TM) were good indicators to distinguish abusers' psychophysiologic responses under neutral from stressful conditions.
2. Sexual offenders tended to have more hyper psychophysiologic responses when under their offense related stimulus than substance abusers and other types of offenders. Moreover, most sexual offenders expressed much more cognitive distortion in denying their offense and blaming their victims.
3. Substance abuses tended to show higher psychophysiologic responses when under math solving stress; they commonly reported that they were more inclined to elicit their relapse intention when seeing the film about a persons' injection of heroin. More importantly, most substance abusers explicitly indicated that they were not sure whether they would be able to resist the temptation of substances in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200703-49-1-87-103-a,49.1,2007,Chinese Journal of Psychology
An Unitary Operating System for Item Information and Position Information in Verbal Memory,"I-Pei Lee, Ting-Ting Chang, Daisy Hung, Ovid Tzeng, Jun-Ren Lee","working memory, concurrent task, serial position curve","This study investigated whether the processing of item information and position information in verbal memory is dissociable. Hsu, Tzeng, and Hung (1995) reported that the processing of item information and position information in verbal memory is dissociable. However, this conclusion is questionable because Hsu et al. employed different tasks, i.e., free recall task and four-choice recognition task for testing item memory and position memory. To clarify this issue, two experiments were conducted in the current experiment. In the first experiments, subjects were instructed to simultaneously encode and to simultaneously retrieve the item information and the position information. The results showed similar accuracies in the tests for item memory and position memory. The serial position curve was observed in memories for both item memory and position memory. Most importantly, there was no interaction between item information and position information in terms of serial positions. This finding suggests a unified processing system for item information and position information in verbal memory.
In the second experiment, two concurrent tasks were employed to show whether the processing of item information and position information is dissociable. The reduction of accuracy in item memory was larger than that in position memory when articulatory suppression served as the concurrent task. The opposite pattern was observed when the concurrent task was visual pattern recognition. However, there was no interaction between the types of interference task and serial positions. This result provides further support for the claim that there is an unified processing system for item information and position information in verbal memory.
Based on these findings, we conclude that the dissociation between item memory and location memory exists only when different types of material or different types of tasks are used. As long as the stimuli are verbal materials, the item information and the position information of verbal materials are bound together and are processed in the same operating system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200612-48-4-315-327-a,48.4,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Phonological Priming in Visual Word Recognition for English Words: An Event-Related Functional MRI Study,"Tai-Li Chou, Matthew H. Davis, William D. Marslen-Wilson, James R. Booth","priming, language, regularity, fMRI","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to explore the nature of the mappings between orthography, phonology, and semantics in reading English words. Stimulus pairs were arranged in a priming paradigm with lexical decision to understand the neural correlates of phonological processes. Homophonic targets varied in the regularity of the mapping from spelling to sound (e.g., feet-feat, bare-bear). There were three main findings. First, the results revealed that the left middle temporal gyrus (BA 21) showed increased neural activity for phonologically primed irregular pairs consistent with increased semantic involvement in making lexical decisions when the mapping between orthography and phonology is made difficult. Second, the left supramarginal gyrus (BA 40) was associated with reduced neural activity for phonologically-identical pairs with regular spelling to sound correspondences, when the mapping between orthography and phonology is made easy. Third, the visual association cortex including the left fusiform gyrus (BA 37) showed more activation in the homophone pairs compared to the unrelated pairs and more activation for pseudoword targets compared to word targets, suggesting that this region may have been involved in a spelling check on lexical decisions. These three findings show how phonological priming effects on behaviour can result from a complex interaction of several processing phases involving both increases and decreases of activity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200612-48-4-329-346-a,48.4,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The nature of such processes has been intensively studied in the western literature. However, there is a paucity of research on the issue with Chinese subjects. In this phonological-priming study, Chinese-speaking participants made lexical decision to disyllabic visual targets after hearing monosyllabic or disyllabic prime words. In Experiments 1A and 1B, lexical decision responses were faster when the monosyllabic primes corresponded to the first syllables of the disyllabic targets than when they did not. In Experiment 2, lexical decision responses were faster when the disyllabic primes were identical to the disyllabic targets than when the prime-target pairs shared nothing in common. However, lexical decision responses became slower when the prime-target pairs only shared the first syllable than when they shared nothing in common.

The Influence of Task and Time on Object-Based Attention,"Ming-Chou Ho, Paul Atchley","task type, object preview time, object-based attention","Object-based attention theory proposes that attention can be directed to the content (e.g., objects) of a scene regardless of spatial restrictions. The current experiments examined if the spatial extent of object-based attentional representations are also modulated by task. In three experiments, the presence of costs to switch attention between objects was found to be modulated by task difficulty, preview time for the objects, and the cue-to-target SOA. In general, simpler tasks and more time (object preview or cue-to-target SOA) allow for object switching costs at more distant locations on an object.

The Influence of Individual Performance and Relative Group Performance on the Selection of the best-fit Group,"Hung-Mao Lin, Chien-Ru Sun","group identification, social mobility, the best-fit group","The new concept of ”the best-fit group” is proposed in this study. In the best-fit group, individuals are able to maintain their positive self-evaluation. The author suggests that the purpose of social mobility is to achieve a positive self-evaluation, and therefore the ”best-fit group” should be the target group of the movement. The best-fit group is qualified when two criteria were met: 1) the individual should feel he himself is more capable, at least not worse, than the average group members. 2) among all the possible alternatives, this group should be the best group that the individual can get.
In experiment 1, four hundred and twenty one senior high students were assigned to read different scenarios. The scenarios were constructed based on a 3 (individual performance: good vs. medium vs. poor)×2 (the cue of the relative group performance: explicit vs. vague) factorial design. The main dependent measures were behavior intention of social mobility and the expectation of future performance. As predicted, results indicated that when the explicit cue was provided and participants were able to identify their own best-fit group, they tended to choose the best-fit group as their target group. In contrast, individuals showed no psychological mobility toward the best-fit group, when the cue was vague and the best-fit group could not be identified. In experiment 2, one hundred and twenty one Chung-Yuan University students were randomly assigned to the best-fit or the non-best-fit conditions. The ”best-fit” or the ”non-best-fit” conditions were qualified by matching the relative group performance and individual performance. The results gave further support to the hypotheses, participants who were already in the best-fit groups showed higher in-group identification and lower social mobility, whereas those who were in the non-best-fit conditions had lower in-group identification and showed a strong tendency moving toward their own best-fit groups.
The concept of ”best-fit group” gained strong support in the study and it did provide the best explanations and most accurate predictions of social mobility. Further implications are also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200612-48-4-387-409-a,48.4,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"The Interrelationship among the Openness of Group Boundary, Group Performance and membership-turnover","Kirk Chang, Mei-Kuei Chen","Membership Turnover, Group Dynamics, Structure","Inspired by the Social Dilemma Theory (SDT; Dawes, 1980), the current project aimed to analyze the impact of free-rider behaviors and the fear of being taken advantage on collective tasks. The hypothesis envisaged was that higher membership turnover was related to poorer group performance, unstable group dynamics, and group destabilization phenomenon, respectively. The project comprised three studies.
Study One recruited forty-eight undergraduate students for a lab-based experiment and estimated the influence of membership turnover on group destabilization, including: intention of leaving and actual leaving behaviour. Statistical results demonstrated that, compared to their counterparts, members from turnover-groups had a stronger intention of leaving groups and a higher occurrence of leaving behaviour. Study Two recruited seventy-eight undergraduate students and conducted a series of investment games in computer labs. The rationale was to compare group responses in terms of group trust and cooperation during the investment games. Statistical results indicated that, compared to their counterparts, members from nonturnover-groups were more likely to cooperate/trust with each other and had a better group performance. Study Three adopted six Taiwanese baseball teams as analytic samples. Statistical results revealed that both new-player-turnover (NPT) and exit-player-turnover (EPT) were negatively associated with the performance indexes. Specifically, higher-turnover teams (i.e., teams with higher NPT or EPT) were more likely to receive poorer performance indexes, such as inferior annual rankings and lower win odds. Cross-Analysis confirmed that high turnover is linked to group destabilization, but it remains undecided as to whether low turnover may contribute to group stabilization.
In summary, the findings reported here have contributed concrete and useful information to the knowledge of group turnover and its impact on group stability and performance. The group leaders and organizational managers should be aware that all personnel manipulation and intervene programmes will not reach their optimal potential unless the impact of turnover has been appropriately tackled. Implication and limitation of the findings are discussed accordingly.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200612-48-4-411-424-a,48.4,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology

We examined the patterns of coping strategies and the conditions to use those strategies in real-time. First, we reviewed and categorized varied types of coping strategies in the literature, and then examined how these prescriptive strategies are used in real life. To analyze individual difference in strategic preference, we examined different ways of uncertainty conceptualization, and ability and need for cognitive structuring. Drawing on those factors, we then constructed five contingent models of coping strategy selection. To examine how coping strategies in prescriptive theories are used in real life, we adopted naturalistic method by analyzing 480 decision making scenarios collected from participants' experience. We measured decision makers' ability and need for cognitive structuring, and divided them into 4 archetypes. We used corresponding analysis to study the systematic mapping among uncertainty conceptualization, ability and need for cognitive structuring, and patterns of selected strategies. The result indicates that those uncertainty coping strategies suggested by prescriptive theories are used unequally in real life.

A norms study was conducted to collect the subjective ratings of brand exposure frequency and the involvement scores for various product categories, on which the selection of materials of three experiments were based. Experiment 1 used a standard recognition memory task, while a brand reality judgment task was used in the study phase of Experiment 2. Recognition performance in Experiment 3 was measured using the remember/know procedure (Tulving, 1985). Results show that both hit rate and false alarm rate of well-known brands were higher than less familiar brands and these effects were related to remember responses. Brand awareness appears to affect brand representation in a way different from word frequency and the mirror effect typically associated with word frequency (Glanzer & Adams, 1985) was thus not observed for brand awareness. In addition, the hit rate of brands from low-involvement products was higher than that from high-involvement products. The false alarm effect of brand awareness was present only in brands from high-involvement products. The involvement related effects were demonstrated in both remember and know responses. The manner in which brands are cognitively represented provides explanations for current findings.

A longitudinal study was divided into two experiments: a modified paradigm of symbol comprehension by Tomasello, et al. (1999) and spontaneous play measurements, for testing children with autism (mean CA=41 months, mean MA=27 months), and MA-matched children, with developmental delay and typical development. For measuring symbol comprehension, two sets of replicate and natural toys were arranged in the first experiment, and one other set of functional toys was added in the second experiment. Gesticulatory and object prompts were arranged in each condition. In the first experiment, children in all three groups displayed higher results on the replicate condition than on the natural condition in symbol comprehension. Children with developmental delay and typical development, revealed an ability to understand the symbol comprehension of the replicate set, but not the natural set. However, children with autism showed impairments on symbol comprehensions concerning both replicate and natural sets. In spontaneous play, there was no difference in any play skills among the three groups. In the second experiment, after 18 months, both the children with autism and those with developmental delay, showed intact symbol comprehension of replicate and natural sets, but deficiency in relation to the functional set. However, high functioning autism did not encounter this barrier. In spontaneous play, although autistic children could demonstrate similar frequencies as children with developmental delay did, in functional play and symbolic play, children with autism showed fewer types on the schema on functional play. The concept, symbolic play deficit in autism, was partly supported by this study. Most of children with autism could gradually develop the capacity of dual representation; and moreover, in the case of high functioning autism, symbol comprehension of triune representation remained intact. Their difficulties are more on the flexibility of functional or symbolic spontaneous play, rather than symbolic comprehension. The implications on diagnosis and early intervention were discussed. The limitations of the study and the direction of further studies are also provided.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200609-48-3-255-273-a,48.3,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Aging Effect on Mating Preference Thresholds of Age and Height,Jung-Fu Chang,"Marriage Market, Mate Selection, Age preference, Height preference, sexual selection","In the studies on mating preferences, evolutionary theory (sexual selection) suggests that gender differences in mating preference are based on genetic prerogatives (e.g., Kenrick and Keefe, 1992), and that different genders follow different patterns of changing mating preferences, accompanying increases of their ages. On the other hand, marriage market theory in demographics, suggests that aging men and women confront different marriage markets and different pressures from shrinking marital opportunities. Hence, they adjust their mating preferences accordingly (e.g., South, 1991). The present study examines the application of these two theories on gender difference of age threshold and height threshold, by using individual level data on the mate selection web site in Taiwan. The major findings are: (1) Men, in general, set much lower age thresholds than women do. Moreover, in aging, men lower the floor-age thresholds to a greater degree than do women. These confirm the predictions of evolutionary theory. (2) Women lower their height threshold when they are getting old, to compensate for their diminished marriage opportunities. These results only partly confirm the prediction of marriage market theory. (3) While aging men lower the ceilingage threshold, women raise the ceiling-age threshold. For this result, the combination of the two theories provides a better explanation than either evolutionary theory or marriage market theory does on its own. (4) To our surprise, men raise their height threshold when they are getting old. This neither confirms the prediction of evolutionary theory nor marriage market theory. The unexpected result will be discussed in detail.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200609-48-3-275-289-a,48.3,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Relationship between Chinese Dialectical Thinking and the Implicit Theory of Personality-Behavior Association,Kung-Yu Hsu,"Chinese personality perception, implicit theory, Chinese dialectical thinking, interpersonal behavior","We conducted two studies, exploring the relationship between Chinese dialectical thinking and the implicit theory of personality-behavior association which refers to the associative schema about a target person with certain kind of personality trait that would lead him to perform certain kinds of interpersonal behavior. Such as when a stranger is feared and his motive is doubted, the obesever would predict this target person having certain specific kind of personality trait, and conclude that this stranger might perform some negative (or harmful) behaviors. However, when using dialectical thinking, people would wind up predicting that persons with positive personalities might behave in negative ways. Hsu (2003) presented a new theoretical conception, coined as the implicit theory of personality behavior association. The relationship between this implicit theory and interpersonal interaction was examined. It was considered that before interacting with a stranger, people tend to predict that the target person will perform some kinds of interpersonal behaviors based on their knowledge about this target's personality information. Dialectical thinking was manipulated by a cognitive task in Study 1, and measured by the ”middle way” scale in Study 2. On the whole, the results supported the predictions that people with high dialectical thinking had more negative predictions of targets' behaviors, especially targets with positive personality traits, and that these negative predictions of targets' behavior influenced subjects' interaction behaviors. The results are discussed in terms of the impact of dialectical thinking on personality perception and interpersonal interaction.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200609-48-3-291-313-a,48.3,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Structures of texts were manipulated to create a hierarchical version in which all story episodes were organized by a major common goal and a sequential version in which each story episode was served by a distinctive goal. Experiment 1 revealed that hierarchical texts benefit Chinese readers than sequential versions for text-based representation but not for situation models. Experiment 2, using more authentic stories which carry clear moral, indicated that hierarchical stories benefit students for both levels of representation whereas the effect of grade appears for situation models only but not for text-based representation. Older readers did not differ from younger readers in text-based representation but performed better in situation models across two experiments.

Two experiments were conducted. Chinese-English bilingual subjects' performance of spatial memory was measured. In both experiments, subjects were given cues of English or Chinese spatial terms before they were asked to remember a picture. In Exp.1, task difficulty was manipulated by changing the duration of exposure to the picture. In Exp.2, task difficulty was manipulated by changing the amount of contents to be remembered. By comparing the performance between the cued groups and the control groups under different levels of task difficulty, a crossover interaction effect between language and task difficulty on the non-linguistic spatial memory was observed.

"Word Frequency, Not Age of Acquisition, Affects Word Naming: The Role of Childhood Frequency",Jane Y. J. Hsu,"age of acquisition, word frequency, word naming","Two experiments were conducted to assess the importance of age-of-acquisition (AoA) and frequency in a word naming task. In addition to adulthood-frequency, childhood-frequency calculated from elementary textbooks of participants was used. A real age-of-acquisition was taken to be the age at which the word was first read on the textbook. In Experiment 1, the traditional adulthood-frequency was used for grouping and matching and two different word sets of early-acquired, low-frequency was chosen by their childhood-frequency to be low (CL) or high (CH). With CL words, both AoA and frequency effects had independent effects but no effect of interaction. With CH words, both AoA and frequency effects had independent effects and a significant interaction effect was also found. The AoA effect in low frequency was actually larger for CH words than for CL words (36 vs. 19 ms). In Experiment 2, the sum of childhood-frequency and adulthood-frequency was used for grouping and matching. A significant frequency effect was found but no AoA effect on either mixed or pure word sets once the total frequency was controlled. These results implicated that previous reports of effect of AoA on word-naming speed might be artifactual, being due to a confounding of AoA with childhoodfrequency.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200606-48-2-151-162-a,48.2,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Do Chinese Commit Neither Fundamental Attribution Error Nor Ultimate Attribution Error?,"Yunn-Wen Lien, Ruey-Ling Chu, Chun-Hui Jen, Chia-Hua Wu","ultimate attribution error, fundamental attribution error, group-serving bias, attribution, cultural difference","Morris and Peng (1994) reported that subjects with Chinese heritage weight situational factors more than dispositional factors when a killing behavior was attributed, regardless the killer's nationality. They therefore argued that Chinese committed neither (1) fundamental attribution error nor (2) ultimate attribution error. The Collectivism/Individualism distinction of culture was used to explain the results.
We pointed out that two types of situational information should be distinguished. One is situational information that might facilitate or explain the occurrence of the target behavior, such as being treated unfairly might facilitate a killing behavior. The other is inhibitory situational information, such as social norm or bystanders' pleading that might prohibit a killing behavior. Previous research has revealed that these two types of situational information might respectively lead to the discounting effect or increase the dispositional attribution. Being more sensitive to situational information therefore would not necessarily lead to the tendency toward situational attribution.
Two studies aimed at clarifying the above argument were reported in the current research. Study 1, with local Taiwanese subjects, used the same cover stories as Morris & Peng (study 3, 1994) but equated the story content for in/out group by exchange the nationality of the killer. The results showed that Taiwanese subjects attributed the killing to dispositional factors much more than to the situational factors as we predicted, particularly for the ”student cover story”, and there was an interaction between attributional tendency and nationality, opposite to what have reported. We argued that Morris & Peng's findings could be better explained by the specialty of subjects and inequality of content for in/out group.
To further test whether Taiwanese treat in/out group member differently in attribution, factors that explained the loss of a candidate in Taiwan presidential election of 2000 were weighted by those who did and did not support the candidate in Study 2. It showed that out-group voters weighted dispositional factors more than the in-group voters for the failure of a candidate, which consisted with the so-called ultimate attribution error or, more general, the group-serving bias. Implications for attribution tendency of Chinese and the potential problems of cross culture studies are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200606-48-2-163-181-a,48.2,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Face to face questionnaire survey is conducted with 302 preschool teachers from Kaohsiung City and Kaohsiung County. The major instruments for this study are preschool teacher situational judgment questionnaire, Yuarn-Feng beliefs scale, mental health scale, and job performance checking scale. The obtained data is analyzed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), product-moment correlation, and structural equation modeling (SEM). According to confirmatory factor analysis, preschool teachers' practical intelligence includes abilities to adapt, shape, and select their environment. Preschool teachers' Yuarn-Feng beliefs includes Yuarn attribution (fatalism) and Feng attribution (will-power) about real life. Preschool teachers' mental health includes wellbeing memory, happy emotion, and compatibility for psychological condition. Preschool teachers' job performance includes in-role and extra-role behavior in working setting. Based on productmoment correlation, we find that preschool teachers' practical intelligence is positively correlated with job performance, Yuarn attribution is positively correlated with mental health, Feng attribution is positively correlated with job performance. However, structural equation modeling analysis shows data fit our hypothesized model quite well.

Nevertheless, controversial evidence has merged, suggesting that physiological arousal might be insufficient to realize the comorbidity of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depressive disorders. Furthermore, other syndrome, namely apprehension (or worry), which being strongly related to GAD, was not included in the model. Taken together, we proposed a hypothesized model which included apprehension to account for the comorbidity and specificity of GAD and depression. Two hundred and eighty six adult participants were interviewed via a battery of self-report scales. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we tested the proposed hypothesized model.

Williams and Pollock (2000, 2002) claimed that suicide was the result of the interaction of three factors, namely, defeat, no escape, and no rescue. In the present study, we translated the three factors into loss of resource, control, and hopelessness to evaluate Williams and Pollock s claim. We hypothesized that when suicide attempters experienced a loss of resource, the different coping strategies they adopted would have different consequences on their risk of committing suicide. One hundred and forty six suicide attempters, referred through the suicide prevention report system established for the survivors of the 921 Chi-Chi major earthquake, were administered the Loss of Resources Scale, the Control Regulation Questionnaire, the Hopelessness Scale, and the Degree of Suicide Scale. Path analysis of the data revealed two paths showing direct influence on suicide attempter s risk of committing suicide.

"Infants and Preschoolers Imitation of Object Manipulation: The Influences of Movement Path, Perceptual Saliency, and Task Constraints","Chi-Tai Huang, Shin-Ru Jiang","action representation, goal-directed imitation, tool use, understanding of intentions, imitation","The goal-directed imitation theory suggests that imitation involves representing an observed action as a set of components that are hierarchically specified from major to less important goals. Given limited resources, children tend to encode end points as dominant over movement paths. Under this logic, two experiments were conducted here to examine imitative performance of infants and preschoolers using object manipulation tasks. In Experiment 1, the experimenter performed a sequence of two actions on objects unimanually with ipsilateral or contralateral hand paths. In each condition, some actions were followed by their salient effects; some were not. In Experiment 2, the adult manipulated two objects with the same hand while the other hand grasped a cup or was free staying close to chest. In two experiments, children from both age groups were likely to reenact the observed actions with ipsilateral hands. This ipsilateral preference was not affected by either perceptual saliency or task constraints. In contrast to the Bekkering, Wohlschl ger, and Gattis (2000) study, contralateral responses were relatively rare in the present study. While it may not be possible here to identify how much the goal-directed process reduces the tendency to copy the adult s behavioral strategy and contralateral actions, it is important to consider the constraints inherent in the current task.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200603-48-1-13-33-a,48.1,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Process of Transforming Daily Social Interactions to Relationship Intimacy: A Longitudinal Study,"Yi-Cheng Lin, Chin-Lan Huang","responsiveness, self-disclosure, intimacy, Revised Rochester Interaction Record","In the past three decades, the debate of which factor, self-disclosure or partner responsiveness, plays the central role in the process of intimacy is still on and the dynamics among these factors remain unknown. According to Reis & Shaver (1988), however, the intimacy process begins when one person expresses personally revealing feelings or information to another person. To become intimate, the discloser must also feel understood, validated, cared for by the listener. Thus, this theory suggests that the specific combination of self-disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness plays an essential role in the development of relationship intimacy. Although the model does provide an insightful perspective, little empirical research has yet been done to test this model. The current study is design to test this theoretical model, looking at the role of self-disclosure and partner responsiveness in the process of transforming daily social interactions to relationship intimacy. Furthermore, a longitudinal follow-up was conducted, in which both relationship intimacy and social interaction data were collected both in the Fall and Spring semesters. Participants recorded their daily social interactions using the Revised Rochester Social Interaction Record and their relationship intimacy with the interaction partners were measured by a Q-sort method. Because this study was a simulated within-subject design, hierarchical within-subject regression analyses were conducted, which ruled out individual differences and permitted us to focus exclusively on relationship processes. Two regression analyses were first conducted for the two cross-sectional phases separately. In both cases, the simple effects as well as the unique effects of self-disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness were all significant. The results supported the hypothesis that both self-disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness are functional in the process of intimacy. The consistent results from both semesters also indicate that this correlation pattern was reliable. Cross-lag analysis showed that all the variables in time 1 were predictive of all the variables in time 2, indicating that the causal directions might not be linear nor unidirectional. Nonetheless, there were other trends especially worth noting. First, the highest correlation was between two relationship intimacy indices, whereas the interaction indices were relatively less reliable compared to the relationship intimacy. Second, both cross-sectional and cross-lag analyses showed that perceived partner responsiveness had relatively stronger effect sizes than did self-disclosure. The theoretical implications of these results were discussed. In addition, the contributions of the current methodology to the study of personal relationships and relationship processes were also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200603-48-1-35-52-a,48.1,2006,Chinese Journal of Psychology

However, the correlations between the relationship quality at time 1 and the AEE at time 2 or vice versa were not stable. Regression analysis and cross-lagged analysis indicated no one way causal relationship between them.

In the study, emotion labor included expression of positive emotion and suppression of negative emotion. The results demonstrated that the interaction between job involvement and suppression of negative emotion significantly predicted emotional exhaustion. When job involvement was high, suppression of negative emotion did not predict emotional exhaustion; when job involvement was low, suppression of negative emotion predicted emotional exhaustion positively. However, the interaction between job involvement and expression of positive emotion did not predict emotional exhaustion. Therefore, the interaction effect between job involvement and suppression of negative emotion was stronger than the interaction between job involvement and expression of positive emotion. Besides, the interaction between ability of regulating other s emotion and suppression of negative emotion significantly predicted emotional exhaustion. When ability of regulating other s emotion was high, suppression of negative emotion did not predict emotional exhaustion; when ability of regulating other s emotion was low, suppression of negative emotion predicted emotional exhaustion positively. However, the interaction between ability of regulating other s emotion and expression of positive emotion did not predict emotional exhaustion. Therefore, the interaction between the ability of regulating other s emotion and suppression of negative emotion was stronger than the interaction between the ability of regulating other s emotion and expression of positive emotion.

The resulting scale scores were evaluated with respect to the raw-to-scale score conversions, summary statistics, and measurement properties computed based on the strong true score theory. The contributions of the individual tests to the BCTEST Composite, the gaps resulting from the conversions, and the effects of rounding and truncation were also assessed. The findings indicated that each score format had its advantages and disadvantages with respect to some of the criteria, but no one format possessed all desired characteristics. Regarding the effective contributions of the tests to the Composite, the z-score type seemed to be the most promising. But, in terms of the criterion of constant error variance along the scale, the number-correct type, and to a lesser extent, the proportion-correct type were the choices.

An Exploratory Investigation of Differences in Personality Traits and Faith Maturity among Major Religions in Taiwan,"Tung-Shan Chou, Mei-Ching Chen","personality traits, faith maturity, prosocial behavior, religion","This study seeks to investigate the effects of religion on personality traits, positive and negative facets of psychosocial development, and prosocial behaviors. To control for the extent of religiousness, we applied a four-fold typology to classify individuals into different faith types in addition to their religious affiliations. This typology distinguishes an integrated religious faith from other types of faith. We hypothesized that people of different faith types would display significantly different patterns of personality traits and prosocial behaviors, and that the differences among faith types will be greater than those seen among the self-reported religious affiliations.
The Chinese versions of NEO Personality Inventory-Revised, Measures of Psychosocial Development, Prosocial Behavior Inventory, and Faith Maturity Scale were administered to 544 students from 15 colleges and universities in Taiwan. Five major religious groups were identified according to their self-reported religious affiliations: Buddhist, Catholic, Protestant, Taiwanese folklore follower, and No-religion. The Taiwanese folklore group consisted of those who claimed to be Taoists, I-Kuan-Dao, and those who worship deities that were originally good people as so portrayed in the Taiwanese legends.
The empirical results supported our research hypotheses. Specifically, the effect of faith type surpassed the self-professed religious affiliation and faith types differed significantly with respect to profiles of their personality, psychosocial development, and prosocial behaviors. In particular, the integrated faith type showed significantly better profiles than other faith types in relation to socially desirable personality traits and prosocial behaviors.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200512-47-4-311-327-a,47.4,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Visual stimuli used in this study were seven different kinds of objects (color chip, cup, T-shirt, chair, motorcycle, floppy disk, and backpack) with their 8 primary colors (red, orange, yellow, yellow-green, green, blue-green, blue, and purple). Identical objects with eight different colors were presented on the computer screen each time. Subjects were given five seconds to browse each object with eight different colors per trial. An eye tracking machine was used to track their eye movements. After subjects finish browsing all objects, they were asked to rank the color preference for each object. Results from MANOVA showed that the fixation time, fixation counts and return counts were significantly longer and higher for more preferred colors. In addition, subjects had longer fixation time and higher fixation counts for color chips than other kinds of objects.

Suppression of Autonomic Nervous System Caused by Worry,"Chia-Ying Weng, Min-Hung Teng","heart rate variability, pathological worry, autonomic nervous system, worry","Pathological worry is a major element of generalized anxiety disorders. Borkovec proposed the negative reinforcement hypothesis to explain the maintenance pathological worry. Borkovec and Hu (1990) examined the inhibition of heart rate variability (HRV) by worry, and argued that this inhibitory effect reflected the suppression of the parasympathetic nervous system. However, a review of the literature indicated that worry also inhibited the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The aim of this study is to test the suppressive effects of worry on the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Fifty-two participants (28 male, 24 female) were randomly assigned to three groups (the worry group, the re-exposure group and the control group). All participants experienced four experimental stages including baseline, fearful movie, mental task and recovery stage. In the baseline and recovery stages, all of the participants were asked to sit peacefully. In the fearful movie stage, all of the participants saw a fearful movie. In the mental task stage, members of the worry group were asked to read the worrying sentences, members of the re-exposure group were asked to recall aversive movie images, and the members of the control group were asked to sit peacefully. The data showed that the HRV and the sympathetic activity indices of the worry group were lower during the mental task stage than during the fearful movie stage. Moreover, the HRV and sympathetic activity indices of the members of the worry group were also lower than those of the re-exposure group during the mental task stage.

The Role of Divergent Thinking in Creative Problem Solving,"Wei-Lun Lin, Yunn-Wen Lien, Chun-Hui Jen","insight problem, creativity, 2-4-6 problem, divergent thinking, hypothesis generation","It is often thought that divergent thinking is the base for solving problem creatively, for the more ideas an individual generates, the more likely he will hit the answer. This idea however has never been tested empirically, partly due to a lack of measurable index regarding the creativity of hypothesis generation. The current research therefore aimed at 1) defining an index featuring creativity in hypothesis generation; 2) investigating the relation between divergent thinking and creativity in problem solving, which has been reframed as a process of generating and revising hypotheses to reach a goal by many researchers. The authors argued that the ”2 4 6 problem”, a rule discovery task which had long been regarded as a task involving inductive reasoning, could be regarded as an insight problem from the perspective of hypothesis generation, and therefore suitable for representing creativity in problem solving. Since many subjects who failed to discover the correct rule in ”2 4 6 problem” were due to lack of perspective shifting while generating hypothesis, the authors therefore proposed that how different a new hypothesis is from the previous ones could serve as an useful index for creativity in problem solving. New-perspective hypotheses only referred to those hypotheses that located in different branches at the most and the second most abstract levels of the tree diagram composed of all the hypotheses generated in the ”2 4 6 problem” by all the 8lsubjects in the current research.
Experiment 1 aimed at justifying the new index by establishing its relation with the association theory of creativity (Mednick, 1962). A Lexical Decision Task (LDT) was designed to measure the different abilities of remote association, indicated by the differences in priming effect between strong- and weak-associated word pairs. The results of 81 subjects from National Taiwan University showed that remote association ability significantly correlated with the generation of new-perspective hypotheses in ”2 4 6 problem”, which then predicted the solving of the problem.
Experiment 2 then investigated whether the ability of divergent thinking would predict the creativity in hypothesis generation represented by the new-established index as well as the success in problem solving. The same group of subjects performed a Chinese version of Divergent Thinking Test (Wu, 1998) a week from Experiment 1. The results showed the scores of divergent thinking test predicted neither the creativity in hypothesis generation nor the success rate of solving the ”2 4 6 problem”. Implications for distinguishing creativity required by art creation and scientific discovery as well as for enhancing creativity were discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200509-47-3-211-227-a,47.3,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology
From Human Nature Belief to Parenting Behavior: Mediation Process Hypothesis,Wen-Ying Lin,"parenting behavior, mediation process hypothesis, human nature belief parenting belief, attribution process","What we know about parenting cuts across two areas: parenting belief and parenting behavior. However, it has been difficult to construct an account of parental behavior based on parenting belief. The present research proposes a ”mediation process hypothesis” to sketch the process form cognitive foundation to everyday parenting practice. The main arguments of this hypothesis are: (a) Human nature belief has different origin from parenting belief and is a better index of parenting behavior. (b) Human nature belief has impact both on parent's attribution of children's misbehavior and the practical meaning of attribution, which mediate parenting behavior. (c) Human nature belief has impact on parents' efficacy judgment in parenting which also mediates the parenting behavior. Two measurements of human nature belief and parenting belief and five vignettes were designed to test this hypothesis.
2011 parents and teachers responded to 18 statements as well as to the misbehavior of five story characters as if they were parents of the characters. The subjects were asked to attribute the possible cause of story characters' misbehavior and to evaluate the effectiveness of parenting in each case. The manipulation of the parenting situations is the consistency of behavior development of the story characters. As predicted, results supported almost all of the argument of the hypothesis proposed. Implications for the current findings are discussed and some suggestions are offered for researchers in the future to overcome the methodological hurdles.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200509-47-3-229-248-a,47.3,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Developmental Differences of Identity Content and Exploration among Adolescents of Different Stages,"Kun-Hu Chen, Keng-Ling Lay, Yin-Chang Wu","social identity, identity firmness, identity importance, image identity, personal identity","Erik Erikson postulated that identity formation is the most important developmental task during adolescence. Past research has investigated the variety of identity status, and the different domains of identity content. However, they failed to capture Eriksonian concept of the sameness and continuity in identity achievement, neither did they reflect Erikson's emphasis on role experimentation that is essential for the resolution of identity crisis. Based on Erikson's theory, the aims of the present study are fourfold. The first is to describe the vicissitude of different identity content in the different substages during adolescence. The second is to identify the specific identity contents that serve to be the developmental crises puzzled by adolescents of different stages. The third is to enlarge the conceptualization of identity content proposed by Cheek (1989) in order to reflect Eriksonian thinking about role experimentation. The fourth goal of the present study is to add a new measurement, namely, identity firmness, to reflect Erikson's belief that identity formation reflects one's self-continuity and sameness in his or her value systems and beliefs. A total of 472 junior high school students, 588 high school students, and 225 college students in Taiwan filled up a 5-point-scale questionnaire to rate on their sense of importance, firmness, and experiences of exploration in various aspects related to the issues of self-identity. Results of factor analyses indicated that, in addition to Personal Identity, Social Identity, and Collective Identity proposed by Cheek (1989), one more aspect of identity content, Image Identity, should be included in understanding the development of self-identity. The construct of Image Identity is based on characteristics of private-self. It also reflects Harter's (1990a) postulation of ”trait labels.” Cross age comparisons measuring sense of importance revealed that junior high and high school students are more concerned about social and image identity, whereas college students are more concerned about personal identity. Meantime, college students' degree of sense of firmness is significantly higher than junior high and high school students' on personal, social and image identity. On the other hand, junior high school students' degree of sense of firmness does not differ from that of high school students in personal and social identity; surprisingly, their average score on image identity is even higher than that of high school students. Results of this study indicate that the rating on firmness is a measuring dimension independent from the rating of importance.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200509-47-3-249-268-a,47.3,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Body Image and Its Predictors in Taiwan: Interpersonal Pressure and Media Agreement as Mediators,"Li-Li Huang, Chin-Hwa Chang","social orientation, objectification theory, media agreement, body images, gender consciousness, model of dual attitudes","Since the 90's, body image has become an important theme of research in social scientists' eyes. Both domestic and international research has found that people tend to feel more and more frustrated with their body image, and much more people feel dissatisfied with their own body and distort their own body shape. However, most studies focus solely on college students, teenagers and females. This study is based on a large representative survey sample of almost 2000 adults conducted by Academia Sinica at Taiwan in 2003. It reexamines Taiwanese body images (including three components: body distortion, body satisfaction, and body change) and its influencing factors and path.
Results showed that the mean objective body shape (Body Mass Index, BMI) of the sample was within standard health ranges, but people tended to overestimate their body shape (especially females and young people). In addition, gender and age were found to have significant influence on body images. On average, females and young people showed more body distortion, body dissatisfaction and more desire for body change. Older adults showed less body distortion and dissatisfaction and less impact of interpersonal pressure. Moreover, interpersonal pressure was the most significant mediating factor between gender and age, and body image. Romantic partners' and intimate others' criticism of the body was the first priority of concern for females under 35, and clothes clerks' criticism was second. The influence of media and gender consciousness was not as strong as expected. Finally, using body images as dependent variables, gender and age as independent variables, and interpersonal pressure and media agreement as mediating variables; a structural equation model (SEM) was constructed and found to have an acceptable fit with the data. Objectification theory is applied to illustrate the significant differences between body images according to gender and age; Chinese social orientation is used to explain how interpersonal pressure is an strong effective mediator of gender and age differences; the trade-off between trusting and criticizing media results in a weakening the influence of media, and finally, distinguishing explicit attitudes from implicit attitudes is used to explain the lack of mediation effects for gender consciousness.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200509-47-3-269-287-a,47.3,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Influence of Attachment Style and Internet Interpersonal Interactions on Internet Addiction,"Yi-Cheng Lin, Chen-Hua Wang, Chia-Huei Wu","internet addiction, attachment style, internet interpersonal interaction","The literature has indicated that interpersonal interactions on the net play a major role in the process of internet addiction. These interpersonal interactions show a distinctive pattern of disinhibition characterized by high intimacy, high self-disclosure, and high uncertainty. This pattern is most compatible with the internal working model of the ambivalent attachment style. Thus, we predicted that ambivalent people would be induced to display more disinhibitive interpersonal behaviors and in turn, have stronger internet addiction than the other two attachment styles. Two studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. The first study confirmed our hypothesis that ambivalent tendency was more predictive of internet addiction than the other two attachment tendencies. Furthermore, the interpersonal interactions on the net partially mediated the relationship between ambivalent tendency and internet addiction. We refined our categorization of internet interpersonal interactions in study two to improve our measurement. We further developed a new measure of internet interpersonal perception based on the theory of internal working model. Study two replicated the major findings obtained in study one, that is, ambivalent tendency significantly predicted internet addiction. Moreover, the relationship between ambivalent tendency and internet addiction was completely mediated by internet interpersonal interactions. The results supported our arguments that personality characteristics and internet behaviors reciprocally influence internet addiction, either one only shows a single side of the story. Also, it is important to point out that interpersonal interaction is a major pathway to internet addiction, especially for ambivalent people. Consequently, the therapeutic implication would not be to block them from getting online but rather, to regulate their interpersonal behaviors on the net.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200509-47-3-289-309-a,47.3,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology
In Pursuit of Happiness: The Cultural Psychological Study of SWB,Luo Lu,"cultural psychology, happiness, SWB","In the present paper, we took the position that cultural conceptions of happiness are critical aspects of SWB, which has largely been neglected thus far. We argued that culture and SWB are most productively analyzed together as a dynamic of mutual constitution. Adopting a cultural psychological approach, we selectively reviewed our own indigenous Chinese research to illuminate on two evolving themes regarding SWB: (1) conceptions of happiness, and (2) cultural correlates of happiness. We have shown that distinct characteristics of the conception of happiness are prevalent in Chinese and Western cultures, which can be systematically analyzed, discerned, and measured. The individual-oriented Euro-American cultural conception of SWB is composed of two distinct characteristics: personal accountability and explicit pursuit. In contrast, the social-oriented East Asian cultural conception of SWB is composed of two distinct characteristics: role obligations and dialectical balance.
We have also demonstrated that culture can impact on the SWB process through diverse self conceptions and their consonant beliefs. These self-regulatory mechanisms then determine how people think, feel and behave in the pursuit of SWB. Finally, we have underlined the emerging coexistence of contrasting cultural rudiments in the case of SWB.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200506-47-2-99-112-a,47.2,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Identification of Anxiogenic Stimuli for Behavioral Performance in the Elevated T-maze,"Yea-Huey Chang, Ruey-Ming Liao","anxiolytic drug, openness, escape, conditioned avoidance, rat","In the elevated T-maze, a rat can rapidly acquire the conditioned avoidance behavior when remaining in the enclosed area instead of lingering in the open area. Immediately after avoidance conditioning, escape from the open area with a quick motion to enter into enclosed area appeared when the subject was placed at one end of the open area. Previous work examined the effects of anxiolytic drugs on elevated T-maze, the results suggest two types of anxiety disorder could be distinctly related to conditioned avoidance and escape. However, the mechanisms for those two behaviors in elevated T-maze remain unclear. The present study manipulated the height of maze plate, different forms of wall surrounding enclosed and/or open area, and the width of arms in open area to investigate the anxiogenic stimuli for elevated T-maze. Results indicated that the openness in the open area is the predominant factor for anxiogenesis and, in addition, the impact from height perceived by subject may also be involved. In another experiment the procedures of the two tasks in the elevated T-maze were re-examined and the results excluded the putative confounding effect as derived from different sequences in testing behaviors on this maze. The dose effects of buspirone, known as a serotoninergic anxiolytic drug, were evaluated on elevated T-maze and locomotor activity separately. Buspirone injected with low dose (0.3 mg/kg) significantly reduced the conditioned avoidance latency without affecting the escape latency in elevated T-maze. That locomotor activity was not altered by buspirone given at this dose suggests the irrelevance of anxiolytic effect observed from T-maze with locomotion under drug treatment. Together, results of this study provided evidence in regarding the reliability and validity for using elevated T-maze as an animal model of anxiety in psychopharmacology.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200506-47-2-127-138-a,47.2,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Supervisory Loyalty: Test of Chinese Indigenous Constructs in the United States,"Ding-Yu Jiang, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Chin-Kang Jen, Jean H. Riley","indigenous culture commonality construct, Cross-culture study, organizational commitment, supervisory loyalty, supervisory commitment","Supervisory loyalty (Loyalty to supervisor) is the most significant character in the dyadic relationship between subordinates and supervisors in Chinese Business enterprises. Based on several Chinese indigenous studies including case studies and large-scale questionnaire administrations, researchers have built the constructs and measurement of Chinese supervisory loyalty. In comparison with Western concept, Chinese supervisory loyalty not only has commonality with Western construct, identification and internalization, but also has Chinese indigenous constructs, such as sacrifice and dedication, task assistance, obedience and compliance, and initiative supportiveness. Obviously, the concept of supervisory loyalty is much more comprehensive in Chinese than in Western contexts. One would explain these differences as social culture influences, however, the concept of supervisory commitment, which derived from organizational commitment in Western context, would limit the scope of the concept. As a result, we believe that constructs developed under Chinese context would be also true in Western context and compensate the gap in international literature. For this purpose, cross-culture study using supervisory loyalty scale developed in Chinese context and the content were validated by content validity analysis. Using 160 dyadic samples from the United States and 400 dyadic samples from Taiwan, the results showed that those indigenous supervisory loyalty constructs developed under Chinese context are also valid in the United States, and the relationships between the two constructs of supervisory loyalty-Western and Chinese indigenous commonality, and employee outcomes are similar in most cases among two locations.

The Moderation of Meditation Experience and Emotional Intelligence on the Relationship between Perceived Stress and Negative Mental Health,"Li-Chuan Chu, Henry S. R. Kao","perceived stress, meditation experience, emotional intelligence, negative mental health, meditation","Transactional models of stress (Lazarus, 1976) emphasize the role of individual factors in moderating the stress response. Numerous researches have focused on the role played by individual characteristics, such as Type A Behaviour, Locus of Control, Hardiness and Self-esteem. Ciarrochi, Deane and Anderson (2002) found that emotional intelligence (e.g. managing others' emotions) significantly moderated the link between stress and mental health. How to enhance emotional intelligence, reduce perceived stress and promote physical and psychological wellbeing simultaneously is another important area of research. A substantial amount of research has shown meditation to be beneficial to both the physiological (e.g. alpha activity maintain and less muscle tension) and psychological well-being (e.g. emotional stability and maturity, decreased depression, positive thinking, increased self-confidence). Meditation not only generates the direct effect of relaxation response for one to balance physical and psychological health state, but also the indirect effect of enhancing his physical and psychological well-being conditions by maintaining positive attitude ward perceived stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether meditation experience and emotional intelligence could moderate the relationship between perceived stress and four mental health variables of the GHQ, ie somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and severe depression. Firstly, to explore the relationship among meditation experience, emotional intelligence, perceived stress and negative mental health. Secondly, to examine the difference in emotional intelligence, perceived stress and negative mental health by the variety of meditation experience. Thirdly, to test whether meditation experience, emotional intelligence (e.g. optimism/mood regulation, appraisal of emotions, social skills and utilization of emotions) and perceived stress could predict significantly the level of negative mental health (e.g. somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and (or) severe depression). Finally, to investigate whether meditation experience and emotional intelligence could moderate the relationship between perceived stress and negative mental health. A total of 351 working adults (156 females, 195 men, mean age was 36.83 years, SD=8.28) participated in this cross-sectional study and completed a battery of structured questionnaires, which included measures of meditation experience, the Emotional Intelligence Scale (Schutte et al., 1998), the Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983), and the GHQ-28 Inventory (Chan, 1983, 1985; Goldberg & Hillier, 1979; Shek, 1987, 1988). The data obtained were analyzed with Pearson product-moment correlation, Multivariate ANOVA and Hierarchical Regression. The results show that meditation experience, emotional intelligence, perceived stress and negative mental health were significantly correlated. Greater meditation experience was associated with greater emotional intelligence, lower perceived stress, somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia. Greater emotional intelligence was associated with lower perceived stress, somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression. Greater perceived stress was associated with greater somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction, and severe depression. In addition, it shows that participators, with over five years of meditation experience exhibited higher emotional intelligence (e.g. appraisal of emotions), less perceived stress and better mental health (e.g. less anxiety and insomnia) than those who had no meditation experience. Moreover, regression analyses reveal that meditation experience, emotional intelligence (e.g. optimism/mood regulation, utilization of emotions) and perceived stress all can predict the level of negative mental health (e.g. somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and (or) severe depression) closely. However, the utilization of emotions predicted positively the factors of somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, and severe depression. These findings were different from that of some Western research results. These discrepancies may have resulted from the culture difference between the West and the Chinese. Additionally, meditation experience and emotional intelligence (e.g. optimism/mood regulation, appraisal of emotions, social skills) have been found to effectively moderate the relationship between perceived stress and negative mental health (e.g. anxiety and insomnia). In summary, the most significant findings in this study, which not only have supported Ciarrochi, Deane & Anderson's (2002) previous findings, was that emotional intelligence serves as a moderator in the relationship between stress and negative mental health. In addition, it also revealed that meditation experience was also an effective moderating factor.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200506-47-2-157-179-a,47.2,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology

This study discusses how the maternal meta-emotion philosophy differences affect mothers' interaction with children, and in turn shape children's attachment inclination to them. Structural equation modeling was used to test a hypothetic model and the results revealed a pretty good model fit. Mothers with higher emotion-coaching philosophy benefited children in achieving a more secure attachment, and inhibited inclination of insecure-resistant and insecure-avoidant attachment, whereas mothers with higher emotion-dismissing philosophy were more likely to cause their children to show more insecure-resistant attachment.

Previous studies showing object-based IOR in either dynamic or static displays have used spatially separate stimuli that unavoidably involved spatial representation. It thus remains unclear whether the object-based IOR is a special case limited to the condition in which objects are separated in a 2-dimensional space. To rule out confounding with location-based IOR, we used two overlapping triangles constituting a ”Star of David” in this study to examine whether and under what conditions object-based IOR can be observed. An object cuing paradigm was used in which one of the two triangles was brightened as the cued object. The target was a luminance change in one of the three disks connected to the vertexes of the cued or the uncued triangle. The participants judged whether the target brightened or dimmed. Results show that object-based IOR can occur for spatially overlapping object under two necessary conditions: A long enough cue-to-target SOA and the existence of an attractor that is presented after the cue and before the target.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200503-47-1-1-13-a,47.1,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The ”predictive group” read the stories with supernatural views successfully predict the events, while the ”post-hoc explanation group” with supernatural views offered after the events occurred. The results indicated that there is Post hoc Explanation Bias in responses. That is, contrary to scientific thinking, subjects did not prefer predictions to post hoc explanations. In Experiment 2, another ”implicit predictive group” was added in order to dispel the possibility that the ”predictive views” was taken as self-fulfilling prophecy.

Maternal Sense of Personal Impact and Child Rearing Attitudes toward Cleft Lin and/of Palate Newborns: The Predictability of Two Risk Factors Existing before Delivery,"I-Yuan Liu, Keng-Ling Lay","Cleft lip, Cleft palate, MFP, infant, congenital defect, maternal child rearing attitude","Cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) is one of the most common congenital abnormalities in Taiwan. During pregnancy, expectant mothers often assume that the unborn child is perfect without any flaw or defect. Consequently, as a baby with obvious morphological defect is born, disappointment and feeling of personal failure seems inevitable. The disappointment may not only cause negative personal impact on the mother but also affect her child-rearing attitude toward the CLP infant, which, in turn, may have significant impact on the child's future socioemotional adjustment. The main goal of the present study is to investigate the vicissitude of the affecting factors toward maternal child rearing attitude during the first few months after delivery. The present study adopted a short-term longitudinal approach. Fifty cleft lip/palate newborns' mothers completed questionnaires both before and after the first lip repair surgery held between the third to the fifth month after delivery. Two prenatal factors, maternal perceived early relationship with her own parents that is further separated into two subscales of: acceptance vs. rejection: and: encouragement of independence vs. overprotection:, and maternal functional anticipation of the unborn child while expecting, were measured. Two postpartum maternal adjustment indexes of sense of personal impact over giving birth to CLP infant and child rearing attitude, including subscales of ”acceptance” and ”overprotection”, were also measured. Results indicate that the first repair surgery may trigger qualitative change in child rearing attitude and the variation of prenatal factors that are effective in enhancing maternal adjustment process. It is thus suggested that maternal psychological conditions already existed while or even before expecting should be taken into account in designing the intervention program for mothers of CLP and other types of morphologically defect newborns.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200503-47-1-61-82-a,47.1,2005,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Subliminal priming effect cannot only be an important way to uncover the consciousness and unconsciousness processes, but also bear many empirical applications. Although past research revealed a lot of subliminal priming phenomena, there exist theoretical and technological disagreements still. One major debate is which effect on earth a subliminal affective prime will induce on the subsequent target: affective condition (the affective response to target is assimilated to that to probe) or affective contrast effect (the affective response to target is opposite to that to probe). In this study, participants were asked to watch a video tap embedded with subliminal stimuli displaying a speech made by a stranger and then to make judgments to the speaker. The types of subliminal stimuli included word, animal picture, familiar face, and strange face, in each of which both affectively positive and negative items were included. The results showed that neither words nor animal pictures as subliminal stimuli had effect on the judgments to the speaker and the speech content. However, familiar faces induced affective contrast effect whereas strange faces affective conditioning effect on participants' judgments.

Participants in each dyad viewed an emotion-arousing film and then engaged in a conversation to discuss topics related to the target film. Results indicated, for the self-reported measures, regulators in the suppression condition reported a lower self-regard and a lower satisfaction with the conversation than both the regulators in the reappraisal and the participants in the control condition. For nonverbal behavioral measures, self-touching and bodily movements were significantly less frequent in the suppression condition than those in the control condition. For measures of blood pressure, the elevations of the mean and diastolic blood pressures for the non-regulators in the suppression condition were greater than for the non-regulators in the reappraisal condition. And, the elevation of the systolic blood pressure for the regulators was higher than those for the non-regulators. Taken together, these results suggest that suppressing emotional experience not only had negative impact on those who did the suppression, but also on their partners who interacted with them. In contrast, participants who presumably were experiencing negative emotions could benefit from partners who would offer alternative perspective on the emotion-inducing event. Implications for emotion regulation on interpersonal interactions are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200412-46-4-267-282-a,46.4,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Estimation of Structural Equation Models with Latent Variable Pattern Mixture Model via Stochastic EM Algorithm,"Chung-Ping Cheng, Li-Jen Weng","latent variable, nonignorable missingness, maximum likelihood method, structural equation models, pattern mixture model",The maximum likelihood estimation method using the stochastic EM algorithm was developed for structural equation models (SEM) with latent variable pattern mixture model. Latent variable pattern mixture model is an extension of pattern mixture models with measurement errors and theoretical constructs considered. The patterns of missing were assumed to reflect latent classes rather than categories of manifest variables. Each latent class was allowed to have distinct structural equation model. The results of this simulation study indicated that the proposed estimation method via stochastic EM algorithm performed well compared to other missing data treatment methods and yielded satisfactory parameter estimates.,https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200412-46-4-283-292-a,46.4,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology
"Locus of Control, Supervisory Support and Unsafe Behavior: The Case of Construction Industry in Taiwan","Chien-Chih Kuo, Charng-Cheng Tsaur","unsafe behavior, locus of control, supervisory support","There is a popular notion that workers' unsafe behaviors are the primary causes of workplace accidents, and a number of researchers suggest a perspective that highlights the influences from individual characteristics and situation factors. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of locus of control and supervisory support on unsafe behavior in the workplace. Particularly, we were interesting in individual differences in the impact of perceived supervisory support on unsafe behavior between workers with an internal versus an external locus of control. Data were collected from 1208 workers in construction industry in Taiwan. The results indicated that locus of control were significantly associated with unsafe behaviors. Workers with higher external locus of control appeared higher levels of unsafe behaviors; those with higher internal locus of control appeared lower level of unsafe behavior. In addition, supervisory support was negatively related to unsafe behavior. It seems that when workers perceived their supervisor's support, an implied obligation for job safety develops. Thus, supervisory support had the function to reduce workers' unsafe behavior. Furthermore, supervisory support was found to moderate the relationship between external locus of control and unsafe behavior. For internal locus of control, no moderating effect of supervisory support was found. Finally, theoretical and practical implication of job safety and the possible direction of future research were also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200412-46-4-293-305-a,46.4,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The analyzed data are from 243 Taiwanese families with four members each, including adolescent, father, mother, and one of his/her siblings. The main variables used in this research included children's use of strategies, parents' consent, support provided and received, and family atmosphere. Results indicated that adolescents' and their siblings' patterns could be identified as 'rarely used tactic,' 'indirect moderation' and 'try diversely.' Father's consent patterns could be classified into 'only rationality,' 'prominent authority,' and 'without rejection.' Mother's con-sent patterns could be distinguished into 'only rationality,' 'negotiability' and 'without rejection.' Secondly, the proportions of latent classes and conditional probabilities for a given latent class were significantly different among family members. Further, 'indirect moderation' and 'try diversely' children received more support from parents than those children who 'rarely us tactic.' Finally, the more the parents provided and children received support, the stronger the family warm atmosphere and the weaker the family dejected atmosphere.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200412-46-4-329-347-a,46.4,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology

In order to increase the reliability and validity of internet testing, it is important to understand the factors underlying faking intention. This study examines the effects of test types and situational factors on faking intention. The test types were personality test and biodata. The situational factors were manipulated through the instruction of: (1)testing time limitation(A); (2)warning of lie scale(B); (3)warning of verification(C); (4)the combination of (A) and (B); (5)the combination of (A) and (C); (6)the combination of (B) and (C); (7)the combination of (A), (B) and (C); and (8)control group with no specific instruction. Job Adaptability Personality Inventory (JAPI) was used to assess personality, and biodata were constructed with relative dimensions of JAPI. Faking intention was measured by social desirability scores. Subjects were 1555 job applicants applying for jobs (sales) on the internet. The findings were as follows: The main effects of test types and situational factors were both significant, but there was no significant interaction between these two variables. With respect to testing types, subjects filling biodata tended to have less faking intention than subjects filling personality tests. And with respect to situational conditions, only the combination of warning of lie scale and verification reduced faking intention significantly. In addition, faking intention was positively correlated with the personality test dimension scores. The more testing time subjects used, the more they tended to fake. There were significant differences on faking intention at different age, sex and education level.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200412-46-4-349-359-a,46.4,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology

The first experiment used a masked priming procedure where the prime was either the first, or the second character of a two-character word. We showed that with semantically compositional (”transparent”) words, priming obtained whether the prime was the first or the second constituent. However, when the constituents were not semantically compositional (”opaque”), lexical access was only facilitated when the prime was the first constituent of the word, contradicting the decomposition view. This result was extended in Experiment 2 using a bilingual variation of the same paradigm–the prime was an English word associate of the first or second constituent of a two-character Chinese word. The results also contradicted the predictions of the decomposition hypothesis. In the third experiment, we manipulated cohort size of the first and second constituent, and showed that whereas cohort size modulated access for transparent words, it had no effect for opaque words.

Do Chinese Reader Represent the Emotions of Characters in Narratives?,Mei-Hsiu Chen,"reading comprehension, fictional character, situational model, emotional state","Each of the short experimental stories was intended to induce readers to represent a different emotional state, though each emotional state was implied. After the main body of each story, an additional sentence containing an emotion word was presented as a target sentence. The matching and mismatching words were only opposite in their affective valence (positive vs. negative), and were counterbalanced across stories. The results showed that target sentences with mismatching emotion words were read considerably more slowly. This suggests that although Chinese and English differ in fundamental ways, Chinese readers do also mentally represent characters; emotional states. And compared with the results of Gernsbacher, Goldsmith, and Robertson (1992), Chinese readers are more strongly affected by situational models, including the emotional states of characters.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200406-46-2%263-171-179-a,46.2,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology

We report our investigations of three features of the semantic radical namely character type, consistency and combinability on Chinese character identification. We defined character type as the extent to which the meaning of a whole character is denoted by the semantic radical; consistency as the extent to which a semantic radical consistently represents a specific meaning; and combinability as the total number of characters (tokens) that share the same semantic radical. We found that characters which had the same or similar meaning as the semantic radical it carried were processed more efficiently in semantic categorization and character decision tasks as were characters with high combinability semantic radicals. Consistency effects interacted with other variables.

However, it remains unclear whether the negative meaning affecting the use of bei is derived from sentence-level semantics or merely the verb’s internal connotation. In this study, we selected the 10 most positive verbs, 10 most neutral verbs and 10 most negative verbs among 140 verbs in a pretest. These three types of verbs were then put into three kinds of sentences (positive, neutral, and negative), with the sentences of each type of verb/sentence combination. These 90 sentences were presented to Chinese native speakers, who were asked to score their acceptability. A two-way ANOVA found a highly significant main effect of sentence type on acceptability, but no effect of verb type, and no sentence x verb interaction. Post hoc tests showed that the results were due to high acceptability scores fro sentences with negative connotations.

The results show that the 20% trimmed mean, one step M-estimator and modified one step M-estimator, are good alternatives for comparing two groups based on comparing measure of location. Student's t is the least satisfactory statistic. Also, this study indicates that comparing measures of location provides information only on the typical value of the groups.

"Even Words are Right, Odd Ones are Odd: Explaining Word Segmentation Inconsistency among Chinese Readers","Ruey-Yuan Peng, Jenn-Yeu Chen","word segmentation, Chinese, reading unit","When asked to segment a sentence into words, Chinese readers often show substantial between-individual as well as within-individual inconsistencies. Some researchers have attributed this word segmentation inconsistency to the fact that the character is the stable linguistic unit in the Chinese mental lexicon, and the word is not. Chen (1994) observed that his subjects had a tendency to treat the combination of a monosyllabic word and a disyllabic word as a single word. He characterized this tendency as ”overextension of monosyllabic words,” and suggested it might be the cause of the word segmentation inconsistency. The present study attempted to confirm this observation by means of experiments. The subjects were asked to draw a line between words in several short texts. The critical part of each text consisted of two words which could be paraphrased in two ways: a monosyllabic word and a disyllabic word, or two disyllabic words. Experiment 1 compared the monosyllabe-disyllabe combination with the disyllable-disyllable combination. Experiment 2 compared the disyllable-monosyllable combination with the disyllable-disyllable combination. The results showed that the monosyllabe-disyllabe combination and the disyllable-monosyllable combination did have a higher probability of being treated as a single word than the disyllable-disyllable combination. The Chinese language has evolved into a multi-syllabic language with most words consisting of two syllables/characters. We think the overextension tendency in our subjects' word segmentation behavior reflected the application of their implicit knowledge about this characteristic of the language in an explicit linguistic task that required metalinguistic knowledge. Several early-days Chinese scholars have discussed this tendency before, and Jin Zhao-Zi characterized it the best: ”Even words are right, odd ones are odd.” In line with this view, we conclude that the word is a psychologically real and stable unit in the Chinese mental lexicon and that the reading unit in Chinese should be word.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200403-46-1-49-55-a,46.1,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Effects of Information Type and Thinking Purpose on Dilution Effect,"Chien-Ru Sun, Yi-Ru Lee","typicality, typical diagnosticity, accountability, dilution effect, consider the-opposite, involvement","The dilution effect refers to the phenomenon that when diagnostic information is diluted with nondiagnostic information, our judgment or inference will become less extreme. The present study examined the effects of information type and thinking purpose on the dilution effect.
Experiment 1 aimed at exploring the possible impact of different nondiagnostic information types on the dilution effect. We manipulated typicality and typical diagnosticity of the nondiagnostic information independently. Seventy-eight subjects were randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: (1) the undiluted condition: receiving diagnostic information only, (2) the dilution condition: receiving diagnostic information and nondiagnostic information which is typical and low in typical diagnosticity, (3) the dilution condition: receiving diagnostic information and nondiagnostic information which is atypical and low in typical diagnosticity, (4) the dilution condition: receiving diagnostic information and nondiagnostic information which is typical and high in typical diagnosticity, (5) the dilution condition: receiving diagnostic information and nondiagnostic information which is atypical and high in typical diagnosticity. The results indicated that when the typical diagnosticity of the information is high, then regardless of the typicality, the dilutuion effect occurred. On the other hand, we also found that if the information is typical, then no matter the typical diagnosticity is high or low, the dilution effect also appeared. In other words, the nondiagnostic information, only when it is atypical and low in typical diagnosticity, would have no impact on our judgment.
Experiment 2 was focused on the effects of thinking purpose on the dilution effect. Subjects were randomly assigned to a 6 (thinking purpose: value-relevant involvement vs. consider-the-opposite vs. explaining to others vs. impression-relevant involvement vs. being unbiased vs. none)×2 (information condition: undiluted vs. diluted) factorial design.

Leadership Prototypes and Performance Perceptions,"Wei-Ling Hsu, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","implicit leadership theory, leadership prototypes, inferential processes, recognized-based processes, performance perceptions","According to implicit leadership theory (ILT), people have personal theories of leadership in their mind and tend to use their own theories to label and judge leaders. Based on ILT and past research, Lord (1985) developed a social information processing model to describe two types of process- the recognized-based processes and the inferential process- to illustrate leadership perceptions. On the basis of implicit leadership theory and Lord's leadership perception model, this study examined followers' perceptions of supervisors and top leaders. A total of 150 employees who were from 8 local high- tech companies participated in the survey.
The results indicated that followers' group performance perceptions had a significant effect on supervisory- prototype congruence, and followers' organizational performance perceptions also had a significant effect on top leader- prototype congruence. The results as well revealed that degree of ascription was a moderator in the relationship between group performance perception and supervisor-prototype congruence.
Moreover, the results confirmed the predications that perceiving supervisors was different from perceiving top leaders. When perceiving supervisors, subordinates were able to observe and interact with their supervisors frequently, and therefore it was easy to compare the leaders with their preexisting leadership prototypes and use the results of the comparisons as well as the group performance information to judge the leaders; therefore, followers' group performance perceptions and supervisor-prototype congruence impacted leadership effectiveness concurrently. On the other hand, followers rarely interacted with their top leaders; when they evaluated their top leaders, they had to seek outside information such as the performance of the companies to form their image and make the assessments, and the result was that organizational performance perception had an indirect effect on leadership effectiveness by the mediation of topleader-prototype congruence. The theoretical and practical implications of these finding are discussed accordingly.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200403-46-1-75-89-a,46.1,2004,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Effects of Missing Data Treatments and Model Specification on Fit Indices in Structural Equation Modeling,"Chung-Ping Cheng, Li-Jen Weng","missing data, fit index, structural equation modeling","This Monte Carlo study explored effects of missing data treatment and model specification on 8 recommended fit indices in structural equation modeling. The results indicated that the structured maximum likelihood method tended to overestimate the degree of model-data fit, and the degree of overfitting increased as the percentage of missing data increased. Overfitting was not observed with unstructured maximum likelihood method, although this method tended to reject the model too often when the model was correctly specified. None of the fit index or missing data treatment was found to be superior across all conditions. The power of Gamma hat and Mc was found to be low.

Interference and Inhibition of Distractors,"Hsuan-Fu Chao, Yei-Yu Yeh, Ting-Ying Yang","interference, negative priming, inhibitory process","The relationships among distractor activation, distractor interference, and distractor inhibition were investigated through a negative priming paradigm. Two issues were addressed in this study. First, the authors studied the relationship between distractor activation and distractor interference, to see what kind of distractors can produce a larger interference effect on target processing. Second, the effect of prime distractor interference and probe distractor interference on negative priming were examined, to see whether negative priming is contingent on distractor interference. In Experiment 1, assuming that the activation level of an item increases as it is repeatedly presented in one experimental session, the authors orthogonally manipulated activation level of prime target and prime distractor to be either high or low. The results indicate that distractor can produce a larger interference effect when it is in the same activation state as the target is. That is, when target and distractor are both in a state of high activation or both in a state of low activation, the distractor interference effect on target processing is larger. Furthermore, negative priming is significant only when both prime distractor interference and probe distractor interference are large. Experiment 2 and Experiment 3 manipulated the activation level of prime target and probe distractor, and confirmed that negative priming manifests only when interference from both prime distractor and probe distractor is high. This study reveals how the interaction between activation level of target and activation level of distractor influences the dynamics of distractor interference, and indicates that interference in both prime trials and probe trials is critical to the manifestation of negative priming. Implications on models of negative priming are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200312-45-4-361-377-a,45.4,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Scheduling of Mental Processes in the Stroop Task with Critical Path Method,"Min-Sheng Chen, Jenn-Yeu Chen","stroop, S-R compatibility, serial, CPM, wheatstone bridge","Schweickert (1983) employed the Critical Path Method (CPM) to study the mental processes underlying the Stroop task. In both the color naming and the word naming tasks, the participants were asked to make two responses, the manual one to the irrelevant dimension and the vocal one to the relevant dimension. The manual response was always to be issued first. The author found that in the color naming task, the word was processed first, whereas in the word naming task, the color was processed first. The results were taken as a challenge to the major account of the Stroop effect, which maintains that the word is automatically processed first.
We hypothesized that Schweickert's results were due to the author's artificially imposing the manual-first response order in their participants. To test this hypothesis, we first replicated Schweickert's experiments using the same procedures (Exp. 1 & 2). Next, we repeated the same experiment, but leaving the participants to decide on their preferred response order (Exp. 3 & 4). The results obtained from Exp. 1 and 2 were similar to Schweickert's. By contrast, the results of Exp. 3 and 4 showed that the word was always processed first regardless of the task. It was also found whether the dual processes took the form of a serial order or of a Wheatstone Bridge depended on the difficulty of each task and their combination. Specifically, when both tasks were easy, a serial process seemed to be in effect, whereas when one of the processes was hard enough, the coordination of the two process turned into the form of a Wheatstone Bridge.

Different Effects of Level-of-Processing and Self-Generation in Implicit Tests,Chao-Ming Cheng,"level-of-processing and generation effects in implicit tests, post-test dissociation procedure, dissociation of memory in implicit tests","Three experiments were conducted to assess effects of level-of-processing and self-generation on conscious and unconscious components of memory within an implicit test of word-stem completion. The two components of memory were dissociated by a post-test dissociation procedure. Equations for estimating these two components of memory are formulated by excluding recognition memory that is irrelevant to repetition priming and guessing effects from estimates of memory contributing to completion. Results of Experiments 1 and 3 show that level-of-processing produced a positive effect on overall completion associated with a positive effect on the estimate of conscious memory and a null effect on the estimate of unconscious memory. This pattern of results was due to repetition-priming effects on both estimates of conscious and unconscious memories under the two levels of processing. Re-suits of Experiments 2 and 3 show that generation produced a null effect on overall completion, accompanied by a positive effect on the estimate of conscious memory and a reverse effect on the estimate of unconscious memory. This pattern of results was due to a repetition-priming effect on the estimate of conscious memory under each study condition and a repetition-priming effect under the shallow and a repetition-inhibition effect under the generation condition on the estimate of unconscious memory.

Yet the underlying competitive mechanisms are still not clear. In two experiments, the cue-to-distractor stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) and spatial distance between cued and distractor locations were manipulated. Following a central cue, an abrupt flash occurred in any location that was never centrally cued. Using EOG electrodes to monitor eye movements, the reaction times to identification of the target were measured. For more than 200 ms cue-to-distractor SOA, the nearest distractor produced the largest interruption (Experiment 1). In contrast, for 84 ms cue-to-distractor SOA, the farthest distractor produced the largest interruption (Experiment 2).

Effects of Lithium Chloride Induced Reward Devaluation on Two Types of Spatial Behavior of the Taxon System,"Jian-You Lin, Ruey-Ming Liao","radial eight-armmaze, cue learning, association learning, egocentric, rat, behavioral component","In order to investigate the potential differences between the spatial behavior derived from the guidance and the orientation hypotheses in the taxon system (O’Keefe & Nadel, 1978), the present study examined the behavioral performance in the radial eight-arm maze in rats under lithium chloride (LiCl) devaluation and context stimulus alteration. Food-deprived rats were separately trained to perform in the cue-learning and egocentric tasks in maze. The cue-learning task required the subject to enter two randomly chosen (out of eight) arms each cued with a piece of sandpaper on the arm entrance. When only four arms were used, the egocentric task required the subject to start from the end of a randomly chosen arm and turned into a baited arm with a specific direction of 90° . After reaching the baseline level, behavioral measures on two tasks were conducted first under the response probe test of the context stimulus alteration and followed by the LiCl devaluation procedure. Removal of sandpaper significantly enhanced the time the rat stayed on the central platform of the maze before entering the arms in the cue-learning task. In contrast, performance on the egocentric task remained intact when the starting point was shifted. The incentive value of the reinforcer baited in the maze was clearly reduced by the LiCl devaluation procedure. This manipulation significantly impaired performance on the egocentric task by decreasing the percent of correct choice and increasing the time to complete the task. In contrast, the performance on cue-learning task was not affected by LiCl devaluation. Together, these data indicate that the rats acquire the cue-learning and egocentric tasks based on the learning associations of stimulus-response (S-R) and response-reinforcement (R-S*), respectively. It is suggested that the guidance and orientation can be the two hypothetical strategies the different spatial behaviors in the taxon system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200309-45-3-243-262-a,45.3,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology

This study tested resources loss or coping that influence people’ psychological symptoms. Based on COR, resources loss should strongly predict psychological symptoms, but Benight et al., (1999) and Zeidner and Hammer (1992) suggested coping will directly influence psychological symptoms. This study also examined how different kinds of resources loss affected coping measures one uses, and social support and psychological symptoms. Three hundred and fifty four subjects were interviewed in this study, including 240 stayed in shelter, and 114 living in the same home before earthquake. Correlation results of this study support the hypothesis of conservation of resources theory, (i. e., resources loss affects the subject’s psychological symptoms). “Expected support from external agency” and “avoidance coping” also significantly correlated with psychological symptoms.

Based upon conceptual framework adapted from other traditional addiction disorders such as pathological gambling and substance addictions, the tendency of Internet addiction was characterized with two aspects of behavioral manifestation: ie., core symptoms and related problems. In study 1, the original items of the CIAS depicting core symptoms and related problems of Internet addiction were generated through focused interview and derived from the diagnostic criteria of other well-defined addiction disorders. The CIAS, background questionnaire eliciting data on basic demographics, weekly on-line hours, habitual domains, and experience of Internet utilization were administered in a traditional paper and pencil manner to a random sample of National Taiwan University students (N = 1336). Factor analysis, correlation analysis, and t-test were utilized to analyze the data. Results show that: The CIAS is an appealing and reliable test with satisfactory test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Correlation analyses yield significant positive correlation of total scale and subscale scores of CIAS with weekly Internet hours, but not with experience of Internet utedilization. Moreover, high-risk students show different attitudes toward Internet use and addiction from normal students. In study 2, the CIAS-R, with modification of item wording as well as addition and elimination of some items, were administered to another sample of random subjects at the National Taiwan University (N = 1975). Same procedure and analyses were applied. It resulted in a better factor structure with similarly satisfactory psychometric properties.

Based on our theoretical analyses of the Chinese concept of face, three hypotheses are proposed: (1) Senior citizens are more sensitive to face episodes related f to their ascribed status in intimate society (i.e., their seniority as parents to their children within the family), while university students are more sensitive to face episodes related to their s achieved status in operative society (i.e., their academic performance as students in the university). (2) Compared with university students, senior citizens are more sensitive to face episodes caused by significant others. (3) Both senior citizens and university students are concerned about maintenance of their moral face. Three empirical studies were conducted to test these hypotheses. Qualitative data about face episodes collected in Study I supported all three hypotheses. Paired comparison tasks in Study 2 showed that senior citizens experience face through morality and achievement of their children, while university students are more sensitive to face episodes related to personal achievement and morality. Both groups felt loss of face for negative episodes of personal morality. In Study 3 participants evaluated their feelings toward a scenario of being publicly blamed by different social targets.

The Best Measure of the Accuracy of Metacognitive Monitoring: Measures Determining the Consistency and Generality of Metacognition,"En-Ping Liang, Ju-Whei Lee","Metacognitive monitoring, Domain-general ability, Domain-specific ability, Stability, Confidence-judgment accuracy paradigm","The Goodman-Kruskal gamma correlation coefficient (denoted as G) was evaluated by Nelson (1984) as the best measure for assessing the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring. Consequently, it was widely adopted by many researchers in the field of metacognition. Recently, some researchers found that the value of the G measure could not accurately reflect the individual's metacogntion (Schwartz & Metcalfe, 1994), it varied with item difficulty (Weaver & Bryant, 1995), and it was unstable within a single domain (Thompson & Mason, 1996). Meanwhile, some scholars used the mean probability score, bias, the calibration index, the discrimination index, and the adjusted normalized discrimination index (denoted separately as PS, Bias, CI, DI, and ANDI) to evaluate a subject's accuracy of metacognitive monitoring. (e.g., Koriat & Goldsmith, 1996; Maki, 1998; Schraw, Dunkle, Bendixen, & Roedel, 1995). With these vaiours measures, one enigmatic issue concerns which measure best reflects the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring. In constructing a test, one needs to establish the validity and the reliability of that test. Same conceptions apply to the measures of metacognitive monitoring. From the viewpoint of definitions and mathematical formulas, it is apparent that each of thest existing measures possesses construct validity. Nevertheless, few studies examined thoroughly the reliability of these measures. The present study, thus, empirically compared the stability of these six measures in terms of three criteria: The stability across item difficulty, the stability within a single domain, and the stability across domains
Three experiments, each with a single factor design (item difficulty: easy/medium/difficult), were conducted to assess the stability of these six measures. Fifty-nine college students repeatedly participated in three experiments. Although these experiments belonged to different domains (the word recognition test, the face recognition test, and the general knowledge test), they all adopted the confidence-judgment accuracy paradigm to measure the subject's accuracy of metacognitive monitoring. The experiments of word recognition and face recognition were conducted on IBM-compatible PCs. Each of these two experiments began by asking participants to memorize a set of items, then followed by a two-alternative recognition test. As to the general knowledge experiment, it was a one-stage recognition test. For each recognition item, regardless of the experiment, the subject had to choose the correct answer from the two alternatives, then gave a confidence rating (in the range of 50% to 100%) for the chosen answer to be regarded as correct.
For each experiment, the values of PS, Bias, CI, DI, ANDI, and G were computed. A Kruskal- Wallis test was then conducted to examine the effect of item difficulty on each of those measures. The Spearman correlation of each index was computed from split-halves of each test to evaluate the stability of each index in a single domain. Spearman correlations were also computed among experiments to reflect stability across domains. Results from the experiments showed that the values of the ANDI and G did not change with item difficulty. Those of PS, Bias, CI, and DI were stable within a domain. The values of PS, Bias, CI, and DI showed stability across domains. In conclusion, none of the examined measures was an entirely stable measure for the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a new stable measure to assess the accuracy of metacognitive monitoring. In addition, results from various measures (PS, Bias, CI, and DI) indicated stability over time and among tasks, implying the existence of a general and consistent metacognitive ability. The present study, thus, suggests that previous controversy about the nature of the metacognitive ability is partly due to different measures.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200306-45-2-121-138-a,45.2,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Experiment 2 investigated LoP effects on automatic memory in the test estimated by a modified version of the process-dissociation procedure and on that estimated from performance on an indirect version of the test. Consistent with conventional indirect studies, results of Experiment 2 showed a positive effect of LoP on automatic memory.

LoP effects in Experiments 3 and 4 were the same as those in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively.

Is There an Isolation Effect? Effects of Asset Comparability in Decision-Making under Risk,Yao-Chu Chiu,"asset comparability, relative asset, isolation effects, loss tolerance, prospect theory","Kahneman and Tversky (1979, 2000) argued that what influences a decision most are not the final asset but the change of wealth. According to their interpretation, in most cases it is the status quo, rather than the final asset, that serves as the reference point. The isolation effect (IE) occurs as a consequence of information about the asset being isolated from the current situations. Kahneman and Tversky further highlights the importance of the classification of current decision outcomes; when the outcomes are classified as ”positive (for example, gains)”, decision makers tend to be risk-averse. They become risk-seeking when decision outcomes are classified as ”negative (for example, losses)”. This article, however, contends that the cause of this differentiated attitude is actually the comparability of the asset. Since isolation arises because subjects oftentimes are not able to classify asset information in choice situations.
Distinction between the relative asset and the absolute asset is then made; asset in the presence of compared stimulus is relative, rather than absolute. Traditional IE experiments present no compared stimulus rendering the asset absolute, as a result the asset can have no impacts on the choice, hence the isolation effects. In the case of compared stimulus which makes asset relative, information about the asset can be classified into meaningful categories such as ”less” or ”more”, which then proceeds to impact the choice.
Two experiments reported in this article have been designed to examine asset comparability. Experiment one uses absolute asset as the control condition (separation tasks), and in the experimental condition comparative information is provided (joint tasks). The separation task presents information about one asset. However in the joint task, information about several assets is presented simultaneously (for example, both NT $1,000 and NT $2,000 are introduced). Results show that although the given asset for both tasks is the same, only in the joint task condition could one classify the given asset as ”less” or ”more”. In experiment two, the asset is given in classified terms such as ”poor” or ”rich”. Subjects are predicted to take into consideration such classification and demonstrate risk-averse attitude when the asset is classified as ”less” or ”poor”, while they become risk-seeking when the asset is classified as “more” or ”rich”. The isolation effect is observed in the separation task condition in experiment one, which replicates the Kahneman and Tversky finding. However isolation effect was not found in the joint task conditions for both Experiment one and Experiment two. Instead, when the asset has been classified as ”more” or ”rich”, subjects showed risk-seeking or neutral attitude, whereas risk-averse or neutral attitude was observed when the asset was classified as ”less” or ”poor”. This result is inconsistent with the findings of traditional IE studies, yet in general supports the conception of asset comparability. Findings of this article suggest that Isolation Effect is an exception rather than a norm in decision situations, that is, the isolation effect stands fast only in cases of absolute asset where compared stimulus is not available.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200306-45-2-157-170-a,45.2,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Is There a Framing Effect? The Asset Effect in Decision-Making under Risk,Yao-Chu Chiu,"Asset effects, isolation effects, invariance axiom., prospect theory, framing effects","Tversky and Kahneman (1981; Kahneman & Tversky, 2000) postulated that when a decision task is described as ”positive” or ”life-saving”, subjects tend to be risk-averse in their choice; however, when the task is described as ”negative” or ”life-threatening”, subjects tend to be risk-seeking in their choice. Objectively the task remains the same in both cases, nevertheless different descriptions often result in different risk attitudes -- this is known as framing effect. This article asserts that a decision-maker's asset level affects the choice more than the framing of the task does. Two experiments are reported to support this view.
In experiment one an ”Asian financial crisis” task was constructed. In Experiment two, Tversky and Kahneman’s Asian disease task was adopted for comparison. Both tasks involved two levels of asset (NT$ 6 million versus NT$ 60 billion in the Asian financial crisis task; 600 people versus 6 million people in the Asian disease task). The results of the Asian financial crisis task show that subjects tend to be risk-seeking when the asset level is high, but they tend to become risk-averse when the asset level is low. The Asian disease task reports similar results -- subjects tend to be risk-seeking when the asset level is high, and risk-averse or neutral when the asset level is low. These results suggest that it is the asset level, rather than the framing of the task, which eventually affects the decision when an asset effect (AE) is exposed.
Furthermore, relationships among the framing effect, the isolation effect and the reflection effect (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) are clarified. The clarification could help experimenters to understand more clearly the potential impact that AE may have on framing. AE indicates that given the same amount of loss, a decision-maker with a higher asset level can take on more risks since the loss can be tolerated better than one with a lower asset level. This suggests that threshold for risk and loss becomes higher when the asset level increases, while tolerance for risk and loss drops as the asset level drops. We can thus predict that those with high asset level tend to be risk-seeking while those with low asset level risk-averse.
A further implication is evidenced by the two experiments conducted -- when the information of the asset levels is manipulated, framing will have a limited impact on the final decision.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200306-45-2-171-182-a,45.2,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Modeling Streamlining of Ambiguity Effect in Decisional Process,"Shyhnan Liou, Jong-Tsun Huang, Chung-Ping Cheng","Degree of ambiguity, Ambiguity attitude, Ambiguity effect, Streamlining mechanism.","The present study tries to validate the dual mechanisms of ambiguity effect in decisional process. Dual mechanisms operate in a streamlining way when a decision maker is uncertain of the occurrence probability of certain events. The ambiguity thus incurred modulates the estimation of event probability (P-mechanism or Streamline 1) and that of event consequence (U-mechanism or Streamline2). We propose the existence of the streamlining of dual mechanisms, and argue that these two mechanisms are both influenced by perceived degree of ambiguity and attitude toward ambiguity. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model to express these mechanisms. Based on the proposed streamlining mechanisms, two experiments were conducted to test three hypotheses derived from the revised model: (1) existence of the 'degree of perceived ambiguity' effect; (2) existence of the 'ambiguity attitude' effect; and (3) existence of the streamlining of dual mechanisms. The experimental results are in general agreement with the three hypotheses. Our demonstrations thus clearly complement the single-mechanism (i.e., P or U-mechanism, but not both in a streamlining way) explanations in the literature. The present study follows a substantial revision of Lattimore et al's (1992) model to separate and to accommodate the effects of 'degree of perceived ambiguity' and 'ambiguity attitude'. The revised Liou model (Liou, 1998) was then used to simulate the behavior of P- and U-mechanisms under various combinations and values. By comparing Liou model with other ambiguity models in data-fitness and parameter sensitivity, which proposed by Einhorn & Hogarth (1985), Kahn & Sarin (1988), and Lattimore et al (1992).The test results showed that Liou's model is the best functional form in modeling P and U mechanism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200306-45-2-183-205-a,45.2,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology

Prelexical Phonology by Low Spatial Frequency Channels?,"Su-Ling Yeh, Hsiao-Chueh Chang, I-Ping Chen, Chia-Ying lee","Idiom judgment, Prelexical phonology, Chinese character recognition, Homophone, Orthography, Phonology, Spatial frequency channels","Whether prelexical phonology exists in a logographic script such as Chinese has long been debated. In contrast to English, there is no explicit grapheme-phoneme correspondence rule for Chinese characters, which makes the idea of prelexical phonology seemingly implausible. To provide a logical basis for prelexical phonology in Chinese character recognition, Chua (1999) proposed two independent routes for Chinese character recognition: one through phonology that is carried by low spatial frequencies, and the other through a lexicon that is carried by high spatial frequencies. The low frequency channels can be activated earlier than the high frequency ones, so the global shape of a character provides the phonological information even before the full identification of the character is possible. In this study, a verification paradigm using four-character idioms was adopted to test Chua's low spatial-frequency mediated phonology model. Three characters of each four-character idiom were presented first, followed by four kinds of foils designed factorially of orthography (similar, dissimilar) × homophone (yes, no). The accuracy in rejecting orthographically similar or homophonic foils was found lower than their controls when the foils were unfiltered (Experiment 1). The homophone effect was not consistently found when the foils contained only low spatial frequency information (Experiment 2); it was found when low spatial frequency information was absent (Experiment 3); and it was also found when only a middle range of spatial frequencies was intact (Experiment 4). In contrast, the orthography effect was found consistently in all 4 experiments. These results argue against the low-spatial-frequency mediated phonology.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200303-45-1-11-27-a,45.1,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Regularity and Consistency Effects in Chinese Character Naming,"In-Mao Liu, Sau-chin Chen, Iue-ruey Sue","Regularity effects, Spelling-sound correspondences, Consistency effects, Radical-sound correspondences, Pronunciation by retrieval, Chinese character naming","In alphabetic languages, the consistency in spelling-sound correspondences is defined by the neighborhood size of similarly spelled words (i.e., with the same word-body) with the same pronunciation. It is sometimes defined in terms of grapheme-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules. There is no dispute as to how to define regularity and consistency in Chinese, because both are defined in terms of phonetic radicals (phonetics), which are comparable to word-bodies in alphabetic languages. Depending on the radical-sound relationship, three dimensions of consistency in radical-sound correspondences may be defined. Three types of irregularity may be defined: heterophonous, non-phonetic, and non-homophonous. The existence of separate dimensions of consistency makes it possible to pit consistency against various types of regularity. It was found that the consistency effect generally appears in naming latencies and that the regularity effect appears in naming errors. Since the large majorities of naming errors represent retrieval errors, it is reasoned that alternative pronunciations compete at the time of retrieval rather than during processing in naming a target character. The regularity effect as showing a tendency to make more errors for irregular than for regular characters signifies that pronounceable/compatible phonetics may aid the acquisition of regular characters in people's early childhood.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200303-45-1-29-46-a,45.1,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Basic Orthographic Units in Children's Recognition of Chinese Characters,Wen-chi Chiang,"Stroke-patterns, Chinese character recognition, Beginning reader, Number of strokes, Orthographic units","Two experiments were conducted to investigate the basic orthographic units used by the fifth graders in character recognition: Experiment 1 used a simultaneous ‘same-different’ comparison task; Experiment 2 used a character-decision task. The current study modeled after S. Chen and Liu's (2000) study with adults. The results of their study showed that simultaneous comparisons of pairs of Chinese characters were influenced by the stroke-patterns (SPs), not the individual strokes, that comprised the characters. That is, the larger was the number of SPs, the longer was the response latency; however, this pattern was restricted to the 'same' judgments for high-frequency character pairs. By contrast, in the ‘different’ judgments and in the character-decision task, the effect of stroke number was found instead, suggesting that the effect of SPs observed in the ‘same’ judgments might result from specific task-demands for making simultaneous comparisons. In the current study, children’s performance on the ‘same-different’ judgment task (Experiment 1) showed a pattern similar to the found in adults, but their performance on the character-decision task showed a different pattern (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 2 showed that the child participant’s character decision responses to low-frequency characters were affected by the number of strokes, but a trend of the SP-number effect was also found although it was not robust – it was significant only in the subject, not in the item analysis. One explanation of these results was that the fifth graders flexible used either individual strokes or SPs in character recognition, depending on the testing context. However, a further inspection of the stimulus characters used in Experiment 2 suggested that the trend of SP-number effect might be apparent and resulted from mismatch in a character-based visual attribute, the visual-density distribution (as can be indicated by visual complexity of the character’s right-side radical), between the stimuli used for contrasting SP conditions. Post hoc analyses of the responses to a selected subset of stimuli (matched in the visual complexity of the characters’ right-side radical) revealed a pattern consistent with this proposal. The pattern of current results is thus more consistent with the view that individual strokes function as the basic orthographic units in children’s recognition of Chinese characters. Implications of the current findings are discussed with respect to the existing theoretical framework for, and to the development of, character recognition processes.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200303-45-1-47-74-a,45.1,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Chinese Orthographic Priming in Lexical Decision and Naming,"Jei-Tun Wu, Hsin-Chin Chen","Frequency effect, Character naming, Lexical access, Prelexical phonology, Character frequency, Character recognition, Orthographic prime inhibition, Neighborhood frequency effect","Accompanied with the reliable facilitation effect of semantic (instead of homophonic) priming on character recognition and naming found in previous research, it was also observed that priming with orthographically similar characters inhibits recognition and naming of targets. The first two experiments manipulated prime character frequency, orthographic similarity, and SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony) in lexical decision and naming tasks. In the lexical decision task, the target characters which were preceded by an unmasked, orthographically similar prime of higher frequency were responded to slower than their dissimilar pair controls with SOAs of 50 ms and 500 ms. A similar inhibition effect was also observed in the naming task. When the SOA duration was extended to 1000 ms in Experiment 2, a significant inhibition effect was observed not only under conditions with primes of higher frequency but also with primes of lower frequency. In Experiment 3, pseudo-character primes were included. It was found that pseudo-character primes obtained no effect upon target recognition while manifesting a small inhibition effect on target naming under the prime exposure duration of 500 ms. In Experiment 4, an additional prime condition of free radicals in isolation was included. It was found in Experiment 4 that with the SOA of 50 ms or 500 ms, the embedded right component radical in isolation facilitated the recognition of the target character embedding it, while not exerting any effect on character naming.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200303-45-1-75-95-a,45.1,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
The Word Priority Effect in Remembering Chinese Characters,"Yuh-Shiow Lee, Han-yu Lin","Chinese radicals, Frequency effect, Recognition memory","The word priority hypothesis proposes that words should be pronounced faster, recognized and remembered better than the embedded words. The presents study investigated one aspect of this hypothesis – words are remembered better than the embedded words. The recognition memory paradigm was used to examine the role of the embedded characters (the radicals) in remembering Chinese characters. The results from two experiments showed that when participants studied characters and were later tested recognition memory for radicals, they performed worse than when were tested for characters. In addition, when the study items were characters, there was no effect of radical frequency. However, a clear effect of character frequency was found. These finding suggested that radicals did not play an important role in remembering characters and thus were consistent with the word priority hypothesis.

Masked Priming of the Syllable in Mandarin Chinese Speech Production,"Jenn-Yeu Chen, Wei-Chun Lin, Ludovic Ferrand","Speech production, Chinese, syllable","The syllable’s role in Chinese (Mandarin) speech production was investigated using masked syllable priming combined with a word naming task. In three experiments, the prime (shown in the form of a Chinese character but masked) shared the first few segments with the beginning of the disyllabic target word. The segmental overlap either corresponded to a syllable or it did not. Aside from a neutral prime, there were two types of related primes: a CV (e.g., ba3) or a CVG (e.g., bay3) syllable, and two types of targets: a CV-GV (e.g., ba4-ye4) or a CVG-CVX (e.g., bay4-ley4) word, where numbers stand for tones. In Experiment 1, when the prime-target overlap corresponded to a syllable, the tones and the orthographies were also the same (i.e., the overlap in effect corresponded to the entire character). In Experiment 2, the syllable overlap included the tone but not the orthography. In Experiment 3, the syllable overlap was restricted to the syllable only, the tone and the orthography being different. A crossover interaction of the prime by target type was observed not only in Exp. 1 but also in Exp. 2 and Exp. 3, the effect being larger in Exp. 1 and about the same in Exps. 2 and 3. The crossover interaction effects from the last two experiments support the view that the syllable (lacking the tone) is a stored phonological chunk and plays an independent role as a planning unit in Chinese word production.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10139656-200303-45-1-107-120-a,45.1,2003,Chinese Journal of Psychology
Stay Out of Politics: Constructing a Psychological Site for Transitional Justice,Jenyu Peng,"transformative repair, transitional justice, psychological healing, political trauma, transgenerational trauma","After more than 40 years of authoritarian rule in Taiwan, the KMT regime's full impact on society as a whole is yet to be fully understood. The direct and intergenerational trauma due to the political violence and its aftermath suffered by the victims and their families has not been thoroughly examined. Based on ethno-psychoanalytic fieldwork, as well as governmental experience as a commissioner at the Transitional Justice Commission (TJC) in Taiwan, I argue that political trauma at both the individual and collective levels should be confronted within an integrative transdisciplinary framework. The field of Transitional Justice (TJ) first emerged in the 1990s with a focus on the legal and institutional reforms required to usher in the process of democratization. In the first decade of the 21^(st) century, TJ underwent a paradigm shift towards a multidimensional social project, encompassing legal, historical, political, psychological, and cultural transformation. I examined the international literature on TJ, notably case studies in different regions, and observed abounding psychological implications in diverse TJ projects, ranging from trauma rehabilitation, truth (re-)construction, accountability of the perpetrators, and social coexistence and reconciliation between antagonistic groups. However, these implications need to be further explored. At present, the majority of TJ projects envisage psychological interventions solely as complementary instruments to rehabilitate the victimized, often through a medical lens in terms of mental health. The limited role imagined for psychologists may be inherited from the psychotherapeutic experience and knowledge of Holocaust survivors' trauma and transgenerational repercussions. I indicate 3 major TJ themes with ramifications that may be delineated with the aid of psychology subdisciplines: (1) the relation between truth-telling and trauma healing; (2) the implementation of (inter-)national restoration measures in local contexts; and (3) the tension between ensuring accountability and searching for reconciliation. Firstly, in most TJ discourses, the link between truth-telling and healing is often oversimplified to serve political purposes. Psychoanalytic reflection on the psychological configurations allowing the narrator to explore multiple layers of truth has not been integrated into debates around TJ projects, leading to a sterile opposition between speaking or not speaking. Secondly, although the UN has established basic principles and guidelines to remedy and repair the unfathomable loss and trauma endured by victims of gross human rights violations, their implementation in different countries varies according to socio-economic and political conditions. The incommensurability of trauma suffered by survivors is rarely debated; restoration measures are mostly reduced to monetary compensation. Several researchers have pointed out the top-down tendencies and the neglect of specific local contexts as the main obstacles to forming a sound and effective TJ policy. Thirdly, ensuring accountability is often presumed to obstruct reconciliation. However, political and social psychologists have found that most members of victim groups are willing to reconcile when individual perpetrators are duly punished and the harm properly compensated. An authentic reconciliation presupposes a radical transformation of the opposing inner narratives and social ideologies of antagonistic groups, and the formation of a fusion of horizons. The second part of the article examines the actualities of TJ in Taiwan from the perspective of these 3 themes. Since the KMT, the ruling party during the authoritarian regime, continued to reign for more than a decade after the lifting of martial law, its legacies are omnipresent in both the public and private spheres. The current version of the KMT still fiercely denies the reality of the political suppression, resulting in the belated official acknowledgement of February 28th Incident and the 40-year-long White Terror; moreover, most survivors and perpetrators have now passed away, rendering the reconstruction of historical truth extremely laborious. The attempts to reveal perpetrators' wrongdoing still provoke anxiety and conflict among social groups along polarized political lines. For many generations, mental health practitioners, including clinical psychologists, were advised to ""stay out of politics"" to maintain ""professional neutrality"". In the public sphere, truth-telling often encounters either indifference or resentment from those eager to look ahead and bury the past, or the tendency of extremists in the independence movement to reduce the multifaceted truth to oversimplified narratives of victimization or heroic hagiography. Regarding restoration measures, monetary compensation was for a long time the only imaginable way for lawmakers and survivors to redress the extrajudicial killing and imprisonment suffered by around 20,000 (according to official records) political prisoners. The severe long-term psychological sequelae, such as the loss of basic trust and sense of self-integrity and all derived symptoms, were either totally neglected or treated as individual weaknesses to be consigned to psychiatric care. Nevertheless, the consequences of political trauma, including transgenerational trauma, are evident in survivors' autobiographies and oral historians' publications. Unfortunately, as the government decision makers lacked a trauma-informed sensibility, mental health professionals were not solicited to participate in the policymaking process until the inauguration of the TJC in May 2018. Political trauma and healing being a brand-new issue in Taiwan, it is imperative to provide proper training to practitioners in different branches of the helping professions, and to invent a substantial interdisciplinary network capable of creating reassuring relationships with traumatized survivors and their families, and of preparing them and their communities for reintegration. The search for accountability as a necessary step towards reconciliation (to which most survivors aspire) remains a difficult ideal to achieve, especially since more than 5 million voters still support a KMT that continues to claim the ferocious suppression was a necessary evil in the context of civil war against the Chinese Communist Party. Although the stigmatizing attitude towards former political prisoners has diminished considerably, KMT politicians still resist all TJ endeavors to seek accountability, accusing them of being instrumentalized for purely political ends. Holistic TJ projects require multidisciplinary collaboration in multidimensional enterprises so as to build an imagined community based on a new set of shared values, such as human rights, the rule of law, and democracy. This collaboration implies not only system reform, but also psychological, cultural, and social transformation. Therefore, an authentic healing of political trauma at the individual and collective levels goes beyond the recognition of subjective experience in a consulting room. Social members with different political convictions and identity affiliations need to transcend their own interests to confront together the consequences of the former government's illegal acts. The article concludes by suggesting potential contributions various psychological sub-disciplines can bring to TJ.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-N202301180005-00001,57,2022,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Ethicality of Face: Exploring the Caring Situatedness of Home-based Caretakers Providing Palliative Care in Rural Communities,"Yaw-Sheng Lin, Ya-Ting Wang","situatedness, family caregivers, home-based caring, community medicine, dwelling, phenomenological psychology","The goal of the home-based palliative care model is to facilitate the feeling of being at home for patients and their families. In contrast to the standard medical power domination perspective, the home-based palliative care model focuses on ethical relationships in addition to bio-psycho-social care aspects. The caregivers and the patient living at home are involved in a situated experience, which refers to the holistic situation of managing the experience, one's self, and the other person. We aimed to understand the situated caring of family members performing the role of home-based palliative caregiver, and examined the feeling of being at home through the care relationship. We used participatory observation and in-depth interviews to collect data. We recruited 5 family caregivers from a home-based palliative care service in northern Taiwan and interviewed each person twice. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using phenomenological psychology methods. The analysis revealed that caregivers were ambivalent about their living situation. They described their experiences as seeming both familiar and strange. The caregivers' pattern of being-in-the-world was constructed from the perspective of comfort in the human-environment relationship (a sense of feeling at home). However, they were also bothered by the problem of providing care as they faced new challenges and situations, which made their situation feel unlike home. Existence takes on alien and uncanny qualities in this unhomelike situation. Together, these two aspects of caring manifested the meaning of existentialism. In this context, caring is not only labor, it is also an ethical response to worry and helps to recapture and maintain relationships with others. Ethical caring is the cornerstone of relational understanding. It stems from human subjectivity rather than medical positivism. The 5 participants in this study shifted their focus from the displacement of others to themselves. According to Levinas (1969) and Foucault (1988), when the patient's face signals moral suffering and emotional distress, the ability to respond with simultaneous self-care is the responsibility of the caregiver. Showing that self-care is a personal ethical action. In other words, the patient and the caregiver are linked; the nature of the patient's situation requires self-care as a response. This perspective echoes the humanistic clinical approach to ethical relationships. One need not first deal with the cause of another person's suffering, but instead one needs to face the responsibility of suffering for others. We found that home-based caregivers perceived that face-to-face ethical actions initiated a shift in focus from the patient to the self. The feeling of being at home and the sense of being in a situation that was not like home were so contradictory that the participants felt forced to examine themselves and their relationships with family members. This examination highlighted home care as an ethical action and as the impetus for re-forging the self. Long-term home care can stimulate the transformation of relationships and the feeling of being at home. It can be an opportunity to enact cultural traditions, and at the same time lead to exploration of ethical care within the family. Our examination of the situatedness of home-based palliative care may support future planning for community-based palliative care in similar situations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-N202301180005-00009,57,2022,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Meta-Analysis of the Relationship between Chinese Traditionality and Employee Work Effectiveness,"Changya Hu, Yen-Yu Chen, Tingyu Chou, Mai Pham, Shihui Zhang","Chinese traditionality, workplace well-being, work behavior, work attitude, meta-analysis","Chinese traditionality is a central research construct in Chinese indigenous psychology. Originally developed by Kuo-Shu Yang and colleagues in the 1970s, Chinese traditionality has extended to the workplace context. Although many empirical studies have explored the relationship between Chinese traditionality and employee work effectiveness (i.e., work attitude, work behavior, workplace well-being), the results are inconsistent. These mixed findings lead to confusion in the nomological network of Chinese traditionality and obstruct the development of Chinese traditionality. Hence, a quantitative review of empirical findings of estimates of effect sizes between Chinese traditionality and its correlates is needed. To respond to this research call, we conducted a meta-analysis to summarize and clarify the relationship between Chinese traditionality and employees' work attitudes and behaviors. Starting in December 2019, we conducted literature searches on Chinese traditionality, including database search (12 databases) and forward search (18 articles on Chinese traditionality measures). Keywords used were ＂Chinese traditionality,＂ ＂individual traditionality,＂ ＂psychological traditionality,＂ and ＂traditionality.＂ In total, our meta-analysis database consisted of 4,930 articles. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final database contained 188 empirical studies (138 journal articles, 46 thesis/dissertation, and four conference papers) that examined employee Chinese traditionality and its correlates in the workplace. Considering the heterogeneity of the studies, we adopted the Schmidt-Hunter random effects. In addition, we corrected all effect sizes for sample error and measurement error. We found that Chinese traditionality is positively related to power distance orientation and the following work attitudes: organizational loyalty, supervisor loyalty, perceived social support, perceived organizational support, person-organization fit, job satisfaction, pay satisfaction, perceived organizational justice, organizational commitment, distributive justice, fit, identification, trust in supervisor, and trust. On the other hand, Chinese traditionality was negatively related to turnover intention. In terms of employee behaviors and well-being, Chinese traditionality is only positively related to organizational citizenship behavior, but it is unrelated to employee well-being. Furthermore, Chinese traditionality was positively associated with some demographic characteristics, inducing job tenure, age, tenure, and organizational tenure, but negatively with education. The moderation analyses showed that scales used to measure Chinese traditionality (i.e., one dimension or multiple dimensions) and geographical regions of the samples moderated the relationship between Chinese traditionality and its correlates. We discussed the future research direction of Chinese traditionality. About 87% of studies conducted in the work context measured only the subdimension ＂obedience-to-authority orientation.＂ Three possible reasons for this phenomenon have been proposed. First, Farh and his colleagues (Farh, Earley, & Lin, 1997; Farh, Hackett, & Jian, 2007) posited that obedience-to-authority orientation is the core concept of Chinese traditionality, particularly relevant for examining employee interpersonal relationships in the workplace. Second, results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses constantly suggest the issue of cross-loading items, challenging the construct validity in empirical studies. As a result, researchers resort to exploring only a single dimension most closely related to workplace context: obedience-to-authority orientation. Third, because the work of Farh et al. (1997) widely influenced the development of Chinese traditionality, most studies in our databases followed their approach. Obedience-to-authority orientation is prevalent in the studies of Chinese traditionality in the workplace. Although some researchers suggest that the obedience-to-authority orientation is equivalent to the concept of Chinese traditionality (see Hui et al., 2007; Zhao & Liu, 2020), this approach limits the scope and a precise understanding of Chinese traditionality. Our study suggests that future studies should consider including other dimensions and examine their influences. For example, male superiority emphasizes the belief that men are superior to women, which may affect how employees interact in the workplace or how they perceive certain organizational practices. Therefore, the ＂male superiority orientation＂ may be a better sub-dimension for exploring gender-related research topics. Finally, we discussed the theoretical and managerial implications of our results.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202112-202207060004-202207060004-3-79,56,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Second-Graders' Word Association Norms of Two-Character Chinese Words,"Shiou-Yuan Chen, Ciao-Han Wong, Min Liu, Tai-Li Chou","association norms, language development, Chinese, association","This is the first longitudinal word association norms of Chinese children from first to sixth grade to our best knowledge. The norms are constructed to explore the unique linguistic characteristics of Chinese. In this study, we demonstrated the norm of 327 second graders (170 boys and 157 girls) in Taiwan answered the Chinese word association task of 150 bi-character words. The participants were recruited from three public elementary schools in Taipei with various socio-economic background. The stimulus words were selected with four steps. First, we chose the 400 highest frequency bi-character words in the corpus built from textbooks, various books and essays of first to fourth graders (Minister of Education [教育部國語推行委員會], 2002). Second, we deleted the functional words, names of persons or places, and words usually appeared in idioms to make a 253 words list. Third, we used the method of Nation and Snowling (1999), asked 7 elementary school teachers and 16 third graders to rate the familiarity of these 253 words. Fourth, we selected the 195 highest familiarity words and randomly picked 150 of them as the stimulus words. The frequency of these 150 words ranged from 3,218 to 123 per million characters. The 150 words were arranged in four different orders, printed on sheets which participants were tested in groups in two 40-minute sessions. In this study, we analyzed the responses of 327 second graders to build the free association norms of these 150 words, along with the corresponding numbers of responses, commonality and idiosyncratic index. The average number of response (by type) is 98.04, ranging from 42 to 144. The average of commonality is 0.38, ranging from 0.10 to 0.75. The average idiosyncratic index is 0.22, ranging from 0.06 to 0.38. About the association relationship between stimulus word and response word, we defined 22 non-exclusive types, including superordinate category, same-level category, subordinate category, thematic-instrument, thematic-script, thematic association, meaning-similar, meaning-opposite, causation, sentence, orthography, phonology, feature, compound word, part of, analogy, orthographical mistake, phonological mistake, adjective, adverb, verb, and other. In order to demonstrate the distribution of different association relationship types, we calculated the percentages of all types among the highest association strength pairs, the highest five association strength pairs, and the highest ten association strength pairs of the 150 stimulus words. The results showed that when adding more stimulus-response association pairs into the pool, the percentages of each type varied in different directions. For example, the percentages of thematic-script type increased from 16% (the highest) to 21% (the highest five) and 21% (the highest ten). On the other hand, the percentages of meaning-similar type decreased from 33% (the highest) to 19% (the highest five) and 16% (the highest ten). The results showed that meaning-similar association type was quite popular among the pairs with highest consensus, but the percentages were decreased when more association pairs were adding into the pool. To investigate the developmental changes of semantic network, we further compared the differences between this second-grader norm and the sixth-grade norms of 272 participants which collected longitudinally 4 years later. In this study, we randomly selected 6 nouns, 6 verbs, and 6 adjectives, to compare the percentages of functional and categorical association types between second and sixth graders. The results showed that there was a greater increase in categorical relations than functional relations, suggesting a prominent role in taxonomic relatedness within semantic network for Taiwanese children older than 10 years. Besides investigating developmental changes, we could also compare this longitudinal association norms of Taiwanese elementary school children with norms of different languages. In this study, we compared the associations of the word ＂school＂ of different languages (English, Portuguese, and Chinese) and different ages (American adults, Portuguese third graders, Taiwanese adults, and Taiwanese second and sixth graders). The results showed clear difference cross ages and languages. In sum, the association norms enhance our understanding of children's semantic knowledge and its developmental course, provide stimuli for psycholinguistic experiments, and could be used in the educational field and build up theoretical framework cross different languages.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202112-202207060004-202207060004-83-120,56,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Bodily Experience of Qi: A Phenomenological Investigation,"Wei-Lun Lee, Mu-Fan Chen","the bodily experience of qi, spatial perception, the theory of qi, phenomenology, Zhuangzi","Qi (氣) is a term broadly used in Chinese and Eastern Asian societies to indicate a kind of experience, characteristic, and/or phenomena related to bodies, be it of Nature or human. Neither modern scientific theories from biology and physiology nor traditional Chinese discourses of qi (氣論), however, can provide much comprehensive understanding of the qi experienced in human body. Withdrawing from what has already been said in traditional discourses and returning to the process of experiential unfolding would be the primary task to understand qi. The present study was thus aimed at disclosing the bodily experience of qi. To avoid hackneyed assertions, three novices were invited to talk about their experience of practicing qi. A phenomenological method of analysis was applied to the descriptions of qi experience and a general structure was thus obtained. There are 8 essential themes: (1) qi as postulated and anticipated in relating to bodily feelings, (2) from linguistic comprehension to embodiment via visualizing and mimicking as the path to obtain the experiential state of qi, (3) spontaneous sensational upraising rendering both the sense of autonomy of the body and the experience of a hovering conscious agent attending to the body, (4) the postulated qi embodied and the emergence of intracorporeal space, (5) the surrounding sensory inputs and the qi-body process intertwined, (6) experiencing the transformation of the surrounding space as a shift of state, (7) relinking the qi-body process into volitional operation, and (8) the intercorporeal link experienced in the practice of qi as a way of taking care of others. Put the 8 themes into an integrative framework, Qi is thus presented as the experience of bodily manifestation in perceiving the changing space. That is to say, unlike ordinary perception that takes objects in space as the perceived, qi as a perceiving mode is that to which space is the perceived and in which come the experiential changes in bodily sensation. The significance of this finding was then put in dialogue with both Zhuangzi's discourse of qi and the modes of spatial perception in modern psychology in order to elaborate its significance as well as build the bridge between the traditional qi discourse and modern paradigm in study human experiences. In Zhuangzi, one can find that the experience of qi is portrayed as a mode of perceiving: ＂If you merge all your intentions into a singularity, you will come to hear with the mind rather than with the ears. Further, you will come to hear with qi rather than with the mind. For the ears are halted at what they hear. The mind is halted at whatever verifies its preconceptions. But qi is an emptiness, a waiting for the presence of beings. The Tao (道) alone is what gathers in this emptiness. And it is this emptiness that is the fasting of the mind (心齋)＂ (Zhuangzi, The human world). According to this paragraph, the perceiving mode of qi is for one to be empty for receiving. That is, ＂to hear with qi＂ indicates the practice of being empty, the practice of ＂the fasting of the mind＂. The experience of being empty thus can be described as the experience of having containing space. Furthermore, the perceived in the perceiving mode of qi is Tao (道). That is to say, when qi experience manifests itself as a mode of perceiving, Tao as the perceived shows in itself the character of containing space for all things. ＂It is the Tao that overspreads and sustains all things＂ (Zhuangzi, Heaven and Earth). Tao is, however, not a substantial thing but that which upholds things in their own manifestation. It, then, coincides with what was found in this study of the experience of qi, i.e., the experience of perceiving the changing nature of space. In addition, the phenomena of hovering conscious agent that witnesses the bodily manifestation in qi experience is in accordance with what is described as wandering (遊), an altered state of consciousness that witnesses freely, in Zhuangzi. In this view, what is installed at the experience of qi is the perceiver ＂I＂ in the state of wandering and the qi-stated body, and the existence of the perceived space. Regarding the modern psychological science, the understanding of qi as a mode of spatial perception can provide new perspective to that in cognitive and neuro psychology. In the researches on spatial perception, there are two ways for human beings to live in space. One is called egocentric frame of reference, indicating the preceptor as the center in getting the spatial relations with surrounding objects and obtaining body-centric space. The other is allocentric frame of reference, taking a detached point of view, e.g., bird's eye view, to draw the spatial position of oneself and obtaining world- or body-centric space. These understandings show that space in human experience is constructed by perception. Furthermore, these two modes of spatial perception correspond with two ways of building up the sense of one' own body, i.e., sensorimotor body schema and configurally coded body image. The body-centric space/ body schema and the world-centric space/ body image can be impaired in either one, according to the study on deafferented patients. With this understanding, the experience of qi can be viewed as a non-pathological moment of the separation of the two modes of spatial perception, and thus a moment of the separation of the cooperation of body image and body schema in sensing one's own body. The qi experience thus involves (1) the conscious agent with allocentric perspective turns toward the body and takes the latter into related spatial aspects; this is the phenomena of the hovering conscious agent. And (2) the spontaneous sensational upraising that separates the volitional consciousness and the bodily process. This study thus demonstrates that the phenomenological approach to the phenomena of qi can be a bridge that brings traditional discourse of qi and modern psychological science together into a dialogue on the ground of human experience.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202112-202207060004-202207060004-121-173,56,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Balance and Harmony: Unpacking the Features and Mechanisms of Self-Equanimity,Jen-Ho Chang,"psychological displacement writing paradigm, mindfulness, balance, harmony, self-equanimity","The current article aims to investigate the features, mechanisms, and benefits of self-equanimity. At first, it describes the wave of excessive self-centering that emerged in North America and has gradually spread across cultures and societies, resulting in not only maladaptive psychological adjustment at the individual level but also increased interpersonal tensions and conflicts. After all, the buffering and healing effect of the self-equanimity perspective based on balance and harmony are illustrated, and then incorporated with the psychological displacement writing paradigm and mindfulness. Firstly, the balance part is more about an individual's cognitive structure and can be demonstrated from both self-information and cognitive strategy presentation. In detail, the balance of self-information is different from the North American positive psychology that emphasizes positive information or even positive self. The balanced part emphasizes that the self can process stimuli in different directions, such as ＂positive＂ and ＂negative＂, instead of organizing them in a good or bad way, or pursuing them in a unidirectional way. With regard to the balance of cognitive strategies, the first step is to start with the individual's orientation towards the message of the self, that is, the individual is able to include more affluent and more diverse message contents, and even intuitively opposing contents. Under this premise, when an individual is faced with different situations, it is possible to extract corresponding strategies to respond to them effectively, but not only adopt a single strategy or have a fixed strategy pattern. Further, the two bases of balance are the (1) richness of the self-information, i.e., the ability to have multiple or even conflicting contents, and the need to control the contents after having multiple possibilities, so that the self-information can be; (2) ＂evenness＂ without bias. Under such a condition of abundance and diversity, the individual can achieve a balanced psychological state. Secondly, the harmony part is more on the emotional side of the individual, and can be demonstrated from two mechanisms: (1) short-term ＂restrain＂ and (2) long-term ＂stability＂. With regard to restrain, the emphasis is on the individual's ability to effectively and immediately return to their emotional starting point, rather than being automatically triggered by external events. This is also different from typical positive psychology in that not only a ＂resilience＂ to ＂negative＂ events, but also for positive events in which not over-exaggerating positive emotions or being absorbed in positive affect. In contrast, in the long term, an individual mood change tends to fluctuate in small increments over time, allowing the individual's emotional system to move toward ＂stability＂ rather than ups and downs. Thus, the individual can achieve a calm emotional self-equanimity through short-term restrain and long-term stability. However, how can we achieve such balance and harmony, and achieve a state of self-equanimity? This paper mainly focuses on the psychological displacement writing paradigm and mindfulness because they echo self-equanimity viewpoints and have specific and concrete interventions or manipulations. The effect of the psychological displacement writing paradigm echoes the view of self-equanimity, not only in terms of emotional arousal but also in terms of both positive and negative valances. In terms of the degree of emotional excitement, it is not aggressive or feeble, but rather a moderate restrain. On the other hand, the psychological displacement writing paradigm incorporated with the ＂decentering＂ and ＂non-attachment＂ aspects of the ego that has been emphasized in recent studies based on Buddhist psychology of mindfulness. Finally, this article will revisit the concept and measurement of psychological adjustments and well-being based on self-equanimity, and extend from the intrapersonal to the interpersonal level. Limitations, implications, and future directions are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202112-202207060004-202207060004-177-243,56,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Indigenous Compatibility Debate and the Role of Tacit Knowledge as Practical Wisdom,Wan-Lin Lee,"indigenous compatibility, inter-subjectivity, tacit knowledge, practical wisdom","According to K. S. Yang, the core concern of indigenous psychology is to examine psychological phenomenon in its native context. Only in this way can indigenous knowledge be generated. It cannot be transported or adapted from other regions, such as American psychology. According to Yang, in order to achieve indigenous compatibility (IC) the researcher's theory, concepts, methods, tools, and findings must reflect the local psychological or behavioral phenomenon in its local context. IC was introduced more than 20 years ago. It was a revolutionary idea in the 1990s that promoted the development of indigenous psychology in Taiwan. However, indigenous researchers have criticized IC as an over analyzed concept that is mired in etic-emic issues. In this article, I revisit the concept of IC by reviewing Yang’s initial 1997 article and the 7 related response papers published in an issue of Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies. The 1997 debate focused on the definition of and appropriate methodology for IC; it overlooked the theoretical nature and fundamental aim of IC. I began my analysis by re-examining the theoretical background of IC. Yang integrated cultural ecology and interactionism in his viewpoint. Cultural ecology is an anthropological approach seeking to explain the origin of particular cultural features and patterns by extracting common elements, which are called cultural cores. Interactionism is a psychological approach to explain how the interaction between personality traits and situations influences psychological reactions. Yang integrated these approaches for two reasons: to develop general psychological theories from indigenous studies, and to emphasize the psychological mechanism underlying individual-context interaction. Yang highlighted two factors that greatly support IC. One of them is parallel to Polanyi's (1958) concept of tacit knowledge, which emphasizes the native researcher's use of self-reflection to understand personal psychological and behavioral characteristics and functioning. Tacit knowledge can be manifested through a researcher's own experiences and observations over time with intensive introspection. Researchers who emphasize tacit knowledge can attain better IC because they already have their own understanding of the local context. They have psychological and behavioral characteristics similar to those whom they study. I propose that tacit knowledge is not a technical term but a practical wisdom that indigenous psychologists can enact implicitly at every stage of research. When we immerse ourselves in a research topic, collect data, and propose theoretical arguments, we can constantly reflect on our own embodiment of our culture and in so doing we can improve the IC of our studies. I conclude the article with two research examples, one quantitative and the other qualitative, to illustrate how a successful researcher uses tacit knowledge to achieve IC. In sum, my review highlighted tacit knowledge as the missing piece of the 1997 discussion. It is the core spirit of IC. Focusing on tacit knowledge resolves the methodological debate because it is compatible with both quantitative and qualitative research paradigms. I conceptualized tacit knowledge as a practical wisdom rather than as a list of standards to judge the quality of an indigenous study. That is, I took the concept of tacit knowledge from its original context and applied it to IC. This strangification allows the constant practice of IC as a movement toward others and makes it possible to achieve inter-subjectivity with research participants.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202106-202202100004-202202100004-3-33,55,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Applying Creative Inheritance and Transformation to Indigenous Psychology: Authoritarian Orientation Theory as an Example,Chin-Lung Chien,"authoritarian orientation, cultural system approach, Chinese relationalism, indigenous psychology, social orientation","Kuo-Shu Yang was the founder of and a strong advocate for the practice of indigenous psychology in Taiwan. Indigenous psychology has continued to develop even after his passing. In the post-Yang era, what are the tasks of indigenous psychologists? How should these tasks be implemented? Social orientation is Professor Yang's most critical theory. It entails two major problems that require solutions: (1) whether social orientation possesses indigenous compatibility (IC) in modern Taiwan, and (2) the mechanism and display of self-agency, which was predetermined in Yang's theory. I used the theoretical development of authoritarian orientation (a sub-dimension of social orientation) as an example to depict how creative inheritance and creative transformation can be applied to resolve the aforementioned problems. They can also serve as tools to strengthen future indigenous psychological research. Creative inheritance entails use of an emic approach and qualitative research design to collect people's experiences of interacting with authority figures in order to analyze the content and formation process of authoritarian orientation. This method has been used to refine Yang's conceptualization of authoritarian orientation and to resolve concerns about indigenous compatibility. Creative transformation entails application of the cultural system approach (Hwang, 2015a, 2015b) to interpret the connotation of authoritarian orientation in terms of universal models of relationships and of the self. By applying this approach, the possibility of resistance to authority is also incorporated into the authoritarian orientation theory. This method not only supplements the lack of self-agency in the original conceptualization of authoritarian orientation, but also expresses the possibility of disobedience (e.g., overt agreement but covert opposition) or rebellion against authority, thereby extending Yang's original framework and achieving theoretical transformation. Recently, some researchers applied authoritarian orientation to the topic of education and explored the dispute over whether Taiwanese society should respect teachers. Their qualitative analysis revealed that Respect for Teachers is composed of Reverence for teachers and Fear of teachers. The researchers speculated that Reverence has positive effects on teacher-student interaction and student learning, whereas Fear has have negative effects. In addition, the researchers expected that the degree of Reverence for or Fear of a specific teacher could change with teacher-student interaction. They also discussed the possibility of applying authoritarian orientation to other hierarchical relationship contexts, such as officers and soldiers in the military as well as supervisors and subordinates in enterprises. Thus, authoritarian orientation theory has the potential to address multiple contexts in future research. As an indigenous theory, authoritarian orientation not only has IC with the contemporary social context, but also relates to a universal concept. The relational models theory indicates that authority ranking is a universal form of social relations (Fiske, 1991). Relationship regulation theory indicates that in an authority ranking model, hierarchical motives prompt superiors and subordinates to perform differently; subordinates tend to respect and obey superiors (Rai & Fiske, 2011). Authoritarian orientation theory corresponds to both these theories, suggesting that it has some degree of universal meaning. However, in Confucian societies authority ranking receives increased emphasis and discourse to the extent that it has evolved into the psychological and behavioral patterns of Chinese authoritarian orientation. I proposed possible concrete methods for enabling creative inheritance and transformation. For creative inheritance, researchers can adopt a qualitative research method or conduct a review and conceptual analysis to gain renewed insight into existing concepts in order to attain a refined understanding. For creative transformation, researchers can use creative imagination to propose a novel theoretical framework or adopt the cultural system approach. Although I suggested feasible directions and concrete methods, these are only a few of the various possibilities. Maintaining diversity and openness may still be the optimal strategy to deepen indigenous theory and research. Theory creation is one of the most crucial objectives and tasks for developing indigenous psychology. Systematic dialog between indigenous and mainstream psychology is possible only from a theoretical perspective. Contemporary scholars can apply creative inheritance and transformation to decades of accumulated achievements in indigenous psychology to propose more comprehensive indigenous theories, or to adapt existing theories to respond to current social issues. No standard procedures are available regarding how creative inheritance and transformation are conducted. The approaches and suggestions presented in the present study may serve as a reference point.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202106-202202100004-202202100004-35-97,55,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Disenchantment with Scientism in Psychological Research in Taiwan,Kwang-Kuo Hwang,"epistemology, Chinese indigenous psychology, theoretical model, philosophy of science, mainstream psychology","Self-Colonization: Mainstream scientific research in psychology is a product of Western civilization. Most mainstream psychology theories are constructed on the presumptions of individualism; they are inadequate for understanding phenomena in most non-Western societies. However, non-Western psychologists tend to apply these mainstream paradigms when conducting empirical research in their own societies. Using previous research on Chinese moral thinking as an example, I illustrate that repetitive use of Western paradigms to conduct cross-cultural research in non-Western societies may result in the fallacy of circular argumentation. The conclusions thus obtained are biased and Western culture-centric and form a system of self-colonization. A Cultural Systems Approach: To help non-Western indigenous psychologists address this issue, Hwang (2019) developed an epistemological strategy for constructing culture-inclusive theories that consists of two steps: (1) constructing universal models of self/interpersonal relations, and (2) using such models as transcendental formal structures to analyze cultural systems. For example, Hwang constructed the mandala model of self (2011), the psychodynamic model of self-nature (2018), as well as the face and favor model for social interaction (1987, 2012). Hwang (2012, 2015a, 2020) then used these models to analyze the Confucian cultural system, which consists of four interrelated subsystems: (1) Confucian cosmology (宇宙論), (2) discourse on relationalism (關係論), (3) discourse on the human mind and nature (心性論), and (4) discourse on self-cultivation (修養論). Each subsystem can be used to derive additional culture-inclusive theories for conducting qualitative or quantitative empirical research. Autonomous Social Sciences: Non-Western scholars can apply Hwang's (2019) strategy to establish their own autonomous social sciences. They may construct culture-inclusive theories, use them as general laws (in accordance with Hempel's [1965] model of covering law), design adequate instruments and methods, and then utilize them as antecedent conditions for research to explain or to predict phenomena observed in the local society. This strategy provides a plausible method to escape the trap of self-colonization. From the perspective of sociology, a cultural systems approach may help non-Western scholars preserve their cultural standards. It may also enable researchers to perceive the internal cultural factors comprising the dynamic forces for social change. In the clash between modernity and traditionality, it may enable scholars to make rational choices instead of committing the fallacy of blind anti-traditionalism as China's intellectuals did in the May Fourth Period. A Critique of the Mentality of Scientism: Hwang's (2019) epistemological strategy was developed through a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary pedigree of the philosophy of science. Because most psychologists in Taiwan's scientific community conduct empirical research grounded in positivism (a natural sciences perspective), it is difficult for them to understand this approach, or even to follow the rationale for the arguments in which it is grounded. Many remain grounded in scientism, which emphasizes the natural sciences over other types of learning and culture. Therefore, I critique and respond to comments made by a reviewer of Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies point by point in order to demonstrate that a mentality endorsing scientism and mainstream psychological science will certainly hinder the future development of indigenous psychology in Taiwan.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202106-202202100004-202202100004-101-141,55,2021,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Favoritism Behavior with Work-Related and Affect-Related Resources: The Differential Effects of Two-Dimensional Differential Leadership,"Pei-Ju Hsieh, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Wan-Ju Chou","resource theory, differential leadership, job performance, vertical relational identity, loyalty to supervisor","Differential leadership (DL) is a unique leadership style within organizations in the Chinese Confucian culture in which leaders treat ingroup subordinates more favorably than outgroup subordinates. However, past studies have shown inconsistent results with respect to the effect of DL on subordinates' performance. To address this issue, we proposed a two-dimensional model of DL based on resource theory (Foa & Foa, 1974): favoritism with economic and work-related resources (i.e., work-based DL), and favoritism with affect-related resources (i.e., affect-based DL). The aim of this study is to explore the dual dimensions of DL and to examine their differential effects on job performance and loyalty to the supervisor. According to social exchange theory (Blau, 1964), ingroup subordinates who receive more resources from their leaders reciprocate by showing more devotion and loyalty. Outgroup subordinates display behaviors expected by the leader through vicarious learning (姜定宇、鄭伯壎，2014；鄭伯壎，2005). However, the central principle of social exchange is that individuals are most likely to exchange resources with those who possess the same type of resources (Brinberg & Castell, 1982). Accordingly, the impact of work-based DL on job performance should be greater than on loyalty to the supervisor. In contrast, affect-based DL should trigger more loyalty to the supervisor than job performance. In the view of the identity-matching principle (Ullrich, Wieseke, Christ, Schulze, & van Dick, 2007), we also examined the moderating role of the subordinate's vertical relational identity (RI). RI can be divided into instrumental RI and expressive RI. Instrumental RI refers to the subordinate's relational identity encompassing rational calculation and benefit exchange in the vertical dyad, whereas expressive RI refers to the subordinate's relational identity encompassing mutual consideration and the sharing of emotions in the vertical dyad. The former is information and cognition based, and the latter is normative and affect based. Past studies have shown that leadership effectiveness is stronger when the subordinate's self-identity matches the leader's behavior (Hogg & Martin, 2003; Lord & Brown, 2004); if the subordinate's self-identity does not match the leader's behavior, leadership effectiveness is reduced (Ullrich et al., 2007). Since the content of economic and work-related resources is consistent with the connotation of instrumental RI, the relationship between work-based DL and job performance and loyalty to the supervisor should be stronger when the subordinate's instrumental RI is high. Furthermore, as work-based DL motivates more job performance than loyalty to the supervisor, the moderating effect of instrumental RI should be stronger on the relationship between work-based DL and job performance. In the same vein, since the content of affect-related resources is consistent with the connotation of expressive RI, the relationship between affect-based DL and job performance and loyalty to the supervisor should be stronger when the subordinate's expressive RI is high. As affect-based DL inspires more loyalty to the supervisor than job performance, the moderating effect of expressive RI should be stronger on the relationship between affect-based DL and loyalty to the supervisor. We first revised the original scale items developed by Jiang and Cheng (姜定宇、鄭伯壎，2014), and also designed some new items based on resource theory. After evaluating content validity, 21 items were retained for factor analysis. Data collected from 341 employees were randomly split into two groups for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. The results supported the dual-factor model of DL and its discriminant validity. Another data set containing 251 colleague dyads was collected and tested with structural equation modeling. The results showed that work-based DL is positively related to job performance and loyalty to the supervisor. The former relationship had a stronger effect than the latter, indicating that corresponding resources will have stronger effects. Furthermore, the subordinate's expressive RI positively moderated the effect of affect-based DL on loyalty to the supervisor, which echoes the identity-matching principle. We proposed applying resource theory as the theoretical basis for differentiating the construct domain of DL, and examined its factor structure. We confirmed that the differential effects of the two-dimensional model of DL are in alignment with the identity-matching principle.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202012-202107260006-202107260006-3-62,54,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Predictive Effects of Parents' Beliefs about Effort on Their Children's Learning Engagement: Two Mediated Models,"Kuan-Hua Wang, Shun-Wen Chen","improvement-oriented belief about effort, family socialization, learning engagement, effort beliefs, learning motivation, obligation-oriented belief about effort","For decades, East Asian students in Confucian heritage cultures (such as Taiwan, China, Japan, and Korea) have outperformed their Western counterparts in international assessments of academic achievement (e.g., Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study [TIMSS] and Programme for International Student Assessment [PISA]). Studies show that teenage students in these East Asian countries have relatively low interest in what they learn, but experience high expectations from their parents. How can it be that East Asian students outshine their Western counterparts in academic achievement when these conditions should, according to Western theories of learning motivation, have a negative effect on academic learning? According to the Chinese achievement goals framework (Chen et al., 2009), the academic performance of students in Confucian societies is motivated by intrinsic motivation as well as parents' expectations. People in Confucian societies emphasize the value of studying hard, not only because they believe that exerting oneself improves one's abilities, but also because they believe that making an effort to learn is a role obligation of students. Previous studies showed that Taiwanese undergraduates' beliefs about effort predict their affective, cognitive and behavioral attitudes after academic failure (Chen et al., 2019). In addition, high-school teachers' beliefs about effort predict their attitudes towards both smart and struggling students (Chen et al., 2016). We recapitulated the Chinese achievement goals framework and argued that people in Confucian societies emphasize two kinds of beliefs about effort. The first is an obligation-oriented belief about effort (OBE), which assumes that exerting effort is a student's role-obligation. The second is an improvement-oriented belief about effort (IBE), which assumes that effort can overcome limitations in natural ability. Because Confucian teachings emphasize the virtuous and practical value of exerting effort in learning, these beliefs are part of family socialization. To date, no study has investigated children's effort beliefs and their parents' influence on those beliefs. We examined the predictive effects of parents' effort beliefs on primary school children's learning engagement with the children's own effort beliefs and their perception of their parents' effort beliefs as the mediators. We surveyed 266 parent-child pairs, consisting of 266 fifth and sixth grade children (131 females and 135 males) and their parents (200 mothers and 66 fathers). Children and their parents participated in the study separately and did not know the responses of their counterpart. Neither the child nor parent sample indicated a gender difference in effort beliefs. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated the reliability and validity of the effort belief scales. Structural equation modeling showed that (1) children's perception of their parents' OBE mediated the effect of their parents' actual OBE on their own OBE; (2) children's perception of their parents' IBE mediated the effect of their parents' actual IBE on their own IBE; (3) children's OBE was positively correlated with their learning engagement (i.e., exam preparation, turning in homework on time, actively asking questions in class, and listening attentively to the teacher in class); and (4) children's IBE was not correlated with their learning engagement. These results support the Chinese achievement goals framework and contain some theoretical implications. First, children are aware of their parents' obligation-oriented and improvement-oriented beliefs about effort. Second, children's perceptions of their parents' effort beliefs positively predict their own effort beliefs. In other words, parents' beliefs about effort are transmitted to their children via family socialization. Furthermore, children's OBE positively predicts their learning engagement. The relationships between children's effort beliefs and their engagement behavior in this study are consistent with the findings of a previous study with an undergraduate sample (Chen et al., 2019). In sum, we verified family socialization of beliefs about effort and the predictive effects of those beliefs on the learning engagement of primary school children. According to the Chinese achievement goals framework, a practical implication of this study with respect to the high achievement-low motivation paradox of learners in Confucian societies is that it may be important to find a way to maintain a positive relationship between a student's effort beliefs and engagement behaviors while enhancing intrinsic motivation for learning.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202012-202107260006-202107260006-63-111,54,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
An Indigenous Study of the Dual Relationship Ethical Issues Encountered by University Counselors in China,"Guang-Xiao Tian, Chih-Hung Wang","dual relationship, China, counseling, indigenous psychology, counseling ethics","Chinese culture is structured by relationism; thus, the importance of relationships between people in Chinese societies is relatively high. Modern counseling practices originated in Europe and the United States. As a product of Western cultures, these practices emphasize Western cultural factors such as individualism. Cultural differences must be addressed in order to apply these practices in Chinese societies. Western ethical standards for counseling may not apply because the boundaries of the counseling relationship may be ambiguous in China. In other words, situations that may be unethical in terms of Western cultural standards may be in line with human conditions in relation to Chinese cultural norms. Ethical issues are closely related to cultural factors. Thus, Chinese counselors may feel confused or at a loss when facing ethical norms based on Western cultural values. It is necessary to incorporate the local culture into the counseling profession. The indigenization of counseling ethics is a challenging practical topic that must be addressed in order to ensure effective counseling services. Indigenization entails combining the modern theories and techniques of psychology and counseling initially derived from Western cultures with the base (cultural traditions) and the earth (local life experience) of the local context. Western counseling ethics emphasize external, objective, and rational regulations, and the protection of five major types of client welfare (autonomy, beneficence, no maleficence, justice, and fidelity) as the starting point for counseling. Counselors must also fulfill three major duties (professional, ethical, and legal). Chinese counseling ethics emphasize inner subjective self-cultivation (doing oneself good) as the starting point for counseling. They require the counselor to be kind to the client (being good to others). In practice, it is not easy for Chinese counselors to grasp the boundaries of the two sets of requirements, which entail a dual relationship with the client. Counseling in the Chinese cultural context can thus result in estrangement in the relationship with the client, which affects the service strategy and professional ethical judgment. In this study, we examine the indigenization of counseling practices and ethical dilemmas related to the dual relationship encountered by Chinese college counselors in China. This study takes the qualitative research method of grounded analysis. The semi-structured questionnaire interviews were conducted with four professional scholars who had served as counselors of mainland universities, experience in dual relationship, and were ethically sensitive to these issues. The data obtained were analyzed and processed by cross-case analysis of different research participants using the method of close to editorial qualitative analysis. Our analysis indicated three main findings. First, the development of the dual counseling relationship in China is deeply influenced by Chinese culture, and ethical judgments regarding the dual relationship should be considered in the context of Chinese culture. Second, when counselors face ethical conflict in the relationship with a client, they go through different stages, such as the black-and-white period, the hesitation period, and the mature consideration period. With professional growth, experience, and an understanding of the Chinese cultural context, counselors can become more flexible in responding to conflict. Third, ethical dilemmas entail a process including: (1) a conflict stage in which the counselor experiences conflict when either the pressure of external evaluation or role conflict does not meet ethical standards; (2) a judgment stage, in which whether or not the counselor is able to enact a dual relationship is determined by factors such as culture, ethical values, counseling theory orientation, professional growth, and personal characteristics. Enacting the dual relationship occurs through clear role expectations with a flexible boundary; and (3) an influencing stage, in which the counselor goes through the pros and cons of the dual relationship that affect the personal experience of self-efficacy, and improves self-cultivation. In the course of professional growth and ethical learning, counselors learn to integrate external objective ethical norms with internal subjective ethical self-cultivation in order to provide flexible and mature ethical response strategies. Based on this analysis, we make suggestions emphasizing that the professional education of counselors should include ethics as well as a consideration of the Chinese cultural context.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202012-202107260006-202107260006-113-176,54,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Dual Tao-Searching Theory: The Unification and Opposition of ＂Unity of Humans and the Universe＂ and ＂Separation of Subject and Object＂,Jen-Hao Li,"metaphysics, Mandala Model of Self, neuroscience, Chinese indigenous psychology, Chinese philosophy","The meaning of human life is about the pursuit of ultimate value and attainment of the highest state of being. Eastern and Western philosophies each provide a method of reaching these goals based on their particular metaphysics. Western cultures utilize the way to what-Tao to achieve objective truth and self-realization. Eastern cultures utilize the way to how-Tao to achieve unity between humans and the universe (天人合一) and anatman (無我; selflessness or nonself). Tao means the way, the road, the truth or ultimate value. I propose the dual Tao-searching theory to depict this phenomenon and elucidate the nature and neural basis of these two approaches. Buddhism and ying-yang ontology provide the ontological basis for my arguments. I apply K. K. Hwang's Mandala Model of Self as described in the transcendental formal structure as a general research framework. To construct the dual Tao-searching theory, I used Goodale and Milner's two-streams hypothesis, which attempts to explain how an individual with one mind can have two mentalities that become the actual self, and then this actual self can be sublimated into the ideal self. I also analyze the metaphysical presuppositions of Eastern and Western cultural views and how they shape the relationship of human beings with the divine, Nature, and the secular world. In addition to constructing a theory, I also propose several feasible investigative research programs. The core concept of the dual Tao-searching theory is that the ultimate values implied by Eastern and Western metaphysical presuppositions correspond to the neural basis of the how pathway and the what pathway, respectively, as described by Goodale and Milner's two-streams hypothesis. Eastern cultures emphasize the way to how-Tao, the neural basis of which is the how pathway involved in the dorsal stream. Western culture emphasizes the way to what-Tao, the neural basis of which is the what pathway involved in the ventral stream. The Eastern way to how-Tao metaphysically focuses on unity between humans and the universe, the interdependence of all things, holism, a dynamic viewpoint, naturalism, and internal control or self-modification. Of these, the most important is unity between humans and objects, which is the essence of the dorsal stream how pathway. The Western way to what-Tao metaphysically focuses on separation between subject and object (主客對立), the self as an independent being, objects as independent entities, atomism, reductionism, a static viewpoint, anthropocentrism, and external control or dominance. Of these, the most important is separation between subject and object, which is the essence of the ventral stream what pathway. As such, I suggest that Goodale and Milner's two streams hypothesis can provide the research foundation in terms of research methods and procedures for the dual Tao-searching theory. Whereas Goodale and Milner's two-streams hypothesis portrays neuroanatomy and physiology, the dual Tao-searching theory emphasizes psychological and cultural aspects of being. Neuroscience is the current trend. Researchers in almost every discipline relate their work to neuroscience, sometimes even creating a new field (e.g., neuroesthetics, neuroeconomics, social neuroscience, or cultural neuroscience). However, indigenous psychologies seldom address the field of neuroscience. If psychologists are to follow the research principle of ＂one mind, many mentalities; universalism without uniformity＂ proposed by Richard Shweder, they need to consider biological aspects when discussing the one mind. This concept is the same as that described by Hwang's Mandala Model of Self in relation to the concept of individual. I connect indigenous psychologies with the study of neuroscience with the hope of creating a new frontier in Chinese indigenous psychology, and to provide a tentative resolution to K. K. Hwang's grand question of how to integrate the seemingly conflicting metaphysical perspectives of unity between humans and the universe (Eastern cultures) and separation between subject and object (Western cultures).",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202012-202107260006-202107260006-177-237,54,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Multiple Philosophical Paradigms: The Basis of Realism for Answering the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem,Fu Chen,"constructive realism, nousism, critical realism, realism, the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem, multiple philosophical paradigms","This article provides a detailed review of the perspective presented in the books Indigenous Social Science and The Subjective Argument of the Confucian Cultural System by Hwang Kwang-Kuo in order to clarify the philosophy of science Hwang used to support his arguments. In fact, we discovered that the hollow structure of Hwang's ＂Multiple philosophical paradigms＂ have nothing to do with any fictionality the original purpose of Hwang's books was to address the philosophical paradigms relevant to realism in order to explore the research method of relationalism. The Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem is the question of how to complete a paradigm shift in social science research methodology. I point out that Hwang's argument reflects the fundamental nature and methodology of philosophy and may not be related to realism at all. Hwang's argument cannot facilitate the bidirectional circulation of the life world and the micro world as Hwang claimed. Hwang aimed to explore the structure of the human mind, but structural thought is not equivalent to structuralism. I oppose Hwang's idea that structuralism is at the center of multiple philosophic paradigms. I believe that the problem with constructive realism is that it discusses realism without discussing realism, and that the problem of critical realism is that it is a discussion of realism that differs from realism. Both forms of realism avoid discussing realism itself. Neither responds to Chinese culture, which has an intellectual tradition that supports the idea that humans are an integral part of nature. Neither can support construction of indigenous social sciences in Chinese societies. If the basis for applying realism as an answer to the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem is validated by the argument that no previous ideologies are appropriate, I would rather return to nousism. Chinese thought develop a realism that is completely different from idealism and materialism. For Chinese thought, the controversy between idealism and materialism is meaningless, because the origin of the universe is not in ideal and material, but in the nous. It is a long research tradition and thinking style, so that I use ＂nousism＂ to call the study of the inner world of human mind. Starting there, constructive realism and critical realism can be re-evaluated with linguistic strangification so that both ideologies are understood to pertain not only to the soul, but also to the body. The micro worlds of the body and soul can be constructed, and various types of micro worlds can be integrated to develop a more sophisticated ＂constructed realism＂. Only then can the ontological strangification be consolidated. I apply the logical structure of transcendental arguments and beliefs to argue that the objective of studying Heaven and humans is neither the phenomenology of empiricism nor a construction that humans place on phenomena. An independently operating and continuously existing structure of realism lies just beyond human knowledge. The nature of the ego is to connect with Heaven. Where social habits can be ignored, the ego can return to its nature. When humans connect with Heaven it creates a phenomenon beyond the physical. People may possess not only six senses, but also ālayavijñāna (alaya consciousness) with the self. Truth comes from truth, which ultimately comes from the unity of Heaven and humans. This argument answers the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem, and also Needham's Problem. I propose that Hwang Kwang-Kuo's perspective on spiritual realism and historical realism inclines towards subjectivism as both realisms are geared towards nous. Since nous has the characteristic of Heaven and humans united as one, then humans and Heaven would originally have been conceptualized spiritually with natural flow and communication, and corporally as the self-transformation of the ego. This nature is more precisely labeled ＂intersubjectivity＂. If life is faced through self-nous and people can have their own insight into Heaven, relations, objects, and the self as they co-exist in their lives, then they develop a variety of I-thou relations. In response to the assertion that it is dangerous to value nous in an empirical life, I note that the nousism of Chinese thought is not the idealism and materialism of Western philosophy. If the nous is neither too familiar nor too distant from experience, then it should be able to go beyond experience to yield a corresponding experience. If people respect and accept the existence of deities (arising from traditional customs), but feel that it is a problem to admit the existence of nous (arising from traditional academics), it is a double standard. Hwang Kwang-Kuo provided an argument for how to complete a paradigm shift in social science research methodology. When scholars directly rethink the definition of science and accept the idea that systematic is scientific, and provide rigorous arguments for the presuppositions of indigenous social science, they create a scientific micro world. Confucianism has long been making spiritual issues into academic ones by converting faith for God into a study of the self. Confucianism is not the mere task of understanding culture in the process of human growth, but of seeking the common source idea behind different religious teachings. This cross-religious discussion places rationality in conscience. Only because the original reconciliation and symbiosis of human civilization was beneficial did Chinese thought become the thought of East Asia. If scholars continue to explore its modern significance, there is an opportunity to develop Chinese thought into a more mature Chinese indigenous social science. If scholars can then accurately relate different cultures by understanding them correctly, academic contents can become universal knowledge.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202006-202102170002-202102170002-3-53,53,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Only Fulfilling Obligation Matters? The Influence of Chinese Parents-Children Role Obligation on Right,"Shih-Chi Hsu, Chin-Lung Chien, Yi-Chao Chen","roles obligation, obligation, rights, need rule, parent-child, family ethics","This study identifies the operational rules of rights and obligations in the Chinese parent-child relationship. Chinese societies are obligation oriented. In interpersonal interactions, Chinese people emphasize the fulfillment of obligations. That is, if obligations are not fulfilled, interpersonal rules are violated. Interaction is ＂obligation first＂. Nowadays, culturally Chinese people are also aware of their rights. To investigate the relationship of obligations and rights, we consider the two most important cultural contexts in Chinese societies. In Study 1, we focused on the primacy of obligation. Chinese societies treat obligation as the priority. Thus, the operational rules are: rights vary with obligation or obligation first, rights second, or having rights depends on whether the obligations have been fulfilled or not. In other words, the legitimacy of rights varies with the fulfillment of obligations; the fulfillment of obligations significantly influence rights. In Study 1, we examined H1: In the parent-child relationship, the level of the legitimacy of rights differs significantly depending on whether obligations are fulfilled or violated. The legitimacy of rights of those who fulfill their obligations is significantly greater than those who violate their obligations. In Study 2, we focused on relationalism. Different interactive rules apply in different relationships. Parent-child interaction emphasizes the need rule, which only considers obligations, and neglects rights. As it is essential to fulfill obligations, we inferred that in Chinese parent-child interaction, the effect of the fulfillment of obligations is insignificant, meaning that obligation fulfillment by either party does not enhance the legitimacy of rights. However, once parents or children violate their obligations, it leads to negative results, which considerably lower the legitimacy of rights. Hence, H2: In the parent-child relationship, after fulfiling obligations the legitimacy of rights does not increase, but after violating obligations, the legitimacy of rights is reduced. We explored what influences the legitimacy of rights in the Chinese parent-child relationship by focusing on obligation and relationalism, as well as how fulfillment of obligation affects the variation of the legitimacy of rights. A total of 489 university students (valid sample size = 438) completed online surveys for 2 studies to test the hypotheses: Study 1A examined whether children's rights are influenced by their fulfillment of obligations. Study 1B examined whether parents' rights are influenced by the fulfillment of obligations. Study 2A explored whether children's daily fulfillment of obligations influenced the legitimacy of their rights. Study 2B probed the effect of the daily fulfillment of obligations on the legitimacy of parents'rights. Studies 1A and 1B investigated the impact of the fulfillment of obligations on rights and used the same scenarios and a between-subject design. The analysis indicated that children/parents who fulfill their obligations have greater legitimacy of rights in comparison to those who violate their obligations. H1 is accepted. Obligations have primacy over rights. Study 1 identified a difference in the legitimacy of rights, but it cannot support the conclusion that the cause of the difference is derived from the effect of obligation fulfilment. In addition, Study 1 only indicated that rights vary with obligations, and does not address the degree of variation. Study 2A and 2B explored the various levels of the legitimacy of autonomy/discipline rights before and after children's and parents' fulfillment or violation of obligations. In Study 2, we used scenarions with a 2 (fulfillment of obligation vs. violation of obligation) × 2 (pretest and posttest: pretest vs. posttest) mixed design. The analysis revealed that parents and children do not have more rights when they fulfill obligations. However, if they do not fulfill their obligations, the legitimacy of their rights decreases. This finding corresponds to the need rule under relationalism. Obligations are important, but the effect is limited. Parents and children must fulfill their obligations in order to maintain their rights. Fulfilling obligations does not increase rights, but failing to fulfill obligations decreases rights. In summary, we raised two important points. The first is the asymmetric relationship between obligations and rights in Chinese culture. Second, we identified two perspectives for examining the relation between rights and obligations: the primacy of obligation and relationalism. These findings can inspire research into Chinese ethics and interpersonal morality, and can serve as reference for investigation of the rules of interpersonal relationships. This study also raises questions for future research, such as: In western societies, are rights and obligations equal? Does obligation fulfillment enhance rights? Which cultural mechanism dominates the relationship between rights and obligation? In the future, cultural comparison research can further explore these points.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202006-202102170002-202102170002-55-101,53,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Chinese Vanity: Theoretical Analysis and Construct Validation,"Shao-Chun Chuang, Kung-Yu Hsu","validation tests, construct analysis, Chinese culture, vanity scale, vanity trait","People want to present themselves as different from others by mimicking a high-class lifestyle. This behavior may be driven by vanity. Western scholars have defined vanity as having a concern for and a positive even inflated view of one's personal achievements and physical appearance and developed a measure. Researchers have tested whether this measure can be applied across different cultures, especially eastern cultures. The results indicated that the vanity scale could be applied to different countries under some particular constraints. However, the vanity scale may be not applicable to eastern cultures. Using a western scale to probe Chinese phenomenon easily results in the imposed-etic problem. Hence, we adopted an indigenous approach to conceptualize vanity in Chinese culture and developed a measurement tool for Chinese people. Based on the fundamental lexical hypothesis, we started by analyzing Chinese adjectives and proverbs in order to conceptualize vanity. We found that Chinese vanity is conceived of as someone who attempts to pursue the praise or enviableness from others through material products, celebrity friends, or an admirable reputation and achievement in order to satisfy their own need to make a positive impression. It includes three theoretical dimensions, namely physical vanity, achievement vanity, and interpersonal vanity. Next, we generated 98 items based on the theoretical dimensions. 18 items were removed from the item pool as they were only indirectly related to vanity. An expert group inspected and evaluated each remaining item. They removed 20 items due to vague connotations. The initial version of the Chinese Vanity Inventory (CVI) consisted of 60 items with three dimensions: appearance vanity (22 items), achievement vanity (22 items), and interpersonal vanity (16 items). Items were measured with a Likert-type scale ranging from 1(very untrue of me) to 7 (very true of me). Study 1 developed the new CVI measure. A total of 605 Taiwanese participants (371 college students, 234 adults; 179 males, 426 females) were recruited online. They filled out the CVI and demographic information. We used hierarchical factor analysis and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the number of factors and delete inappropriate items. The results identified 40 items with four dimensions, namely socialite vanity, appearance vanity, achievement vanity, and popularity vanity. Socialite vanity (13 items) emphasized showing status by being the friends with a celebrity to gain praise and envy and satisfy one's need to make a positive impression. A sample item is: ＂I believe that associating with a celebrity will help my life.＂ Appearance vanity (13 items) is use of fashionable or enviable products to present themselves to gain praise and envy to satisfy one's need to make a positive impression. A sample item is: ＂If a new or limited product makes a debut, I will try to get it.＂ Third, achievement vanity (8 items) emphasizes presentation or boasting about one's abilities in order to gain an enviable reputation and satisfy one's need to make a positive impression in work performance. A sample item is: ＂I want to be better than others, no matter what kind of competition.＂ Lastly, popularity vanity (6 items) is when someone seeks to be Mr./Ms. Popularity in order to satisfy one's need to make a positive impression as being popular and beloved. A sample item is: ＂I would like others to consider me a people person.＂ The Cronbach'sα coefficient for socialite, appearance, achievement, and popularity vanity were .86, .91, .80, and .77 respectively. Study 2 tested the validity of the CVI. For the construct validity, we used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm that the inventory had four factors (socialite vanity, appearance vanity, achievement vanity, and popularity vanity). We re-tested measurement invariance in two random samples with multi-group CFAs to re-examine construct validity. For criterion-related validity, following the past research, we regarded materialism, money attitude, narcissism and conspicuous consumption as criterion-related indicators. Consumption choice for gifts and personal use was also regarded as an indicator of validity to reinforce convergent validity and discriminant validity. A total of 1,070 Taiwanese participants (male = 467, female = 589, unknown = 14; M_(age) = 22.32, SD_(age) = 3.58) were recruited online and asked to fill out the CVI, the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (40 items), the Taiwanese Materialism Scale (TMS), Conspicuous Consumption Orientation (CCO), the Consumption Scale for Gift and Personal Use, and the Multidimensional Chinese Personality Inventory (MCPI). In order to decrease fatigue from watching the screen too long, the full questionnaire was divided in two: questionnaire A (N = 586) and questionnaire B (N = 484). In addition, to test construct validity of the vanity scale, we randomly divided participants into two groups: the calibration sample (N = 535) and the validation sample (N = 535). To examine construct validity of the CVI, we first used the calibration sample for confirmatory factory analysis (CFA) to test whether the inventory had a 4-factor structure. The results showed that 4-factor model did indeed fit most of the criteria (χ^2/df =3.31, RMSEA = .066, SRMR = .067, NNFI = .806, CFI =.817) and had the lowest AIC value. Moreover, we tested the chi-square difference testing across models and found that the 4-factor model was significantly different from the 3-factor model (Δχ^2 = 390.53, Δdf = 3, p ＜ .001). Next, the multiple-group CFA was used to test the equivalence of the 4-factor model across the calibration sample and the validation sample. The results showed that the factor structure, loading, and intercepts and error variance of items were invariant across the two random samples. For criterion-related validity, the simple correlation and partial correlation analyses were used to test the relationship between criterion-related indicators and Chinese vanity. The results showed that appearance vanity was positively correlated with Narcissism's exhibitionism, Materialism's conformity and possession pleasure, as well as conspicuous consumption. Socialite vanity was positively correlated with Narcissism's entitlement, Materialism's money first, and conspicuous consumption. Achievement vanity was positively correlated with Narcissism's authority. Finally, popularity vanity was positively correlated with Materialism's possession pleasure and conformity. In sum, the subscales of the CVI had clear convergent validity and discriminant validity. To reinforce convergent and discriminant validity, regression analysis was used to test the relationship between consumption behavior and vanity. The results showed that appearance vanity positively predicted gift-giving behavior (β= .12, p ＜ .01) and appearance vanity (β= .19, p ＜ .01) and achievement vanity (β= .09, p ＜ .05) positively predicted consumption behavior for personal use. That is, whether consumption was for a gift or personal use, people high in appearance vanity had a tendency to buy higher-class products; people high in superiority vanity had a tendency to purchase higher-class products for personal use. The main propose of this paper was to conceptualize the constructs associated with vanity in Chinese culture and to develop an instrument. Based on a theoretical analysis, we developed the Chinese vanity inventory and found four dimensions: appearance vanity, socialite vanity, achievement vanity and popularity vanity. Compared with the concept of vanity in Western culture, vanity in the Chinese culture presents not only through people's appearance and achievements, but also through interpersonal interaction with celebrities (socialite vanity) or with general others (popularity vanity). In addition to these dimensions, the connotations of vanity in the two cultures were different. In Western culture, vanity was identified by an inflated opinion of the self and an excessive concern for oneself. However, in a Chinese society, vanity included an inflated view of oneself, and also the pursuit of praise from others. Overall, the findings of the current research make an important theoretical contribution to the concept of vanity in the context of Chinese culture. The Chinese vanity inventory has good reliability and validity. The limitations of this paper are discussed and possible direction for future study are indicated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202006-202102170002-202102170002-103-180,53,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Misunderstanding the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem: An Introspection on Confucian Ethical Therapy Based on a Case Studies,Fu Chen,"Confucian ethical therapy theory, Confucianism, nous, philosophy of science, Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem","The Needham Problem (why did modern science develop only in Europe and not China) was raised in the context of the early increasing socioeconomic development of China. A similar observation, ＂China has technology but not science＂, has become a common saying. Recently the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem, it means how to make Chinese ideas about the unity of heaven and human not disappear, and to dialogue with Western ideas about the opposition between subject and object, and develop a modern Chinese indigenous social science, which poses the question of how to complete a paradigm shift in social science research methodology, emerged as an alternative to the Needham Problem rather than a solution to it. China has rid itself of political and economic colonization. The next issue is how to be rid of academic colonization. This is particularly important when discussing the topic of psychotherapy. We cannot ignore the psychological impact of culture on people. Chinese thinking encompasses the unity between Heaven and humanity. It emphasizes the experiences of life. Modern science entails speculation about subject-object relationships. How to use the language of subject-object separation to accurately discuss subject-object integration is a major challenge in developing autonomous Chinese scholarship. The complexity lies in integrating the essence of Chinese culture, which has the ideological tradition of unity between Heaven and humanity, in order to reach the Western process of opposition between Heaven and humanity. In other words, the question is how to integrate the micro world of the philosophy of science that developed from the life world by understanding and clarifying the philosophy of science and accomplishing creative interpretation of the Chinese indigenous social sciences. I explore this process in this article by clarifying a misunderstanding of the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem, and reflecting on Confucian ethical healing through case studies. I also address responses by Hwang Kwang-Kuo himself. There are wrong views in Hwang Kwang-Kuo's propositions. They are not necessarily caused by blind spots of personal thinking. Even if there is such a dilemma, it is mainly the unity between Heaven and humanity in Chinese thought, and the opposition between Heaven and humanity in Western philosophy that leads to a dilemma of conflicting ideas in thought and philosophy. I discuss Hwang's research blind spots and the misunderstanding of his work. I provide a way to eliminate the loopholes in Hwang Kwang-Kuo's textual thinking in order to approach the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem and look for breakthrough points to open up a new opportunity for Chinese indigenous social science. Hwang Kwang-Kuo's claim that Chinese learning is for fundamentals and Western learning is for application is reasonable, but Chinese learning for fundamentals can't be the inherent ethics of China. If we regard Chinese learning for fundamentals as prior architecture, the architecture can only be nous with its own nature and significance so as to avoid misunderstanding the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem and harming people due to ethical departure from the corresponding space-time background. I argue that Hwang Kwang-Kuo's claim of Confucian ethical therapy theory is not mature enough and full of various qualitative leaps. Its original intention is to reconstruct Confucian ethics based on life introspection, public policy, school education, and social work to heal people. However, the problem is not only the confusion of the three kinds of reflection in Kwang-Kuo Hwang's claim, but also his attaching great importance to the absolute ethics of traditional Confucianism, which allows the oppression of humanity to be rationalized. Relative ethics are only applied in the personal relationship domain. Public ethics are fully transformed into personal relationships, but people pay little attention to public ethics (group-self relationship), which is not beneficial to the development of Confucian ethical therapy. I cite a variety of cases discussed by Hwang Kwang-Kuo in which an ethical dilemma is caused by the lack of a clear conceptualization through reflection. I propose specific measures in this paper: eliminate the collective unconsciousness influence of absolute ethics during the Western and Eastern Han period to avoid any ethical bullying; declare that relative ethics can only be confined to the private domain as a collocation of the public field, and carefully clarify the relevant responsibilities and obligations so as to meet the mutual benefits of the social reality; emphasize that Chinese society should set up a new ＂5 public ethical principles＂ (worthiness, ability, law, wisdom, interest) and develop a two-wheeled Confucian ethics to achieve balanced development in the public and private fields. Chinese society is deeply influenced by Confucianism and has its own ethical standards. Everyone has a variety of ethical relationships, so ethical therapy can have great significance for setting the coordinates for people throughout society. On the basis of completing this ethical therapy with a broad scope, I offer a 3-point revision of Confucian ethics, and hope to develop an ethical therapy of true meaning.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-202006-202102170002-202102170002-181-224,53,2020,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Necessity and Possibility of Constructing Indigenous Counseling Models,Shu-Lan Yang,"methodology, indigenous psychology, counseling","In this article, I organize the facts regarding the development of indigenous counseling methods, ideas, and studies; explain the influence of culture on counseling and psychotherapy; analyze the advantages and drawbacks of proposed indigenous counseling concepts; and discuss the reasons why an exhaustive indigenous counseling model has not yet been proposed. Buddhist mindfulness theory is the only relatively well-developed counseling theory in Taiwan that has indigenous elements. A national training center and therapist certification system have been established. Although Buddhist mindfulness theory originated from Zen philosophy in China, it was adopted as the basis for psychological therapy in the West, particularly the U.S. and the U.K, where it was mixed with western counseling theories, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. Strictly speaking, it is not a counseling model based solely on Chinese culture. In the 1990s, pioneers of indigenous psychology in Taiwan inspired counselors to generate culture-based ideas and build fully indigenous models of counseling. For example, S. L. Yang constructed the I-Ching counseling model based on I-Ching philosophy, and M. W. Wang proposed Zen philosophy for counseling. Liu's team applied the I-Ching model to career counseling. Hwang published his thoughts on the influence of Confucianism on Chinese personality. His team subsequently integrated Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism to propose psychological-healing in the form of self-cultivation. However, few empirical studies have been conducted to examine the validity of these Taiwanese indigenous counseling concepts. Most of the existing empirical studies were conducted by P. H. Chen and her colleagues. Their investigations focused on the interpersonal-conflict domain, which is too narrow. There is no empirical evidence supporting Liu's or Hwang's theories. Research on counseling theory, counseling processes, and counseling-related factors based on Chinese culture is needed. The crucial information necessary to construct a thorough indigenous counseling model is lacking. A complete and well-documented indigenous counseling model based on Chinese culture and philosophy has yet to be presented or officially published. I conclude the article by proposing a counseling interaction model that describes the process of counseling and the related factors that influence the results obtained by employing a given counseling theory. The possibility of constructing an indigenous counseling model exists, but accumulation of long-term culture-based experience with counseling and a counseling philosophy are preconditions. All indigenous counseling theories proposed must be able to stand up to empirical examination. Medical-oriented empirical research methodology may not be suitable for verifying indigenous counseling theories because of the subtle, changeable, and interactive nature of counseling. I recommend a qualitative approach to examine indigenous counseling models in order to identify the specific practices appropriate for local people.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201912-202007070003-202007070003-3-68,52,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Tranquility-Enlightenment Self-Cultivation Model: Rethinking Mindfulness from the Perspective of Chinese Three Philosophies,"Chih-Cheng Lin, Yung-Jong Shiah","self-cultivation, tranquility-enlightenment self-cultivation model, meditation, Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism, mindfulness, mental health","The concept of mindfulness has spread widely in the West. It draws on Buddhist meditation techniques, but does not present the full nature of Buddhism. Western mindfulness ignores Buddhist ideas about how self-cultivation can be used to attain the ultimate state of nonself-plus-compassion and to reach enlightenment. To fill this gap, we proposed the tranquility-enlightenment self-cultivation model (TESCM) based on three Chinese philosophies (Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism) in order to fully represent the Chinese doctrines of meditation and jing (靜, tranquility and inner peace). We first elucidated how meditation facilitates self-cultivation. The purpose of meditation in all three Chinese philosophies is to cultivate a tranquil state of mind, which allows individuals to focus on monitoring the mind, controlling desire, diminishing the ego, and increasing compassion. We refined the concepts of meditation and jing by drawing on scriptures from the three Chinese philosophies, which we used to develop the wisdom, mentality, and actions comprising the TESCM. According to the theory of strangification in constructive realism, which can be used to generalize a specific theory rooted in one culture to another; we then interpreted the Chinese doctrines of meditation and jing using Western psychological language to demonstrate the psychological functioning of the TESCM based on the cultural heritage of Chinese Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The TESCM includes giving up desire, practicing mindful stillness, selfless altruism, and reflective wisdom. Application of the TESCM entails conducting self-reflection with the wisdom to drift away from desire and toward enlightenment. The fundamental concept of the TESCM is giving up desire. Because it may cause suffering, giving up desire can lead to authentic and durable happiness. When one regulates desire intentionally, one may remain unperturbed by external influences and maintain emotional stability, thereby attaining inner peace through the practice of mindful stillness. Furthermore, giving up desire allows one to reduce engagement with self-centered and selfish behaviors, which may lead to more altruistic behavior and improved social- and self-identity. Reflective wisdom, which refers to conducting self-reflection through the principle of giving up desire, practicing mindful stillness, and selfless altruism, is a tool of the TESCM. Reflective wisdom allows one to monitor the mind. When self-centered or selfish thoughts or inappropriate desires appear, reflective wisdom can trigger the psychological function that will dissolve desire and ill will. The TESCM draws on contemporary neuroscience, emphasizing that because of brain neuroplasticity, an individual's habitus and behavior can be shaped by continuously giving up desire, and practicing mindful stillness, selfless altruism, and reflective wisdom. For instance, if one continuously works to regulate negative desires, one may acquire the mentality of having few desires in the long term. This effect can be attained through self-regulation and meditation. Overall, the TESCM depicts the psychological process of liberating oneself from desire, moving from self-centeredness to selflessness, fostering positive interpersonal relationships, and gaining real freedom from the suffering in daily life. This process leads to ultimate wholeness, psychological homeostasis, and authentic and durable happiness. Few studies have been devoted to conceptualizing the three Chinese philosophies. The present study is the first to develop a theoretical framework based on a full consideration of meditation in Chinese Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. We suggest that Chinese meditation provides a reliable and useful approach to improving quality of life. Compared to Western mindfulness, the TESCM focuses more on desire regulation, self-reflection, and moral cultivation than on hedonic happiness or wellbeing as the ultimate purpose of meditation. We conclude by indicating future directions for research on mindfulness, meditation, and mental health.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201912-202007070003-202007070003-69-114,52,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Toward a Buddhism-Inclusive Theory,Jen-Hao Li,"Buddhism, Chinese culture, culture-inclusive theory, self, indigenous psychology","This article presents a culture-inclusive theory of Buddhist psychology that adopts multiple philosophical paradigms and encompasses philosophical reflection, theoretical construction, and empirical research. I employ three major metaphysical presumptions. First, everything is changing and moving towards dynamic equilibrium; second, meaning emerges from interactions or relationships with other things, and depends on context; and third, existence is possible only when differences/contrasts are created or emphasized. All things are relational. A being is nothing more than a set of relationships. The present work follows the three ethical standards for scientific actions set forth by constructive realism: scientific actions ought to (1) help people excel; (2) harmonize human relationships, as well as the relationships between humans and the natural world; and (3) allow the true nature of things, including human beings, to manifest, rather than attempting to exercise control over them. This approach is in line with the basic tenets of pragmatism. I developed a culture-inclusive theory grounded in the fundamental tenets of Buddhism that applies the Buddhist theory of selflessness as the basis of research on the self. It also supports the spirit of Humanistic Buddhism and Pragmatism-that is, it does not discuss anything that is mystical, trivial, or not helpful for moving sentient beings towards awakening and liberation. The theory is comprised of three major parts. The first part focuses on the Theory of Selflessness and includes ideas such as rebirth, karma, compassion, samadhi, and liberation and nirvana, which are not unique to Buddhism but inherited from Hinduism. Dependent arising and emptiness of nature (i.e., selflessness) are the most distinctively unique ideas in Buddhism. I focus on Buddhism’s four Truths: all things are impermanent, all sentient beings experience suffering, all things lack inherent identity (self), and nirvana is perfect tranquility. I integrate and clarify them and critically evaluate the key concepts related to each. Traditionally there are two basic theories of selflessness in Buddhism. The first simply argues against seeing things as mine or belonging to me and urges practitioners to let go of these ideas. It was originally used in juxtaposition to the concept of atman in Brahmanism to argue against the existence of any entity that is constant and unchanging, that exists independently, or that can exercise dominance and control. The second theory of selflessness points out that the discourse on selflessness can be differentiated by ultimate truth and conventional truth. For example, the idea that the self is comprised of five aggregates falls under ultimate truth. Due to the limitations of language, people may be misled into thinking that a self exists beyond the five aggregates. In other words, the self is simply an expedient pseudonym. With this re-interpreted Buddhist theory of selflessness, I constructed two additional components: the selflessness model and the control-induced suffering and joy account. The central idea behind the selflessness model is dependent origination and emptiness. This model is built from previous models on the self: differential pattern (chaxu geju) by Xiaotong Fei, the psychosociogram by Francis L. K. Hsu, and the mandala model of self by K. K. Hwang. The control-induced suffering and joy account highlights the notion that suffering and joy have a direct and close association with the desire to exert control. I offer clarification and critical analysis of different conceptualizations of control in psychology (internal vs. external, primary vs. secondary) and argue that the way control is conceptualized differs between Buddhism and western cultures. The Buddhist notion of control is closer to the idea of self-modification. Compared to Western theories of control, the control-induced suffering and joy account has three major characteristics: (1) it is morally-implicated, (2) it considers the experiences of suffering and joy, and (3) it presupposes the oneness of subject and object. The theory of selflessness, the selfless model, and the control-induced suffering and joy account comprise the three major pillars in the culture-inclusive theory of Buddhist psychology. I propose several empirical research projects based on these pillars for implementation in the future.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201912-202007070003-202007070003-115-172,52,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Relationship between Chinese Openness and Painting Preference: Need for Cognitive Closure as a Mediator,"Li-Chi Yeh, Kung-Yu Hsu","openness, need for cognitive closure, abstract painting, art preference, representative painting","Past studies have shown a clear relationship between personality traits and art preference. Openness to Experience is an especially significant predictor for different kinds of art preference. This relationship has rarely been examined in a Chinese context, and no study has examined Chinese Openness in relation to painting preference. We examined the relationship between Chinese Openness, Western Openness, and painting preference. Chinese Openness consists of personal and interpersonal aspects. The personal aspects of Chinese Openness are similar to those of Western Openness, which reflects openness and imagination in personal intellectual and value domains. However, interpersonal aspects of Chinese Openness reflect social and interpersonal sensitivity and tolerance, which seldom appear in Western Openness. Thus, we investigated the relationship between Chinese and Western Openness and the preference for representative and abstract paintings. We expected that both Chinese and Western Openness would be significantly related to painting preference, especially to abstract paintings. We also investigated the mediating effect of Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC) on the relationship between Openness and painting preference. NCC reflects predictability, preference for order and structure, decisiveness, closed-mindedness, and discomfort with ambiguity. Past studies have revealed that in terms of art preference, people with high NCC like realism (e.g., mannerism) and dislike nonrealism (e.g., surrealism). NCC is a dispositional dimension that is similar to Openness in some ways, but it is more easily influenced by situational characteristics like time limits. Therefore, we expected NCC would be positively related to representative painting preference, but negatively related to abstract painting preference. Furthermore, we expected that NCC would mediate the association between Openness and type of painting preference. We recruited 254 participants (121 women, Mage= 21.6) to complete the measures for Chinese Openness (adapted from the Cross-Cultural Personality Assessment Inventory), Five International Personality Traits, and Need for Cognitive Closure. They also rated their preference for 6 representative paintings and 6 abstract paintings that included Chinese ink paintings and Western oil paintings. The results of the correlational and regression analyses indicated that both Chinese Openness and Intellect/Imagination had a significant positive relationship with a preference for abstract paintings, but NCC had significant negative relationship with this preference. However, Chinese Openness, Intellect/Imagination, and NCC did not have any significant relationship with a preference for representative paintings. Moreover, after controlling the effects of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect/Imagination, NCC still had a significant mediation effect on the relationships between Chinese Openness and preference for abstract paintings in the mediation analysis, but the same mediation effect was not found in the relationships between Intellect/Imagination and abstract painting preference. Chinese Openness had a significant positive relationship with the preference for abstract painting and this effect was mediated by NCC, but the same effect was not obtained for Western Openness (Intellect/Imagination). It is possible that Chinese Openness, especially the interpersonal aspect, relates to seeking symbolic meaning in paintings and to understanding and tolerating painters' distinctive and individualized ways of seeing the world in paintings. Abstract paintings provide these kinds of opportunities, especially Chinese landscape paintings that combine multiple perspectives to create a conflicting but harmonious aesthetic experience for viewers. People with high Chinese Openness prefer this kind of painting. Another interesting but unexpected finding was that there was no effect of NCC on the preference for representative paintings. It is possible that although NCC is a dispositional dimension, it can also be a state dimension under some conditions, such as when there is no time limit. That is, people may be low in NCC when there is no time limit on rating one's preference for the paintings, so there is no effect evident between NCC and preference for representative paintings. The cultural implications of the relation of Chinese Openness to abstract painting preference and the psychological mechanism underlying appreciation of Chinese landscape paintings are issues to be explored in future research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201912-202007070003-202007070003-173-225,52,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Review of Chinese Indigenous Research on the Self,"Jen-Ho Chang, Chien-Ru Sun, Kuang-Hui Yeh","self-process, self-structure, social-oriented self, non-self, four-part theory of the Chinese self, individual-oriented self, self, big seven factor model of Chinese personality","According to our systematic review of research on the self that has been published in Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies, the most discussed domains of research relate to self-structure (self as an object) and self-process (self as an agent). The main topics in the self-structure domain are the four-part theory of the Chinese self, and the big seven factor model of Chinese personality. The former indicates that the Chinese self contains four sub-selves: the individual-oriented self, the relationship-oriented self, the familistic (group)-oriented self, and the other-oriented self. In addition, each sub-self has two domains (public and private), and four aspects (actual, ideal, ought, and possible). The whole self-structure consists of these 4 × 2 × 4 dimensions. Most current empirical research on this domain focuses mainly on distinguishing between the individual-oriented self and the social-oriented self (including the relationship-oriented self, the familistic or group-oriented self, and the other-oriented self). In addition, a non-self perspective has been proposed in recent years. It provides a relatively unique approach to understanding the Chinese self-structure. However, the non-self model is currently solely theoretical without related measurements or experimental paradigms. Empirical investigation is needed to examine the validity of its psychological propositions, and then explores its specific psychological mechanism. The traditional big five model (openness, consciousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) has been challenged in the Chinese cultural context. Full support for this model has not been found in Chinese sample. After a series of studies that applied a more culturally appropriate perspective and research design, researchers proposed the big seven factor model of Chinese personality: competence, industriousness, other-orientedness, agreeableness, extraversion, large-mindedness, and contentedness. It showed better model fit and validity in Chinese societies. The major topics in the domain of self-process are the bicultural composite self, and person-situation interactive self-regulation. Some research has revealed that modern Chinese people develop an integrated self that includes both individual and social orientations. How these individuals behave is contingent on the context. They behave more interdependently in the social-oriented context, and more independently when they encounter an individual-oriented context. The person-situation fit indicates that in Chinese societies, the self is not a fixed or static entity. It is quite flexible and malleable to fit in the demanding of the situation. It has process-based characteristics, and it operates dynamically with agency. That is, as an agent, the goal of the self is frequently to balance the needs of both oneself and others in different contexts. The underlying mechanism of how these different selves are integrated, composited, or balanced still remains unclear. In our review of Chinese indigenous self research, we also noticed that the research methods employed by Chinese indigenous self researchers include qualitative interviews, content analyses, questionnaires, survey investigations, and experimental manipulations. How to combine these different qualitative and quantitative methods to gain an advantage in conducting studies of the Chinese indigenous self also needs to be considered. Finally, we expect the future indigenous research on the Chinese self can go beyond the dual structural perspective of individual and social orientation and explore new issues, such as providing further theoretical elucidation and empirical testing of the construct of selflessness. Moreover, we should pay more attention to the social changes and technological developments of the modern impetuousness on the Chinese self. For instance, the digital interfaces and mobile phones such as ＂i＂ generation effect (iPhone, internet, and I), and population aging in Chinese societies. These changes might have great impacts on the psychological process of the individual, and on the management of the structure and the process characteristics of the contemporary Chinese self. These important issues also need to be addressed in future research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201906-202001130004-202001130004-3-31,51,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Review of Chinese Indigenous Research on Interpersonal and Intergroup Relations,"Shih-Chi Hsu, Kuang-Hui Yeh","filial piety, types of interpersonal relationships, social identity, cultural psychological mechanism, intergroup relation, culturally significant concepts","The terms relational and collectivist are used to describe the Chinese cultural emphasis on groups and relationships, which is different from the focus on individuals in western societies. To provide an in-depth holistic understanding of the fundamental characteristics of Chinese people, we review articles on interpersonal and intergroup relations published in Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies. Since the journal was initiated, the greatest quantity and diversity of articles published have focused on the topic of interpersonal relationships. The research interest in this topic reflects the importance of interpersonal relationships as the representative cultural feature of Chinese societies. We reviewed and divided articles on interpersonal relationships into three categories. (1) Types of interpersonal relationships and their rules of interaction: The primary characteristic of Chinese social relationships is that Chinese people use different rules of interaction to interact with people in different relationships. In order to understand the mechanism underlying Chinese interpersonal relationships, it is necessary to probe how Chinese people classify social relationships and identify the rules they apply in subsequent interactions. Relationships are classified according to the principle of qin-qin (loving one's relatives according to the relationship), and the principle of zun-zun (serving the superior). (2) Culturally significant concepts and their psychological functions: Social interaction is important in daily life. When a social interaction leads to conflict or distress, Chinese people regulate this negativity according to cultural expectations. Most regulating responses and behaviors reflect a uniquely Chinese way of adapting to social change. For example, mientze (face), yuan, ren (forbearance) and zhong yong are designed to strengthen interpersonal relationships or cope with conflict and distress in social interaction. (3) Specific interpersonal relationships (especially in the case of filial piety in the parent-child relationship): The parent-child relationship is the most dominant relationship in Chinese society. It is not much affected by social change and retains many traditional features in contemporary society. As a representative cultural value, filial piety not only reflects the basic interaction principles between parents and children, but also integrates the generation-age-gender order to support the operation and continuity of family functions. The parent-child interaction principle can be generalized to other social relationships as well. We reviewed and discussed the development of indigenous filial piety theory to highlight filial piety as the most culturally representative value in Chinese society. We elucidated how to conceptualize filial piety from the perspective of psychology and how to develop a corresponding theory and apply it in the real world. Our review and discussion of articles in each category reveals how these studies evolved. We further expanded the scope of the review from the topic of interpersonal relationships to the topic of inter group relations. National identity has been an important social phenomenon and research topic in Taiwan over the past two decades. It influences the behaviors and life styles of Taiwanese people. We also detailed the process that is changing national identity in Taiwan. The study of echoes the tenet of this journal: to reflect and describe contemporary social phenomenon and the lives of local people. Finally, we adopted ＂one mind, many mentalities＂ as a methodological perspective to integrate the 25 years of research on the topic of interpersonal relationships and inter group relations, and to paint a possible future for Chinese indigenous psychology. By tackling both cultural and psychological factors, researchers are able to achieve the most fundamental purpose and common goal for Chinese indigineous psychologists: having the academic autonomy to implement local knowledge and theories.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201906-202001130004-202001130004-33-88,51,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
From Cultural Psychology to Humanistic Clinical Psychology: The Indigenization of Clinical Psychology,"Wei-Lun Lee, Yaw-Sheng Lin","psychotherapy, ethical healing, indigenous clinical psychology, humanistic clinical psychology, human suffering, phenomenological method","The existence of clinical psychology in Taiwan dates to the 1950s. Not until 2001 did clinical psychology achieved legitimacy as a profession when it was included in the licensure examinations for medical professionals. In its early stage, clinical psychologists did not care about indigenization. Even as the indigenous movement in social and personality psychology grew, clinical psychologists in Taiwan did not show much interest. Their indifference to indigenous reflection can be understood in terms of a post-colonial third-world mindset in which western scientific disciplines are viewed as representing universal knowledge. In addition, the acceptance of biomedicine as the legitimate form of health care meant that clinical psychology as a form of health care had no need to be concerned with the socio-cultural conditions of people's lives. The task of indigenizing clinical psychology was thus twofold. It was necessary to reflect upon the subtle process of knowledge colonization to build a tangible epistemological foundation for indigenization. It was also important to develop efficient interventions for professional practice. As a consequence, the East/West dichotomy employed in the indigenization of social and personality psychology cannot be a proper starting point for an indigenized clinical psychology. Mental illness requires clear medical standards for identification, and concrete and efficient treatment solutions, rather than just academic arguments. An indigenous clinical psychology should both recognize that mental suffering is always social and cultural, and also be manageable through the professional health care system. It should be not only an academic movement but also feasible for clinical practice. Throughout its 25 years, Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies has supported discussion about the path for indigenization of clinical psychology in both theoretical and practical dimensions. This path can be described as defining the meaning of being indigenous as a face-to-face encounter with the sufferer, taking the route of phenomenology for epistemological reflection, returning to the life world, and disclosing interpersonal order (i.e., ethicality) as the core of psychological distress in Chinese societies. Ethical healing is the key concept for exploring the essential structure of suffering and recovery. We reviewed the progress and the main agenda concerning both the academic and practical aspects of indigenized clinical psychology in Taiwan. In our review we: (1) provided an overview of the 25-year indigenization process, whose core feature can be described as an engineering of constructing ＂cultural buffer＂ between modern biomedical practice and local people's psychological lives; (2) thematically articulated the problems and solutions in the epistemology and methodology of the indigenization of clinical psychology in terms of the differentiation of two models of indigenization: the horizontal model of East-West dichotomy and the vertical model of returning to the life world; (3) provided evidence of the understanding obtained by returning sufferers' experiences back to their cultural and social contexts in which ＂ethical predicament＂ emerged as the hidden thread underlining Taiwanese psychological suffering; and (4) introduced the forms of psychotherapy as ethical care, focusing on the ＂self for being ethical,＂ the acting agent concerned mostly with the interpersonal ordering in its life, and therefore, finding ways to re-order the interpersonal constellations. We thus present a path of restoring the fertile ground of psychological life within the modern profession of clinical psychology. We define the clinical practice as witnessing to the suffering rather than the techne of cure. The ultimate concern, in the end, is not to define one's psychopathology, but to reveal one's ethicality towards others. We conclude that the pursuit of a proper indigenous clinical psychology will ultimately lead to the development of a humanistic clinical psychology, which focuses not just on human beings but also human becomings in clinical practice. In the future, the indigenization of clinical psychology in Taiwan will continue connecting clinical practice to culture, society, and history in order to ground us as human becomings.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201906-202001130004-202001130004-89-167,51,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Review of Emotional Display Rules: Roles in Chinese Context,"Chia-Hua Lin, Ding-Yu Jiang","vertical relationship, Chinese culture, emotional display rule, emotion expression","Emotional expression plays an important role in interpersonal interaction and communication. Emotion conveys information that helps the receiver to understand the expresser's intentions and influences the receiver's behavior. Studies have shown that emotion can be expressed nonverbally through tone of voice, physical gestures, and facial expressions. How people express their emotion is affected by culture; emotional display rules provide the norms for individuals to express emotions that meet cultural expectations. Regulating emotional behavior based on emotional display rules reduces vagueness and uncertainty in social interactions. Past studies have discussed the behavior and effects of interpersonal emotional display rules in Western culture, but the corresponding rules in Chinese culture are still poorly understood. Chinese culture has unique vertical role relationships characterized by unequal interaction norms, and there are different behavioral expectations for people of different statuses within a vertical relationship. We reviewed journal articles from Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies in order to develop a framework of the emotional display rules used in Chinese role relationships. We focused on studies of three kinds of role relationships that have a clear vertical structure in Chinese culture: the relationships between husband and wife, parents and children, and leader and subordinate. We reviewed 44 articles (12 about marriage, 13 about the family, and 18 about organizations) and conducted a content analysis. The analysis showed that the relationship between husbands and wives follows Chinese cultural traditions. There is a hierarchical difference between genders, with men having greater power than women. Wives are expected to be warm, caring, and obedient to their husbands. Expressing positive emotion and suppressing negative emotion are the wives' main display rules when interacting with their husbands. In contrast, husbands represent authority in the family, and do not need to regulate their emotions. Husbands should be willing to suppress their negative emotions to avoid conflict and maintain harmony in the family, but tend to use implicit ways to express their love and thankfulness toward their wives. In the vertical relationship between Chinese parents and children, Chinese society encourages parents to be strict with their children's education, and parents are thus expected to mask their positive emotion and express negative emotion to prevent their children from becoming rebellious, and to build their authority in the family. Children must follow the norm of filial piety by taking good care of their parents and suppressing their own needs to fulfill their parents' expectations. The corresponding emotional display rule requires children to express positive emotion and suppress negative emotion when interacting with their parents. Cultural norms may also affect interpersonal interactions in the workplace. Chinese culture emphasizes hierarchy and authority. Authoritarian leadership is a traditional Chinese value, with leaders expected to be father-like, disciplinarian, and powerful. Leaders may reprimand their subordinates and behave seriously to earn subordinates' reverence. Chinese subordinates are sensitive to authority and may actively show obedience and loyalty to their leaders. They tend to suppress their negative emotions to fulfill leaders' requests and express positive emotion to support leaders. Based on this review of Chinese vertical role relationships and emotional expression, we present six propositions. First, we propose that people with a lower status (such as children, wives, and subordinates) follow the emotional display rules of suppressing negative emotions and expressing positive emotions, whereas people with a higher status (such as parents, husbands, and leaders) follow the emotional display rules of expressing negative emotions and suppressing positive emotions (Proposition 1). We also suggest that the specific role norms of Chinese culture may enhance individuals' perception of emotional display rules in vertical role relationships (Proposition 2). In the organizational context, subordinates, who occupy a lower status role, tend to pay attention to others' emotional cues to regulate their emotions appropriately, and thus may be more conscious of emotional display rules. In contrast, supervisors may pay less attention to others' emotional cues because they are the higher status role model and do not need to be careful about following norms (Propositions 3 and 4). Furthermore, we propose that personal values may moderate the relationship between emotional display rules and individuals' emotional expressions. When people value interpersonal harmony, they may suppress negative emotion to avoid conflict, but may also be concerned that expressing positive emotions will be seen as immature behavior. Therefore, the display rule of suppressing negative emotions has a stronger positive association with suppressing behavior, whereas the display rule of expressing positive emotions may have a weaker association with expressing emotional behavior when individuals value harmony (Proposition 5). We further hypothesize that the values associated with the modernization of Chinese societies influence the effect of Chinese emotional display rules. Individuals displaying more modern characteristics may pay less attention to the cues of others and to authority. The emotional display rules of vertical role relationships may have a stronger positive effect on emotional display behavior in individuals displaying fewer modern characteristics (Proposition 6). In this article, we reviewed empirical studies of Chinese vertical role relationships in marriage, the family, and organizations, and analyzed the emotional interaction behaviors in these studies to identify the features of emotional display rules in Chinese culture. Future research could explore Chinese emotional display rules in different situations and the personal consequences of emotional interactions to gain a better understanding of emotional expression in Chinese societies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201906-202001130004-202001130004-169-228,51,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Association of Compartmentalization and Integration of Multiple Values and Psychological Adjustment,"Wei-Fang Lin, Yi-Cheng Lin, Chin-Lan Huang","psychological adjustment, multicultural values, compartmentalization, integration","From modernization to globalization, Taiwan has become a multicultural society. Individuals inevitably encounter conflicts between multicultural values. Previous research has emphasized on the coping strategy of cultural conflicts to discuss how could incompatible cultural values coexist within an individual. Yang (2004) proposed two psychological mechanisms to describe coping strategies for handling multicultural values. Compartmentalization refers to exercise multicultural values in different life domains to avoid potential conflict. Integration refers to use of a coherent system comprised of the multicultural values to deal with daily life. However, Yang did not provide empirical evidence as to whether compartmentalization and integration are distinguishable and effective for managing multicultural values. The primary aim of this study is to develop a measure paradigm of Yang's compartmentalization and integration strategies and to examine the association between the use of each coping strategy and psychological adjustment. We applied Showers' (1992) card-sorting task to measure individual differences in degree of compartmentalization and integration. Participants were provided a deck of 40 cards with each card containing an adjective representing either one of the cultural values. Participants were asked to sort the cards into different groups to describe different aspects of themselves or their life. Compartmentalization implies two different cultural value cards were separated into different groups whereas integration implies composite cultural value cards in each group. In addition, we further proposed that the effect of compartmentalization and integration on psychological adjustment would be contingent upon the individual's level of multicultural value mix. Specifically, we hypothesized that integration is a better coping strategy for those who are high in multicultural value mix. For those who identify with only a specific set of cultural values, we expected no significant difference between compartmentalization and integration in psychological adjustment. In the pilot study, 327 college students completed traditionality-modernity scale. We invited 22 participants who has relative high traditionality and high modernity and 26 participants who identified modernity more to join the formal Study 1. All participants in Study 1 completed card-sorting task and a package of questionnaire including Chinese happiness inventory and subjective well-being and life satisfaction. We used traditionality and modernity as two cultural representations in card-sorting task to examine the effects of compartmentalization and integration on psychological adjustment. Neither the main effects of the coping strategies nor the extent of multicultural values, nor the interactions of these two factors were significant. One possible explanation was that current college students tend to be more modernized than traditionalized so there was not enough variation along this dimension. In Study 2, 107 college students completed card-sorting task and questionnaires. We used progressive and humble as multicultural representations to index the extent of multicultural values mix and also serving as materials in card-sorting task. Corresponding with our hypotheses, the interaction between the degree of multicultural value mix and coping strategies was significant in predicting psychological adjustment. Specifically, for those who were more identity with one specific cultural value, there was no significant difference in psychological adjustment whether individual used compartmentalization or integration strategy. In contrast, for those who were high in both cultural values, individuals who used integration strategy reported better psychological adjustment then those who used compartmentalization strategy. Our findings highlighted that both coping strategies may have an impact on psychological adjustment, but their utility varies with the individual's degree of multicultural value mix. In addition, our findings also indicated the changing cultural values in Taiwanese college students. Comparing to thirty years ago, collage samples today identify with modern cultural values more. The concepts of traditionality and modernity may be ineffective for capturing multicultural representations. The implications for multicultural conflict resolutions were also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201906-202001130004-202001130004-231-275,51,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Construction of an Inward Multilayer-Stereo Mandala Model of Self Based on the Book of Changes: The Unity of Self and Heaven Theory,"Jin Xu, Jiun-De Lin, Ling-Cong Zhang, Yung-Jong Shiah","Book of Changes, unity of Self and Nature Theory, Mandala Model of Self, unity of Self and Nature","There are two kinds of self: one from the western psychology, and one from the philosophies of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. The maintenance and strength of the self are core concepts in western psychology and is particularly relevant to egoism, which is a process that focuses on the hedonic principle in pursuit of desires. In contrast, the philosophies of Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism all draw on the principle of self-cultivation. Confucianism emphasizes the relational self and Buddhism centers on the nonself. The Book of Changes, which provides the metaphysical basis of Confucianism and Taoism, depicts the unity of self and heaven. This unity is the original self, and it is reached through the process of self-cultivation. The purpose of this paper is to present a theory of the unity of self and heaven based on the Book of Changes. No prior researchers have proposed such a theory. We used Kwang-Kuo Hwang's Mandala Model of Self (MMS) as a framework to analyze the Book of Changes. Based on this analysis we then used the concept of tai chi in the Book of Changes to construct the Self and Heaven theory, which we named the inward multilayer-stereo mandala model. We used this model to analyze the inner self structure based on a full consideration of the Book of Changes in order to present a self theory to logically and systematically elucidate the teachings of the Book of Changes in a theoretical way. The scope of the unity of self and heaven encompasses the cultivation process from the self of Western individualistic culture to the unity of self and heaven. The unity of self and heaven is a true inner self structure. It is a whole self that is neither desire driven nor seeking a variety of identities as defined by western psychology. Our model contains 4 layers representing the process of cultivation of the self from an individualistic self to the unity of self and heaven. The first layer of the model presents the 8 types of behavioral expressions of self, echoing the bagua symbols. The second layer applies the MMS to represent the 4 image symbols of the Book of Changes. The third layer presents the united opposite selves evolving from the liang yi symbols. In this layer, a self is constricted by two kinds of confrontations derived from the MMS, leading to an opposite but united dynamic state. The last layer is the unity of self and heaven derived from the tai chi symbol. It is a contented and harmonious state with integrity. This cultivating process includes facing original desires, cultivating desire by way of obeying nature, minimizing the desire to meet and increasing the realization of altruism or compassion. . According to our model, these 4 layers comprise a progressive way to practice self-cultivation with the goal of attaining unity of self and heaven: facing desires, dealing with desires using the middle way to minimize them, accepting self-identity, and obeying nature to achieve the experience of union with the universe. The goal of these 4 steps is to face the real self, to get rid of the false feeling of egoism, and eventually to reach a unity of self and heaven that is integrally connected to the experience of eliminating the sense of self and its psychological structures. We also provide a psychological comparison between the unity of self and heaven and the western self. Specifically, we illustrate the difference in psychological processes between the self-cultivation of the Book of Changes and the individualistic self. Our model provides a psychological construct that is different from the Western perspective in terms of self-development. The ultimate goal of unifying self and heaven is to attain authentic durable happiness, harmony, wholeness, and psycho-social equilibrium. Our model provides a personality construct different from the Western personality construct. It also provides answers for a sense of unifying self and heaven may develop. It also provides a possible interpretation of the meaning of life and its ultimate goal. We are the first to postulate an academically respectable theory based on a full consideration of the Book of Changes. As a guide toward authentic, durable happiness, it may contribute to the solution of a variety of mental health problems. The intention of this article was to offer a theory to guide future and innovative research into the potential mutual enrichment of the Book of Changes, current psychological theory, research, and practice. Although more research is needed on this front, it is hoped that our model open significant new avenues for mental health research and unravel the secret of why the Book of Changes has lasted for thousands of years.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201906-202001130004-202001130004-277-318,51,2019,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Mandala Model of Confucian Self-Cultivation: A Framework for Analyzing the Mechanisms of Dual Belief in Heaven and Spirits within the Chinese Funeral Tradition,Nam-Sat Chang,"self-cultivation, Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, religion","Confucian philosophy calls for paying respect to one's deceased ancestors as an act of filial piety. The deceased are believed to enjoy an afterlife among the living. Using funeral traditions as the starting point, I explore how religious faith applied in Chinese culture. Kwang-Kuo Hwang (黃光國) pointed out that Chinese religions are constructed on a particular structure of dual belief in Heaven (Tien) and spirits (kuei-shen). Unlike the Western subject-object dichotomous worldview, which presumes that the individual is independent from the external world, traditional Chinese beliefs emphasize an analogy between Heaven, circumstance and man. Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism all support mental synchronization of humans and the universe. The functions and implications of funerals are complex and difficult to understand with Western reductionist logic, so I outline the categories of Chinese self-cultivation system as a whole from a Buddhist perspective. Based on theoretical and empirical studies of religious dimensions and Chinese personal religiosity that rely on the psychological concepts of a mortality salience effect and continuing bonds, I propose a paradigm shift for studying religious mechanisms in Chinese culture and develop the mandala model of Confucian self-cultivation. This model is intended to aid analysis of Chinese beliefs in Heaven and spirits. I provide an integrative discussion of the relationships among the living, the deceased, and Heaven in Chinese culture, and an outline for exploring the principles of self-cultivation and enlightenment.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201812-201907040002-201907040002-3-58,50,2018,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Fitful Self in Exile: The Transformation Process of Converted Taiwanese Christians,"Chia-Le Ho, Li-Li Huang","Transformation, Conversion, Christian","This study analyzes the individual transformation processes of Taiwanese Christians' conversion experiences. To explore the process of conversion, we considered both the psychological factors and social contexts. We interviewed five first-generation Christians from different denominations, using semi-structured interviews and followed the theoretical saturation principle. Based on the different conditions during the conversion process, we have identified four stages for the conversion. The first stage entails following traditional rituals without the appreciation of underlying reasons, which may lead to surface learning. At the second stage, the individual is attracted to the Christian perspective and cultural conflict becomes the main reason preventing them from changing religion immediately; how to face the difficulty of being a Christian within a Chinese family plays a crucial role in individual transformation. At the third stage, individuals start trying to find suitable ways to maintain family harmony and yet be autonomous in their adoption of religion. Finally, individuals overcome their hesitation and finish the conversion process. They shift from mainly being dominated by social network (collectivism) to autonomously choosing a particular god as the center of their (spiritual) life (individualism), and intend to influence their family.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201812-201907040002-201907040002-59-108,50,2018,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Think More If You Want to Negotiate: The Relationship between Negotiable Fate and the Amount of Information,"Hui-Tzu Lin, Chien-Ru Sun","thinking style, negotiable fate, inclusion condition, holistic thinking style, exclusion condition, fate, dialectic thinking style","Chiu et al. (2012) analyze the Chinese and English proverbs and find there are three kinds of fate beliefs: Fatalism, Negotiable fate, and Personal agency. Research also suggests that East Asians have a more holistic and complex thinking style than Americans, and take more information into account when making decisions. We propose that when Taiwan Chinese are primed with the Negotiable fate belief, more information will be included, especially in the exclusion condition. In study 1, participants were run individually and were primed with one of three fate beliefs. They were then asked to read a scenario that described an accident and told to include or exclude possible reasons for the accident. 125 participants were randomly assigned to a 3 (priming condition: fatalism vs. negotiable fate vs. personal agency) × 2 (choice set: inclusion condition vs. exclusion condition) × 3 (reason type: external-related vs. fate-related vs. personal-related) mixed design. Results showed that the size of the choice set was larger in the exclusion condition than in the inclusion condition. Also, participants who were primed with negotiable fate would take significantly more reason information into consideration in the exclusion condition than those who were primed with other two fate beliefs. In the study 2, 158 participants were asked to answer a set of scales, and found that the negotiable fate belief were positively correlated with holistic thinking and dialectic thinking styles.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201812-201907040002-201907040002-109-149,50,2018,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Through a longitudinal in-depth approach, this study examines 2 top Taiwanese male tennis players and their interactions with a total of 6 coaches in their development trajectories. Data sources included interviews, observation, and documentation. The analysis yields 3 important findings. First, paternalistic leadership does not remain stable. Rather, it evolves over time. Second, the dynamic interplay amongst its 3 elements results in different compositions, and such compositions are affected by the social context and players' accomplishments. Third, the dynamic interplay is jointly constructed by the players, their coaches, and the social contexts in which interaction unfolds.

＂Good New Men＂ and ＂Good New Women＂? Role Obligations in Contemporary Chinese Marital Relationship,"Szu-Chia Chang, Shih-Chi Hsu, Wei-Hsin Li","positive duties/negative duties, marital role obligations, gender, marital status, perfect duties/imperfect duties","Gender roles are becoming more pluralistic in modern Taiwan. The traditional notion that men are the breadwinners and women are the housekeepers is no longer the norm. The gender (marital) roles of the ＂good new men＂ and ＂good new women＂ are frequent topics of discussion. We apply the theoretical perspective of social representation to explore the content and degree of compulsiveness of husbands' and wives' roles in contemporary Taiwanese society. In the first phase of the study, we asked 47 adults to write their views of a husband's and a wife's role obligations. Items in the role obligation lists were used to construct a role obligations scale. Subsequent analyses examined whether there were differences in terms of the degree to which a given role is perceived as obligatory as a husband or a wife, and to clarify whether these differences were related to the gender or marital status of the participant. A total of 367 adults (20-50 years old) completed the scale. Results showed that: (1) marital role obligations can be classified into 5 categories: economic resources, relationship management, household work and financial management, work and family issues, and intergenerational relations. The items varied in terms of their degree of compulsiveness. (2) The participants thought that the husband's role obligations were more compulsive than the wife's role. (3) Compared to men, women had higher requirements for each role category, while married adults only differed from unmarried adults in terms of the economic resource and intergenerational relation role obligations.

Confucian Psychology: Maze and Breakthrough Confronted by Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem,Fu Chen,"nousology, nousism, Hwang Kuang-Kuo Problem, Chinese culture, spirical realism, historical realism","If the Chinese indigenous social sciences are not mature enough to get around the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem, then the content and nature of this problem should be clarified. In particular, Hwang's ＂maze＂ must be understood. Hwang has failed to answer the two contradictions in his own theory. First, he used the ＂opposition between humans and nature＂ paradigm in philosophy of science to understand Chinese thinking on ＂the unity of heaven and man＂. Can a ＂micro world＂ based on the philosophy of science confirm and explain a ＂life world＂ developed in accordance with Chinese thought? Second, Hwang interpreted his＂mandala model of self＂ and his ＂theoretical model of face and favor＂ from the perspective of individual-oriented social interests. How can he verify that his models not only explain the main principles of Confucianism, but also reveal Sunyata, the highest concept of Buddhism? Hwang has attempted to integrate various ideas, but he has not resolved the two major dilemmas of ＂The Communication of Chinese and Western thought＂ and ＂The Communication of Confucianism and Buddhism＂. Instead, we should recognize the actual existence of nous from the perspectives of ＂constructive realism＂ and ＂critical realism＂, and then construct a corresponding spiritual realism and historical realism to face the life world with a ＂mandala model of self＂ based on four levels: ＂morality＂, ＂knowledge＂, ＂desire＂ and ＂practice＂. Only by conforming to the objectives of Confucianism can the meanings of ＂Chinese and Western thought＂ and ＂Confucianism and Buddhism＂ be understood. Mature Chinese indigenous social sciences can truly encompass the nature of Chinese thought.

The True Self: The Effect of Relationships on the Expression of Chinese Authenticity,"Chien-Ru Sun, Cheng-Yu Chen","guanxi, self-relevant information, independent self, interdependent self, authenticity, behavioral compromise","The present research was designed to investigate the Chinese authenticity. Kernis (2003) defined authenticity as ＂the unobstructed operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise＂. However, the topic hasn’t been explored in Chinese culture. Therefore, based on the Authenticity Inventory (Kernis & Goldman, 2005) and the concept of social-oriented self-actualizers proposed by Yang (2003), we conducted experiments to explore the concept of Chinese authenticity. In Study 1, one hundred and six participants were assigned to a 2 (prime: independent self vs. interdependent self)×2 (guanxi-closeness: good friend vs. acquaintance)×2 (the degree of acceptance: high vs. low)×2 (self-relevant information: positive vs. negative) mixed design, with the last variable as a within factor. The main dependent measure was the degree of authenticity. The result indicated that low acceptance of negative evaluation from an acquaintance would be considered as more authentic. In Study 2, one hundred and twenty-one participants were assigned to a 2 (prime: independent self vs. interdependent self) ×2 (guanxi-closeness: good friend vs. acquaintance)×2 (the degree of compromise: high vs. low) between-subjects design. The result showed a significant three-way interaction, participants who were primed with independent self would rate behavior that showed low compromise to an acquaintance as more authentic. To sum up, this present study indicated that Chinese authenticity is more complicated than Kernis (2003) was defined. Chinese people often take ＂guanxi＂ into consideration when they decide how to act in different situations, and this doesn’t violate their concept of authenticity.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201806-201901080005-201901080005-157-206,49,2018,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Through participatory action research, we try to facilitate dialogue between researcher and practitioner. We aim at advancing our knowledge about the process of reaching couple consensus. It is also our attempt to develop a marriage education program which helps couple enrich their relationship. The key members of the PAR team include 3 college professors and 2 family educators. Monthly meetings and several group meetings in between are held to make decisions together and solve problems. We also conduct 4 focus groups to do need assessment, program consultation, and program evaluation respectively. Data are collected from 14 family educators, 5 male potential participants, and 10 program participants. Results of the focus groups indicate that, 'willingness' and 'atmosphere' are the premises of consensus. It is also found that when couples disagree with each other, husbands are concerned about reaching a tangible goal rather than dealing with the negotiation process. They also tend to avoid arguments in the consensus building process. As planned, a program based on indigenous research findings is developed. It is characterized as localization, pleasure, privacy, profession, and diversity. The program is then applied to couples with preschool children. In the process of recruiting participants and implementing the program, we run into difficulties such as husbands not interested in joining the program, children need special attention, etc. However, most program participants do experience enrichment in their marital relationship. Inputs from the program participants in the focus group also reveal that couple consensus is not always possible, nor necessary. Continuously communicating with each other and being able to take possible consequences may be more important. Through the whole process, researcher and practitioner are empowered by each other. Researchers reflected upon academic bias such as overlooking conditions of reaching couple consensus. Family education practitioners, on the other hand, value the program for it is distinguished from other programs that focus on skill practicing or counseling.

The Consequences of Coercive Power: The Moderating Roles of Chastening Norms and Leader-member Exchange,"Ying-Ni Cheng, Changya Hu, Chung-Yu Wang, Shih-Wen Chien","chastening norms, supervisor's use of coercive power, employees' identification with the supervisor, leader-member exchange","This study examines the influence of supervisor's use of coercive power on employees' identification with the supervisor and the moderator effects of leader-member exchange (LMX) and chastening norms. Early LMX researchers characterized the positive effects of LMX. However, recently the opposite influence has also been found. This study aims to clarify the influence of LMX and the impact of chastening norms (the way in which a supervisor requests their subordinates to improve their performance by adopting disciplined and strict attitudes, and setting up a high requirement goals and standards). In analyzing 294 workers, research show that the negative relationship between supervisor's use of coercive power and employees' identification with the supervisor is attenuated when employees possess high levels of chastening norms and high LMX. These results show that employees with both high and low LMX do not accept their supervisor's use of coercive power. However, if employees believe that chastening norms are appropriate, high LMX employees would thus consider their supervisor's use of coercive power a practice of tough love. We suggest that management should try to develop a trusting relationship with employees before using coercive power. However, developing a good relationship alone (LMX) is not enough to negate the consequences of the supervisor's use of coercive power. Results show that high LMX employees would still show a decrease in their identification with their supervisor (i.e., be hurt more by their supervisors actions) when they do not agree with chastening norms. The more implications of investigating Chinese culture and social exchange for understanding the impact of supervisor's use of coercive power are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201806-201901080005-201901080005-277-327,49,2018,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Effect of Significant Other's Advice on Forgiveness in Chinese Culture,"Chia-Ping Lin, Chien-Ru Sun","advice, forgiveness, hurt scenarios, relationship, Chinese culture, the significant other","We investigated the possible impact of significant others on Chinese people's decision to forgive. Past research has mainly focused on the effect of the victim's attributions regarding the offender's motivation on the decision to forgive. We suggested that because Chinese people have an interdependent self-construal that emphasizes relationalism, a significant other's opinion may play an important role in the decision to forgive. In Experiment 1, 113 participants were asked to imagine that they were victims in 3 types of hurt scenarios caused by their partner (i.e., money loss, relationship damage, and involving other people). They were then randomly assigned to one of the following advice situations: Advice from parents, from a good friend, or the no-advice control condition. The degree of forgiveness was submitted to an advice condition by hurt scenario ANOVA, with the hurt scenarios as a within-subjects variable. We found that advice from a good friend worked especially well in the relationship damage and involving other people situations. Participants reported a significantly higher level of forgiveness in those conditions than in the no-advice condition. Experiment 2 aimed at examining the nature of the advice from the significant other. A total of 88 participants were asked to write down the most harmful interaction they had previously experienced, and then were randomly assigned to a 3 (bogus forgiveness inclination feedback: already forgiven/not forgiven yet/control)×2 (advice condition: false forgiveness advice from a good friend/no advice) between-subjects design. The result indicated that instead of facilitating the decision to forgive, the significant other played a role in deciding whether or not to forgive.

Proper Voicing: Emotion Refinement in Parent-Adolescent Conflicts,"Wen-Tso Ho, Kuang-Hui Yeh, Chieh Lu, Louise K. W. Sundararajan","proper voicing, emotion regulation strategies, emotion refinement, parent-adolescent conflict, cognitive reappraisal, suppression","Most studies on emotion regulation have not applied a process-based view, and have thus ignored the dynamics of the context. We used the framework of Chinese emotion refinement theory and a process-based perspective to examine emotion regulation strategies in parent-adolescent conflict in two studies. Proper voicing entails temporarily inhibiting one's emotional reaction while in conflict, savoring one’s emotional experience, self-reflecting, and then appropriately sharing these emotions with parents. We developed a measure of proper voicing and then conducted a correlational study to identify the relation of proper voicing to positive outcomes in Study 1. A total of 761 Taiwanese teenagers (mean age = 16.6) from four high schools in northern Taiwan completed our questionnaire. S.E.M. analysis of the results showed that the more participants used proper voicing the higher their well-being score. The effect of proper voicing on teenagers' well-being was equal to cognitive reappraisal. In addition, the effect of proper voicing on satisfaction with the parent-adolescent relationship was positively stronger than the effect of reappraisal or suppression. We interviewed 7 college students (mean age = 18.4) in Study 2. Using thematic analysis, we identified three steps in the process of proper voicing that were congruent with our theory: leaving the scene, collecting oneself, and sharing with parents. We concluded that proper voicing demonstrates the research potential of a process-based perspective to enrich research on emotion regulation and to develop ecologically valid strategies for improved mental health.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201712-201807120002-201807120002-57-119,48,2017,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Authority-sensitization can be considered the implementation of the Confucian respecting the superior (zun-zun) principle. We conducted two scenario studies to investigate the operation and discriminant validity of authority-sensitization (Study 1) and its ethical implications and social adjustment (Study 2). In Study 1, a sample of 199 participants demonstrated that most participants would habitually notice whether an authority figure is present and exhibit respectful behaviors (e.g., standing and bowing) immediately when encountering an authority figure. In addition, authority-sensitization is different from interpersonal sensitivity, because of their weak shared correlation. In Study 2, among 167 participants those who showed high authority-sensitization accorded with the subordinate role were perceived to have better social adjustment and to be more likely promote by the superior than those who did not show authority-sensitization. No such pattern was found in horizontal relationships. The findings suggest that authority-sensitizatin operates in vertical relationship and exemplifies the ＂zun-zun＂ ethic of Chinese relationalism.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201712-201807120002-201807120002-121-165,48,2017,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Guanxi-trust: The Logic of Practice of Chinese Peoples' Trust,Yun-Long Chen,"guanxi, trust, Chinese culture, relation-trust","There are two routes in Chinese people's trust problem research. One puts it into the western dualistic paradigm, another connects it to Chinese's guanxi. But I choose the third way. Based on a general relation-trust analysis framework with a time-space dimension and with some other survey data and daily experience, I argue that the trust structure of Chinese people can be divided into four significant zones: easy trust, reliable trust, assurance trust and high-risk trust. The zones of relation-trust entail categorization mechanism and correlative mechanism under different running processes. Relation-trust presents an extremely complex logic of practice because it varies with the time and place. It not only can be expanded and strengthened through guanxi, renqing (favor or personal obligation), mianzi (face), and power, but also leads to the separation of the form and reality of itself. It tends to give rise to a formalism crisis. Finally, I refine the relation-trust framework, position, compare and clarify the core limitations of the western and indigenous trust researches, then point out the key goal and possible paths for future research into Chinese people's trust.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201712-201807120002-201807120002-167-230,48,2017,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Using the Mandala Model of Self postulated by Kwang-Kuo Hwang as the core, I developed the Mandala Model of Religion and Self as an analytical framework for religious mechanisms. This framework provides a systematic analysis of the mechanisms for religious commitment activated by death anxiety. Based on theoretical and empirical studies of personal religiosity and diffused religions, I draw from the psychological concepts of the mortality salience effect and continuing bonds to propose two hypotheses: (1) Religious commitment mechanisms are activated by death anxiety (especially among people with intrinsic religious orientation in institutional religions). (2) Mortality salience may increase death anxiety for individuals who attend a traditional Chinese funeral and temporarily activate religious commitment mechanisms. After modeling the religious commitment mechanisms activated by death anxiety, I apply them more generally to a traditional Chinese funeral and related rituals. The result is a critical realist analysis of Chinese dual belief in Heaven and spirits.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201712-201807120002-201807120002-231-277,48,2017,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

This study analyzes and evaluates 3 counseling models that integrate Eastern and Western elements (self-relation coordination, psychological displacement, and rational-emotive self-esteem) proposed by 3 Taiwanese psychologists (Chen Ping Hwa, Jin Shuh Ren, and Wu Li Chuan). The analysis indicated that Chen’s concept of self-coordination includes the most Eastern cultural elements. A domestic community has gradually formed around Jin’s psychological displacement technique, and Wu's counseling model originated from criticism of a local parenting style, but has made no further development.

In addressing these challenges, Chinese scholars' have made use of different strategies which indicate the pursuit of to address cultural subjectivity, that is, the subjectivity upon the legitimation of asserting cultural basis to psychology. In this article, I outline the strategies underlying the works of Kuo-Shu Yang, Kwang-Kuo Hwang, Wen-Li Soong, and Der-Huey Yee, and delineate how they responded to the challenges. Kuo-Shu Yang portrayed indigenized psychology as a strategy for asserting cultural subjectivity. Kwang-Kuo Hwang advocated cultural-inclusive psychology as a strategy for addressing cultural subjectivity to challenge by applying the philosophy of science as a platform for addressing the hegemony of Western psychology. Wen-Li Soong traced the origins of modern usage of Chinese language and suggested that this knowledge supports a cultural psychology of Chinese language.

Previous research has shown that Chinese people who are experiencing a breakup tend to down-regulate their negative emotions by listening to sentimental ballads, many of which encourage people to view their breakup experience from a positive perspective. The present study explores the artistic nature of the verse-chorus form of sentimental ballads, and the mental therapeutic effects of this form in terms of song contents and listeners’ mental processes. We analyzed the meanings of Mandarin sentimental ballads in terms of historical context and contemporary norms, clarifying the characteristics of different song passages. A finger temperature measurement experiment (39 participants, mean age = 22.5 years) and a brain-imaging experiment (15 participants, 21-26 years-old) provided valuable information about the relationship between song lyrics/music and resilience. The results suggest that changes in the lyrics and musical arrangement in the third chorus may be critical to mental therapeutic effects. The mid-posterior temporal cortex may be involved in semantic and musical processing, while the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex and the inferior frontal gyrus may integrate song information to down-regulate negative emotions. Our preliminary findings have implications for the role of emotion-cognition interactions in music therapy.

The Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem: How to Untie the Gordian Knot for Chinese Culture,Fu Chen,"nousism, nouslogy, Gordian Knot, Chinese culture, philosophy of science, Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem","Hwang Kwang-Kuo's interpretation of the philosophy of science from the perspective of multiple philosophical paradigms has highlighted a problem in the development of Chinese indigenous social science. It is difficult to tackle this problem methodologically. It is not clear how to allow the essence of traditional Chinese culture, which ＂combines humans and Heaven＂, to blend with the speculative scientific process, which involves opposition between humans and heaven. As Hwang put it, it is necessary to apply philosophy of science to identify scientific micro worlds from people's life worlds. Hwang integrated three religions (Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism) to propose a new conceptual basis for Confucian humanism. He argued that ＂Chinese learning emphasizes fundamental structure, while Western learning emphasizes practical uses＂. Hwang constructed a universal Confucian value concept using formative theory. In other words, he built a culture-inclusive theory using his Mandala Model of Self and his Theoretical Model of Face and Favor. He used this theory to reinterpret Confucianism, and then continued to describe the morphostasis of Confucianism in the pre-Qin period from a morphogenesis perspective, allowing him to complete the third modernization of Confucianism. However, as Hwang Kwang-Kuo's interpretation of self is confined to social meaning, and he interpreted Confucianism from the perspective of interests, he failed to see the unique nourism and kungfuism that exist in Confucianism. Hwang needs to first solve its plight before he can solve his problem. Faced with the repeated confusion and entanglement of traditionalism and modernism, researchers of Chinese culture are facing a long-term Gordian knot. If scholars do not thoroughly expose the essence of Chinese culture that encompasses traditional belief in the combination of human and Heaven, Hwang's problem will be tied up by an even more intractable knot on top of the existing Chinese cultural knot. On theoretical and practical levels, I combined psychological theories to propose how Chao Chin-Chi's three principles of authenticity and unperturbedness can provide the methods for solving the Hwang Kwang-Kuo Problem and helping Chinese indigenous researchers to study how to unlock the Gordian knot.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201612-201708090007-201708090007-73-110,46,2016,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Three studies were conducted by using scenario experimental method to evaluate and measure different types of conditions. Most of participants were college students; there were 83 participants in study 1, 178 participants in study 2, and 92 participants in study 3.The analysis resulted in two main findings. First, we found that participants expected an owner to voluntarily offer a reward if someone returns their lost property. However, they also expected the returner to politely refuse the reward. We attribute this response to cultural norms relating to moral obligations. Second, we found that participants who acknowledged the legislative purposes were also influenced by the concept of obligation. They not only supported the position that the person who picks up the lost property should comply with the legislative purposes to the higher level, they also expected the owner to voluntarily perform his/her obligation and responsibility. The results highlighted the importance of obligation in Chinese culture. If one party does not perform his/her obligation and responsibility, the other party in entitled to litigate, which maintains balance and fairness between the two parties.

＂Under My Control＂ or ＂In the Government's Hands?＂ The Influence of Cultural Identity and Extended-Self Identity on Political Participation in Taiwan and Mainland China,Han-Yu Hsu,"political participation tendency, national identity, cultural identity, extended-self identity","National identity is an important issue in the domain of political psychology. The aim of this paper is to provide a model of how national identity influences an individual's political participation through cultural identity and extended-self identity. According to the theory of extended-self (or big-self, 大我 in Chinese), I argue that due to the intricate nature of nation and culture, the extended-self identity is influenced by cultural identity. As political participation capture one's action tendency in political sphere, I argue that extended-self identity and cultural identity should predict the individual's tendency for political participation. Data were collected using the following measures: The cultural identity scale, extended-self scale, political efficacy scale, and the external political attitude scale. Participants included 153 Taiwanese (mean age = 36.61) and 144 Chinese (mean age = 34.86). The results revealed that (1) cultural identity can positively predict extended-self identity, and extended-self identity can positively predict political participation; (2) Taiwanese social-identity extended-self is a full-mediator of the effect of Taiwanese cultural identity on collective political efficacy; (3) Chinese social-identity extended-self is a partial-mediator of the effect of Chinese cultural identity on collective political efficacy, while Chinese social-identity extended-self is a full-mediator of the effect of Chinese cultural identity on external political attitudes; and (4) collective political efficacy among Chinese is significantly lower than that among Taiwanese. The results thus support the constructed model. Differences between the Taiwanese and Chinese models of self identity are discussed. Identity and political participation are further discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201606-201608250003-201608250003-3-56,45,2016,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

We investigate the superior mediating effect of individuating autonomous (IA) capacity and relating autonomous (RA) capacity between perceived need-supportive parenting (NSP) and adolescents' intrapersonal-domain and interpersonal-domain adaptation with analyses of cross-lagged structural equation modeling. We recruited 1,419 10th grade students using a two-year longitudinal design to test the hypotheses. Results demonstrated that: (1) perceived NSP not only positively contributed to Taiwanese adolescents' one-year-later IA and RA capacities, but also facilitated their oneyear- later adaptation; (2) the IA capacity at T1 primarily mediated the effects of perceived NSP on adolescents' intrapersonal-domain adaptation (sense of well-being) and maladaptation (anxiety tendency) at Year 2, while the RA at T1 primarily mediated the effects of perceived NSP on adolescents' interpersonal-domain adaptation (social skill) and maladaptation (deviant behavior) at Year 2.

"Implicit Affection in Taiwanese Couples: Gratitude, Forbearance, and Marital Satisfaction","Tsui-Shan Li, Ying-Ling Hsiao","gratitude, marital satisfaction, forbearance, implicit affection","This study investigated the feeling and expression of gratitude and forbearance in Taiwanese couples, and their effect on marital satisfaction. Data were drawn from the Taiwan Social Change Survey 2011 data set, and consisted of 1,173 married or cohabited individuals. The results indicated that the feeling of gratitude was significantly higher than the expression of gratitude in Taiwanese couples, which implies the phenomenon of unspoken gratitude. We also identified gender differences. Men experienced more feelings of gratitude and showed higher frequencies of 3 different kinds of forbearance behaviors: suppression, concession, and tolerance. Regression analyses revealed that for both men (age 40-65, with an education level above college or under junior high school) and women (under 65, with only a high school degree or less), feelings and expression of gratitude both significantly positively correlated with the individual's marital satisfaction. Only in men did forbearance predict marital satisfaction. Suppression correlated with decreased marital satisfaction, while tolerance correlated with an increase. This relationship was especially true among the 40-65 age group and those with only a junior high or lower education. In sum, our findings highlighted that the feeling and expression of gratitude, as well as different types of forbearance had different effects on marital satisfaction for men and women. For men, the expression of gratitude showed higher effects on marital satisfaction, while tolerance rather than suppression was also beneficial to his marriage.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201606-201608250003-201608250003-93-128,45,2016,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Toward the Healing Process of Chronic Illness: Exploring the Psychological Experiences of Hemodialysis Patients,"Yaw-Sheng Lin, Hung-I Lee","corporeality, existential experience, fistula, hemodialysis","This article explores the existential experiences of the patients who suffer from end-stage renal disease with regular hemodialysis. We applied a phenomenological method with purposive sampling. Ten (7 female and 3 male) chronic hemodialysis patients who gave informed consent were interviewed once for one hour. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed. The results revealed four themes, namely, ＂the device merging into life experience,＂ ＂existential awareness of time spent in dialysis,＂ ＂displacement to medical regimen as caring,＂ and ＂trajectory of dialysis and life healing＂. The illness experience went beyond the medical regimen. Hemodialysis patients' situations are embedded with ambivalent feelings about their corporeality when in treatment towards the daily life. We reached the following conclusions: (1) The situated structure of the renal dialysis experience: The machine as part of the self, the temporality as meaning disclosure, the situation as daily life, and healing process as 'hi' (虛) and 'bǔ' (補) complementarity. (2) Body awareness of dialysis: Ambivalence about the body combined with absent body that bodily experiences place in a background disappearances and hyper-appearing body that situates in the mode of sensitive awareness of the bodily vicarious experiences. The outcome deepens the reflections on the caring ethics to patients to appreciate the unique 'order of meaning' lying at the heart of their suffering experiences. Ethical healing is the cornerstone of relational understanding towards the human subjectivity rather than the medical positivism which targets to control and prediction human chaotic state of mind in an over-simplistic objectification way.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201606-201608250003-201608250003-129-174,45,2016,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Two important puzzles regarding missionary identity entrepreneurship remain unsolved. First, why does a person with a missionary identity become an entrepreneur? Second, how do those with a missionary identity externalize their values through entrepreneurship to shape a collective social identity? To answer these two questions, we interviewed typical missionary identity entrepreneurs in Taiwan. The results of our analysis indicated that formation of a missionary identity entrepreneur is highly related to environment and culture. There are three stages in this process: personal identity, entrepreneur role identity, and collective social identity. These three stages share the same core values, but they have different forms of expression because of different environmental factors. Based on these findings, we proposed a theoretical model of missionary identity entrepreneur development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201512-201601180004-201601180004-3-71,44,2015,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

We adopted the actor-partner interdependence model (APIM) to examine gender differences in the above process in couple dyads. Survey data were collected by structured questionnaires from 490 Taiwanese dual-earner employees (245 married couples). Results from structural equation modeling analyses showed that WFE mediated the relationship between supervisory support and emotional exhaustion. Based on the APIM comparisons, we found that the relationship between an individual's own WFE to his/her own emotional exhaustion was stronger for wife participants than for husband participants. Furthermore, for wife participants, her own WFE was a stronger predictor than her husband's WFE on the wife's own emotional exhaustion whereas husband participants' emotional exhaustion can be predicted by both his own WFE and his wife's WFE.

Results showed that when imagining experiencing a negative event, high zhong yong individuals eventually wrote fewer high-arousal negative emotion words and more low-arousal positive emotion words than low zhong yong individuals. In contrast, when imagining experiencing a positive event high zhong yong individuals increased their use of low-arousal negative emotion words sooner than those low in zhong yong.

A qualitative study was conducted in which 18 participants (10 men and 8 women) were interviewed regarding their experiences interacting with authority figures (e.g., parents and teachers) since childhood. The narratives were analyzed based on the principle of hermeneutic circle. The results showed there are 4 stages in the formation of AO: pre-AO, instrumental, obligational, and habitual. After the pre-AO stage, authority-dread and authority-dependence appear in the instrumental stage. Authority-reverence and authority-obedience develop in the obligational stage. In the habitual stage, the psychological and behavioral modes learned during previous stages become habits reflecting authority-sensitivity. The components emerging from the latter stages do not substitute for the earlier ones, but instead supplement them, meaning that the formation of AO goes from simple to complex. Chinese AO as described in this study was compared with Yang's AO and with authoritarian personality as defined in the Western literature.

With nearness to death, this approach to psychological healing with companionship is grounded in the primary experiences of human existence and thus goes far beyond the range of mainstream psychotherapies. The theory of anima care, however, was left unfinished as Dr. Yee passed away in 2012. It is necessary to complement his theoretical articulation of anima care in order to advance this indigenously-originated psychological healing approach and connect it with the various theories of psychotherapy. This paper proposes temporality as the core concept for comprehending the experiences of anima care; the experiential transformation of temporality, and spaciality correspondingly, is essential for anima care. Accordingly, this paper illustrates experiences of time and space in anima care.

Our participants were three married couples and one wife whose husband declined interview request. The average age was 35.57 years old. Using narrative analysis, our results indicated that: (1) When acting one's role in accordance with social expectations, frustration and conflict give individuals an opportunity for introspection. Furthermore, married individuals have to negotiate with the ＂selves＂ of their spouses. (2) Individuals need to perceive themselves as acting beyond social expectation, answering the question of whether it is possible to keep multiple selves when facing pressure from both cultural norms and interdependent relationship requirements. Individuals need to be self-reflexive and strike a balance between gratifying others' expectations and transcending the view other people have of them.

The Effect of Perceived Parenting Styles on Adolescents' Dual Filial Belief: A Mediational Analysis,"Shih-Jhe Huang, Kuang-Hui Yeh","gratitude, situational compliance, parenting, dual filial piety model, committed compliance, parent-child intimacy","The purpose of this research is to investigate the critical factors that mediate the influence of perceived parenting on adolescents' dual (reciprocal and authoritarian) filial belief. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was adopted to analyze the data and validate the hypotheses. Study 1 focused on the influence of perceived authoritarian and authoritative parenting on adolescents' authoritarian filial belief. Analysis revealed that perceived authoritative parenting exerts significant positive impact on adolescents' authoritarian filial belief, which is completely mediated by the adolescent's committed compliance to parents. Although perceived authoritarian parenting had a similar positive effect, its influence was not mediated by the adolescent's situational compliance to parents, mainly due to the lack of significant predictive power of situational compliance for the adolescent's authoritarian filial belief.Study 2 examined the influence of perceived authoritative parenting on adolescents' reciprocal filial belief, with the modification of assessing the data of the father and the mother separately to cross-validate the results of Study 1. Study 2A revealed that an adolescent's situational compliance mediates the relationship between the perceived father's authoritarian parenting and the adolescent's authoritarian filial belief towards the father, but not for the mother. Other findings were the same as Study 1. Study 2B demonstrated that perceived authoritative parenting has a significant positive impact on adolescents' reciprocal filial belief, which is mediated by the adolescent's gratitude to the parents. However, the mediating effect of parent-child intimacy was supported only in a single-mediator but not dual-mediator (gratitude and intimacy) model.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201306-201312310001-201312310001-119-164,39,2013,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

To answer this question, Chinese fidelity was examined by studying related ancient texts and through an interview using the narrative inquiry method with a male murderer whose wife was unfaithful. The analysis resulted in 5 themes: the themes of obedience and self-restraint, the husband's expectations and setbacks with regard to his wife's role practice, the conflict arising after his wife had extramarital affairs, the struggles and violence after divorce, and insight into his mental illness and his self-cultivation in jail.

In sum, these studies failed to find evidence supporting TMT. These results are especially surprising considering the strong evidence from past TMT studies. The author next systematically examined empirical studies in psychology, and found that: (1) many main stream theories (e.g., TMT, construal level theory) are difficult to be replicated, and that (2) the empirical studies presented in the psychology literature are very unreasonable when considering statistical power.

The two leadership constructs examined were (1) a new western positive leadership construct, authentic leadership, and (2) a type of Chinese-specific positive leadership, benevolent leadership. Using a two-stage data collection procedure, an empirical study was conducted with a valid sample of 378 subordinates in Taiwan. Structural equation modeling results suggested authentic leadership and benevolent leadership are empirically two different constructs. We found a strong significant relationship between benevolent leadership and loyalty to supervisor, as well as between authentic leadership and loyalty to supervisor, but the former was stronger. There was a significant relationship between authentic leadership and organizational citizenship behavior, but not between benevolent leadership and organizational citizenship.

Relational vs. Personal Contextual Thinking in the Process of Impression Formation,"Chien-Ru Sun, Wan-Jung Chen","assimilation effect, contextual thinking, contrast effect, dynamic construct, impression formation","Two experiments were conducted to investigate whether information about relational others has an effect on people's impression formation and how relational-contextual and individual-contextual thinking styles affect the process of impression change.In experiment 1, participants read information about relational others first, and then information about a target person. We hypothesized that when relational-contextual thinking was activated, a contrast effect would occur. In other words, information about relational others leads to certain expectations, and the closer the relationship was, the stronger the expectation would be. Thus, when the subsequent information about a target person was opposite to the expectation, the greater the expectation, the greater the impression change. The results supported the hypothesis: Impression change was greater in the parent-information condition than the friend-information condition. In experiment 2, participants' individual contextual thinking was activated by reading the target person's information first. It was predicted that after forming a basic impression of the target person, participants would use the impression to assimilate the subsequent information about relational others. The closer the relationship was, the easier the assimilation would be, and as a result, the impression change would be smaller. The results of experiment 2 supported the hypothesis: The impression change was smaller in the parent-information condition than in the friend-information condition.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201206-201301100043-201301100043-1-56,37,2012,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Guanxi adjustment and guanxi interactions are discussed from the perspectives of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucian ethics. Based on this analysis, a model describing the operation of yuanfen (Chinese determinism) and the psychological adaptation processes in guanxi interaction is proposed. The model is used to explain shared human mentalities and to interpret specific aspects of Taiwanese behavior. Building on the results of past research, a tentative theory to describe guanxi interaction and psychological adjustment among Chinese is offered.

Using a pop culture lens, the possible influence of pop romance novels on Taiwanese couples relationships was explored through an examination of how pop romance texts present intimacy, and the messages they convey. The texts of six Qiung Yao romance novels were analyzed qualitatively to ascertain the bonding process of couples and the ways that the couples in the novels deal with conflict with the goal of discovering whether they influence readers' real intimacy behaviors. The analysis identified four dynamics that seem to facilitate the bonding process: good impression, determination and painstakingness, fear of loss, and social recognition. Characteristics of first reactions when couples face conflict, coping strategies for conflict, and the process of conflict resolution were also identified.

The Meaning of Work and Family and its Role in Coping with Work and Family Conflict: Practicing the Chinese Bicultural Self,"Luo Lu, Ting-Ting Chang, Yu-Yueh Chang","composite self, meaning of work and family, work and family conflict, individual- and social-oriented self","Most research on work and family has been conducted in a Western context. From the perspective of ecological systems theory, each culture shapes the development of its people through the shared value system, family structure, and educational institutions. Culture plays an important role in the study of work and family. As work and family conflict can be stressful, the ”meaning” that an individual gives to certain roles or stressors is a key factor affecting perceived strain and influencing the choice of coping strategies. One's view of oneself is the foundation of individual psychological functioning as well as one's interactions with others, groups, and the larger society. It also shapes the meaning of work and family for an individual. The present study take the vantage point of the self, namely the individual-oriented self, social-oriented self, and composite self, to explore how individuals construct the meaning of work and family, and how it in turn affects the interface between work and family.We used in-depth qualitative interviews to draw on the rich life experiences of participants to understand how they make sense of work and family conflict. We used these narrative accounts to identify the influence of self view in the construction of the meaning of work and family, in the experience of work and family conflict, and in the effort to resolve conflict. Results indicated that people with different views of self did experience work and family interactions differently. The meanings of work and family are subjective, and based upon these personal convictions, people devote different levels of effort and adopt different strategies to cope with work and family conflict.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201206-201301100043-201301100043-141-189,37,2012,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

After critically reviewing the extant literature and theoretically comparing with similar Western theories, namely leader-member exchange and servant leadership, we identify two constituent behavioral dimensions of BL: life-oriented and work-oriented considerate behaviors. We further propose and test a preliminary model concerning the antecedents, namely supervisor's obedience-to-authority orientation and perception of subordinate's loyalty, and the consequences, namely subordinate's extra-role behavior and in-role performance, of dual dimensions of BL. Our two samples comprised leader-follower dyads organizations situated throughout Taiwan using survey research techniques. Results from structured equation modeling (SEM) techniques supported our hypothesized model.

The analysis showed that when the person in the moral-face threatening situation was a family member and had a reasonable excuse for misbehavior, participants indicated a less feeling of losing face and tended to choose a friend to help. If the family member did not have a reasonable excuse for the behavior, participants indicated a greater feeling of losing face and chose a stranger to help. When the one in distress was a friend, participants' feeling of losing face was low, and they tended to choose a familiar person to help whether or not this friend had a good excuse for misbehavior.

A dyadic analysis of parent/child work values revealed that children are more likely than their parents to emphasize the values stressed in instrumental relationships and less likely to emphasize values related to intimate or mixed relationships. Children emphasized work values such as self-actualization, altruism, social respect, monetary rewards, aggression and competition, openness, and respect for individuals. They identified their parents with values such as self-actualization, creativity, altruism, balanced life, harmony and face, forgiveness, and humility. However, children also inherited values from their parents; the parent-child relationship moderated value transmission.

Thus, we examined the exercise of forbearance and its relation to psychological adjustment. Five forbearance practices including suppressive, avoidant, transference, empathic, and self-cultivating were distinguished and measured. 202 Taiwanese undergraduate students participated in the current study. Cluster analyses showed that the Flexibility with Ease group, defined as having the flexibility to express or exercise forbearance across different situations, tended to have the best psychological adjustment. Furthermore, individuals who tended to combine empathic and self-cultivating strategies demonstrated adaptive states. To sum up, forbearance can be practiced in different ways.

Innovation and Mass Production in Enterprises: The Effect of Confucian and Christian Cardinal Relations,"Ching-Fuh Lin, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","cardinal relations, mass production, Confucianism, paternalistic leadership, Christianity, entrepreneur, innovation","The recent economic prosperity of Chinese societies has attracted the attention of many scholars. Many attribute their economic success to Confucianism. Rapid economic growth in China appears to make it a challenging opponent to the western world led by the U.S. This paper compares the cultural foundations of economic development in China and the U.S., Confucian cardinal relations and Christian cardinal relations, to identify the cultural impact on the organizational behaviors and products of entrepreneurs. In Confucian cardinal relations, leader-subordinate relations are particularly emphasized. In contrast, in Christian cardinal relations, relationships between equal partners are more valued over other types. The flexible attitude toward human relations in Christianity increases the variety of social contexts and further enhances innovation of entrepreneurs. In contrast, the fixed attitude of human relations in Confucianism adversely influences innovation in entrepreneurs. Evidence is provided by the big difference of technology trading ratios between Taiwan and the U.S. Nonetheless, the strictly fixed relationship of paternalistic leadership in Confucianism helps mass production. In particular, modern industry requires mass production of broadly varied items at a timely pace. Confucian cardinal relations promise the possibility of governance over more than half a million people in one single corporation that has revenue equivalent to, but employees outnumbering, its counterpart in the U.S.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201106-201203020021-201203020021-100-141,35,2011,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The results revealed that unclear parental function, imbalance of authority and responsibility in the marital relationship, preference for males in the gender role expectation, guilt associated with the offspring's enmeshment, and the struggle for position in the sibling relationship were among many factors that precipitated the development of parentified experiences. Furthermore, the impact of parentification on the self development of the young adult women included: sensitivity to the needs and evaluations of others, and the tendency to neglect personal emotions and needs, sacrifice in order to gain attention and position, a tendency to endure unfairness and maltreatment in a relationship, and to pursue achievement and approval. Parentification is in fact a painful process for offspring, but it can be argued that within its constraints is the potential for developing tenacity and resilience. Applications and suggestions for practices and future research are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-201006-201012060115-201012060115-59-106,33,2010,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Differential Leadership and Subordinate Effectiveness in Chinese Context,"Ding-Yu Jiang, Wan-Chen Chang","differential leadership, employee effectiveness, supervisor fairness perception, power distance","Recent studies proposed that differential leadership is a specific leadership style in Chinese business organizations. In 1995, Cheng defined differential leadership as when leaders treat subordinates differently depending on whether the subordinate is an in- or out-group member. The aim of this study is to develop a measure of differential leadership based on Cheng's research findings. Participants included 312 employee from various Taiwanese organizations. Among participants 201 (64%) are females and most participants were aged from 26 to 30 years old (31%). Results indicated that: (1) Differential leadership consists of 3 major components, including supporting communication, rewarding promotion, and trusting tolerance. (2) After controlling for the effect of paternalistic leadership, differential leadership still had a positive association with job performance. (3) Subordinates' power distance had a significant moderating effect on the relationship between differential leadership and subordinates' perception of supervisor fairness.

The Counseling Principles of Dao's Approach Based on Lao-tzu's Humanity Theory,Jin-Hui Hung,,"The purpose of this article is to explore Lao-tzu's theory of human nature and to establish counseling principles based on this approach. Lao-tzu's theory of human nature is based on 3 contexts: awareness of relativity, being, and universe. There are 3 main findings about Lao-tzu's view on mental health: the development of relativistic awareness, the increase of open and feminine perspectives, and spontaneity. Together they can be labeled a Fan (反, regaining) philosophy.
Besides, Sage is the ideal human being who acts on the nature of Wu Wei (無為), the philosophy of Fan, feminine communication under the perspectives of relativity, being, and universe context.

Development and Validation of a Brief Version of Chinese Marital Affection Scale,"Ying-Ling Amy Hsiao, Tsui-Shan Li","Taiwanese couples, scale development, marital affection, dyadic data analyses","The purpose of the study was to develop an abbreviated form of the Chinese Marital Affection Scale (MAS) originally designed by Li in 1999. Two sets of samples with a total of 349 married couples living in northern Taiwan were used. The first sample set was used to confirm the factor structure of marital affection through confirmative factor analysis; this resulted in a scale of 4 factors: gratitude, appreciation, togetherness, and tacit understanding. Using dyadic analyses, a series of competing models was established and evaluated. Based on the principle of parsimony and previous theories, one second-order factor was retained as the model of best fit. The internal-component fit evaluation showed good reliability, convergent validity, and discriminate validity in both observed and latent variables. The second sample set was used to cross-validate and to confirm stability and predictive power for the hierarchical model with one second-order factor. The final procedure was to test the criterion-related validity of the brief form of the MAS. The results showed strong associations with 2 validity-related measures (marital satisfaction and marital stability). Moreover, actor-partner interdependence model showed that a person’s affection towards his or her spouse was more associated with his or her own perception of the quality of the marriage, and less related to the marital quality of the spouse. The study failed to confirm the hierarchical model with 2 second-order factors including en-qing and intimacy. Future research should verify the nature of the MAS in more diverse samples. In sum, the brief version is less time consuming and constitutes a reliable and valid alternative to the original MAS for clinicians and researchers.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200912-201012060114-201012060114-3-40,32,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Patterns of Coparenting Processes,"Ya-Ping Lin, Huey-Ya Lin","coparenting, patterns of parental coparenting processes","The present study explores the patterns of dynamic processes of parental coparenting. Five pairs of parents who were dual-earners and who had children in elementary school participated in the present study. Based on content analyses of depth interview of participants, the results showed 2 patterns of dynamic processes of parental coparenting: One parent dominates and the other goes along, and each parents in his or her own way. Within the dominator pattern there were 2 subtypes: Mother dominates and father dominates. Among these patterns, there were several interesting discoveries in the present study. First of all, supportive coparenting might have two different meanings: Parental support reflected interparental agreement regarding parenting goal and practices, and parents who performed their support only tried to maintain surface consistence. Secondly, keeping silence might look like the action of supportive coparenting, however, the parent who kept silence and the child might form the relationship of alignment. Finally, factors such as the amount of time of parental involvement, the power of childrearing decision-making, individual pattern of facing conflict, and consideration about the child might contribute to the patterns of dynamic processes of parental coparenting.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200912-201012060114-201012060114-41-97,32,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Dual Filial Piety Model in Chinese Culture: Retrospect and Prospects,Kung-Hui Yeh,"reciprocal filial piety, Chinese culture, authoritarian filial piety, dual model, indigenous psychology","The concept of filial piety has a long tradition in Chinese culture and has been through several transformations. The Dual Filial Piety Model was constructed to elucidate the concept and resolve contradictions over whether it is beneficial or harmful to individuals. The central goal of this article is to explore this dual model framework comprehensively, linking theory with empirical results. First, I trace the theoretical development of the Dual Filial Piety Model and expound the meanings, characteristics, and implications of each filial aspect as well as the relationship between them. In addition, I address the development of a standard measure of dual filial piety, which has been supported by empirical research. Next, I review empirical results from a series of studies to illustrate the explicit functions and mechanisms of reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety and their corresponding effects on individual adjustment in order to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical model. Finally, in order to show the diverse applications of the dual model framework, I review the literature citing the Dual Filial Piety Model, which includes topics such as parent-child conflict, adolescent problem behavior, elderly care, intergenerational exchange, and family counseling. I use the literature review to address potential issues and to recommend the model as a powerful tool that should be used as a basic guide for future research on filial piety to clarify research questions and interpret related phenomena.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200912-201012060114-201012060114-101-148,32,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
In Harmonious Yet Different Worlds: Exploring Psychological Experiences and Co-constructive Illness Events from the Dyadic Relationship between Stoma Patients and their Primary Care-giver,"Yaw-Sheng Lin, Mei-Jung Chen","illness experience, caring, dyad, sense of we-ness, beyond normality","This paper explores the psychosocial reactive experiences and lifestyles of cancer survivors, and the caring experiences and coping strategies of their primary caregivers using participant observation, interviews, and interpretive phenomenology. Five patient-caregiver dyads (4 male and 1 female patients; 4 female and 1 male care-givers) were interviewed an average of 2.4 times each at a hospital in southern Taiwan over a 2-year period. The average duration of illness was 16.2 months. The average duration of care was 14.6 months. In the last interview, the depression scale was administered to the cancer patients as an adaptation index after a chronic illness. Results showed cancer patients and their caregivers shared a similar psychosocial process. After the cancer event, they both felt their biographies could be narrated metaphorically. They felt 'The life trajectory is out of the daily rotines'. Through the narrative line, the life trajectory could be drawn to the routined order as before. However, the cancer assaulted their lived world; their life story changed ontologically. The patients and their caregivers constructed different lifestyles from each other, which not only presented limitations, but also revealed their adaptations for the patients. But from the caregivers' view, the illness caring experiences might be the burden processes for the maladaptive dyad. The analysis showed that a sense of we-ness can enhance mutual intimacy and empower a relationship. By enacting the we-ness care pattern, the clinical psychologist and related mental health workers could offer healing by taking care of their biological, social, and psychological needs and ensure positive new trajectories.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200912-201012060114-201012060114-251-325,32,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Intergenerational Exchange Behaviors in Taiwan: The Filial Piety Perspective,Kuang-Hui Yeh,"intergenerational exchange, dual filial piety model, filial belief, intergenerational solidarity theory","The aim of this study is to examine how three intergenerational solidarities (family structural, associational, and normative solidarities) influence 3 aspects of intergenerational exchange behavior (financial, family labor, and affection exchange behavior) in Taiwan. In consideration of the Chinese cultural context, we focused on individual filial belief (as normative solidarity) as a key predictor of adult children's exchange behavior towards their parents. Analyses of national representative data, including 1463 adult samples varying in gender, age, occupation, marriage status, and educational level etc., collected by the Taiwan Social Change Survey (TSCS; Phase 5 Wave 2) in 2006, demonstrated that family labor and affection exchange behavior between adult children and their parents occurs according to the principle of reciprocity while financial exchange behavior accords with the rule of demand. That is, the more family labor and affection parents provided, the more support their adult children gave in return. Financial exchange behavior between generations showed the opposite pattern. When parents had greater need, adult children provided more. After controlling for the influence of family structural and associational solidarity, the children's reciprocal filial belief still had a positive association with financial support, family labor, and affection towards parents, but their authoritarian filial belief had a positive association only with supporting family labor. Most of the hypotheses were supported. Actually, the effect of family structure and associational solidarity on intergenerational exchange behavior, in the Chinese cultural context, can be reinterpreted and encompassed by adult children's reciprocal and authoritarian filial belief as well.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200906-201003120005-201003120005-97-141,31,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Survey data were collected from 179 subordinates in 40 departments belonging to 28 companies. Most of the respondents are at the entry level, such as sales, clerks, junior engineers. Political behavior was rated by coworkers. Position perception was measured with a graphical semantic scale. The other variables were measured by self-report scales. The results demonstrated that position perception negatively affected attitudes towards procedural justice. However, position perception was not significantly related to subordinates’ political behaviors. Moreover, trust among coworkers was found to mitigate the effect of position perception on subordinates' political behaviors. These findings call for attention to the question of why Chinese leaders tend to rely on differential management in spite of its negative effect on subordinates’ attitudes and behavior.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200906-201003120005-201003120005-143-175,31,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Upper Echelon's Configuration and Strategy Formation in Chinese Organizations,Sy-Feng Wang,"strategy formation process, paternalistic leadership, structural hole, differential matrices, social network analysis","Leaders of organizations have strategies for dealing with the functional issues of internal integration and external adaptation. However, as they like to keep these strategies private, the processes used to form such strategies are not well understood by researchers. Research on these strategy formation processes have only recently been initiated in Taiwan. Based on the paternalistic leadership model and the differential matrices model, we propose the following: (1) In those organizations characterized by paternalistic leadership and the differential matrices models, the social structure of top level leaders (upper echelon) is what Ronald S. Burt called ”structural hole”. (2) When the upper echelon's interaction rule is dominated by control logic, the structural hole social structure will induce a power-leading strategy formation process; when it is dominated by information logic, the structural hole social structure will induce ”take the golden mean” position and ”dialect and emerge” strategy formation processes. (3) When all else is equal, the ”dialect and emerge” process will produce more innovative and higher quality strategies than the ”take the golden mean” position and the power-leading process; the ”take the golden mean” position will produce higher quality strategy than the power-leading process. One longitudinal case study research in a reputed apparel corporation affirmed these propositions. The theoretical meanings are discussed and compared to the upper echelon perspective theory. The compounding phenomena of paternalistic leadership's effect on corporate performance are also discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200906-201003120005-201003120005-177-246,31,2009,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Mediating Process of Trust and the Moderating Effect of Emotional Intelligence on a Chinese Supervisor's Authoritarianism Leadership and a Subordinate's Job Satisfaction and Organizational Commitm,Tsung-Yu Wu,"emotional intelligence, trust in supervisor, authoritarianism leadership","Previous research concerning authoritarian leadership focused on the relationship between the supervisor's authoritarianism and the subordinate's response. Few studies have explored the mediating processes and boundaries of this relationship. This study investigates whether degree of authoritarian leadership in a Chinese organization predicts the subordinate's job attitude (job satisfaction and organizational commitment) through the mediating process of trust in supervisor. I also explore the moderating effect of emotional intelligence on the relationship between authoritarianism and job satisfaction. Analysis of survey data from 249 employees of various companies in Taiwan indicated that the supervisor's authoritarianism predicts the subordinate's job satisfaction and organizational commitment through the mediator of trust in supervisor. The ”others' emotional appraisal” (OEA) component of emotional intelligence significantly moderates the relationship between authoritarianism leadership and job satisfaction such that the relationship is more strongly negative for subordinates with high OEA. However, the ”regulation of emotion” (ROE) component of emotional intelligence did not have significant moderating effect.

Exploring the Antecedents of Authoritarianism Leadership in Chinese Enterprises: The Predictive Effects of Supervisors' Obedience-to-Authority Orientation and Their Perception of Their Subordinates' C,"Tsung-Yu Wu, Li-Fang Chou, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","fear, obedience-to-authority orientation, compliance, authoritarianism leadership","Authoritarianism leadership is a style unique to Chinese supervisors. It consists of authority and control, underestimation of subordinate competence, image building, and didactic behavior. Past studies related to authoritarianism leadership have focused mostly on its consequences, with specific attention to the reactions and attitudes of subordinates. The antecedents of authoritarianism leadership have been seldom discussed. Further, although paternalistic leadership theories suggest that subordinates compliant and fearful reactions are the result of authoritarianism leadership, whether a supervisor's perception of these reactions intensifies or reduces the authoritarianism behavior remains unknown. This study focuses on whether supervisors' obedience-to-authority orientation and perception of subordinates' compliance and fear predicts the level of their authoritarianism behavior. We also investigated whether supervisors' obedience-to-authority orientation moderates the relationship between supervisors' perception of subordinates' reactions and authoritarianism leadership. We administered surveys to employees in Taiwan and collected 510 Taiwanese manager-subordinate paired surveys. Supervisors' obedience-to-authority orientation and perception of subordinates' compliance and fear were found to significantly predict supervisors' authoritarianism leadership behavior. When supervisors had stronger obedience-to-authority orientation, they displayed more authoritarianism behaviors. When supervisors perceived more compliance from subordinates, they reacted with fewer authoritarianism behaviors. However, when supervisors perceived more fear, they reacted with more authoritarianism behaviors. Supervisors' obedience-to-authority orientation was not found to moderate the relationship between supervisors' perceptions of subordinates' compliance and authoritarianism leadership. It did significantly moderate the relationship between supervisors' perception of subordinates' fear and authoritarianism leadership. When supervisors' obedience-to-authority orientation was high, supervisors exhibited more authoritarianism behavior, despite the level of fear they perceive from their subordinates. In other words, for supervisors with a higher obedience-to-authority orientation, the relationship between their perception of subordinates' fear and their authoritarianism leadership was less strong. Supervisors with a lower obedience-to-authority orientation displayed a stronger relationship between their perception of subordinates' fear and their authoritarianism leadership. The implications, limitations, and direction for future research are discussed at the end of the paper.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200810-x-30-65-115-a,30,2008,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The method to carry out this study was using a purposive sampling of questionnaire survey and the participants were expected to respond anonymously who lived in Taiwan. Four hundred married adults age 30 to 40 with at least one parent still alive participated in the study. They live in the northern part of Taiwan and were recruited through purposive sampling. Several 5-point Likert type scales used in previous research were adapted in this study. Results indicated that adult children who feel a high degree of filial obligation have less anxiety over their ability to meet their obligations, but they have more anxiety over their aging parent's well-being. Satisfaction with the parent-child relationship corresponded to decreased anxiety over ability to meet filial obligations. The number of siblings as well as the parents' health status has no significant effect on the feeling of filial obligation or anxiety. There were some differences between the men and women: Women had more filial anxiety over their aging parent's well-being than men, those living with a parent had a stronger sense of filial obligation than those who did not live with a parent, those whose parents lack financial resources had greater anxiety over their own ability to meet their filial obligations.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200810-x-30-155-197-a,30,2008,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Three patterns of adolescent perception of family relationships were identified: closeness and supportiveness, conflict but with connection, and estrangement and conflict. Adolescents indicating the closeness and supportiveness pattern perceived significant higher levels of supportiveness, communication, trust, and closeness than the other two patterns. They also indicated the highest level of well-being. Adolescents in the conflict but with connection pattern perceived higher levels of conflict, but also perceived connection with parents and siblings and supportiveness between parents.

The approach of regarding Ren as a strategy of coping specifies not only its constituents, but also how it operates in various contexts. Adhering to this approach, Ren was conceptualized as a psychological process with multiple mechanisms, which was defined by various experiences occurring at different stages toward the same social object. Meanwhile, special attention was given on how people transform in the process of Ren. Considering Chinese Relationalism, the vertical relation was viewed as the most important interpersonal context for the operation of Ren. A qualitative study was conducted to explore various experiences of Ren in vertical relations. Eighteen participants (7 males and 11 females) were interviewed for approximately 2-3 hours each to elicit their experiences of self-transformation in the process of Ren. Analysis of their narratives identified five stages of self-transformation, and were labeled as ”pre-forbearance”, ”self-repression”, ”self-compartmentalization”, ”self-exceeding”, and ”flexible self” in a sequential order. The vicissitudes of relationship between individual and authority were discussed by means of analyzing the dynamics between ”Xiao-wo” (the individual self) and ”Da-wo” (the authority figure): as the strength of an individual's self increases, it may counterbalance the power of authority figure, and the individual may become capable of being autonomous. Thus, we concluded that the self may transform in the process of Ren.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200804-x-29-3-76-a,29,2008,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

This study tested whether conflict and ren behaviors mediate associations between affection/belief and quality of marriage among Taiwanese couples. Data were used from a sample of 352 married couples aged 20-73 of which 70% had children under 18, drawn from a study conducted in the Taipei area. Relations among affection (intimacy and en-ching), beliefs in ren (beneficence, utility, mercy, commitment), conflict behavior (attack and complain), ren behavior (repression, receptiveness, and endurance), and marital quality (satisfaction and stability) were examined. Structural equation models showed the mediating effects of conflict and ren behaviors. The results indicated that husbands and wives who have more affection for their spouse and hold stronger beliefs in ren tend to adopt frequently ren coping strategy in dealing with marital disputes. Engaging more ren behavior was related to less conflict behavior and less conflict behavior was associated with higher levels of marital quality.

Four female adult clients with their couples received 8 to 10 counseling sessions including both individual and couple counseling sessions. Each of the counseling sessions lasted to one or one hour and half. Each client also received one interview session to provide feedback after completing the entire course of counseling. A total of 38 counseling sessions and four interview sessions were videotaped and transcribed for data analysis. The principles of grounded theory were adopted for analysis. The major research findings were: (1) the core themes of relationship disturbance included the source of conflict in the relationship, conflict coping response, and the client's conflict in the inner self; (2) the self-coordinating process in counseling involved the concurrent development of both the individual and relational self. In order to improve couple relationship, all clients initiated the self-coordinating process with their couples. The process was characterized as unique as well as dynamic; (3) the self-coordinating process was facilitated by the willingness to make change of the client, the new awareness of both individual self and couple relationship, direct expression and communication, respect for the other, the mutually affective responses, and the continuity of the changing behaviors. The main conclusion of the study is: Although the course of the self-coordinating process varied for each client, the concurrent development of the individual self, particular in the affective, communicative, and expressive aspects, are helpful to increasing satisfaction with both the self and the relationship development.

Her growth occurred through insight into her experiences with her transitional family as she came to realize the loss of her father's love in a psychoanalytic sense. Jia-mei then rebuilt links with her real family members and returned to her family and school life.

Chinese Implicit Theory of Personality-Behavior Association and Its Impact on Interpersonal Interaction,Kung-Yu Hsu,"interpersonal interaction, acquaintance process, implicit theory, Chinese personality","This study explores Chinese implicit theories of personality-behavior association and the impact of these implicit theories on interpersonal interaction behaviors in a first encounter with new person. Yang's (1999) 10 Chinese personality perception dimensions (competent, impotent, industrious, lazy, extraverted, introverted, other-oriented, self-centered, agreeable, and disagreeable) were used to construct 10 interaction scenarios involving a person displaying a particular dimension. A conceptual analysis of the various kinds of behaviors associated with these 10 dimensions was also conducted. We tested the hypothesis that implicit theories associating personality dimensions and behaviors have an impact on interactions by decreasing or increasing interpersonal threat. When the implicit theory decreases the interpersonal threat, further interaction with the target is sought. In contrast, when the implicit theory worsens the interpersonal threat, interaction with the target is terminated. Analysis of the responses of 728 Taiwanese undergraduates on the 10 interaction scenarios indicated that all behaviors stemming from the implicit theories of other-orientedness and agreeableness decreased interpersonal threat and increased interaction with the target person. Behaviors associated with impotence, self-centeredness, disagreeableness, laziness, and introversion increased interpersonal threat and eliminated further interaction. Behaviors associated with competence, industriousness, and extroversion decreased some threats and increased others with the result that participants tended to show more complicated interaction with the target. Results are discussed in terms of interpersonal interaction in Chinese culture.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200702-x-27-3-79-a,27,2007,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Relationship of Coparenting to Parenting Feelings among Preschool Children's Parents,Huey-Ya Lin,"coparenting, parenting alliance, parental involvement, parenting stress","This study examines the association between coparenting (the degree to which parents perceive spousal support or undermining with respect to their childrearing practices) and parental feelings about parenting. Participants were 622 pairs of Taiwanese parents with children between 5 and 6 years old. All were married to the biological parent of the child; no step-families were included. Participants responded to measures of parenting alliance, parental involvement (i.e., division of labor in childcare and the amount of time of interaction with the child), and parenting stress and satisfaction. Analysis showed that parents tended to perceive a supportive parenting alliance and have a high level of involvement. They felt a low level of parenting stress and a high level of role satisfaction and happiness. Fathers felt they had a higher level of spousal support than mothers. Mothers were the main caregivers and they felt a higher level of parenting stress regarding child rearing, life adjustment, and social interaction, and a lower level of happiness than fathers. Parents' perception of the level of spousal undermining was an important factor contributing to all aspects of parenting stress. The perception of a supportive parenting alliance and high division of labor in childcare contributed to positive feelings about parenting. Mothers' perceptions of the amount of time spent on father-mother-child interaction contributed to maternal positive feelings about parenting.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200702-x-27-177-229-a,27,2007,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Differences in the Cognitive Representations of Emotional Intelligence between Taiwanese Managers and Emotional Intelligence Instructors,"Chung-Kwei Wang, Kuo-Ying Lo","Individual-oriented emotion intelligence, social-oriented emotion intelligence, Ren-qing Shi-ku","This study examines whether Taiwanese managers without emotional intelligence (EI) training interpret EI differently from EI instructors. Results showed that Taiwanese EI instructors adopt individual-oriented North American EI concepts that emphasize intrapersonal emotion management skills for understanding, displaying, and managing emotions and regard EI as the skill of being oneself. In contrast, Taiwanese managers were social-oriented and interpreted EI as interpersonal emotion management skills that emphasize inner emotion cultivation such as integrity and selflessness, consideration and caring, and keeping peaceful feelings under stress. They also believe that EI is similar to renqing shiku, a traditional Chinese social intelligence concept emphasizing the ability to cater to others' needs and have harmonious relationships.

Family and Marriage Research in Taiwan: A Review of Post 80's Studies,Szu-Chia Chang,"marriage, psychological approach, Taiwan, family","This article reviews family and marriage research published in psychology journals in Taiwan over the past 20 years. The literature on families can be divided into six categories including parent-child relationships, intergenerational relations, family functioning, family values, the meaning of home, and divorced and single parent families. A clear emphasis on the parent-child relationship was identified along with focus on other intergenerational relationships such as those between in-laws or between grandparents and their grandchildren. There was also concentration on the meaning of home. Analysis of the research on marriage also revealed 6 main topics: premarital relationships, marital satisfaction, marital conflict, marital adjustment, intimacy, and violence in marriage. The first three of these topics have received the most attention. An overview of recent trends and advances in the study of family and marriage is provided and the issues that represent research opportunities for psychologists are identified.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200608-x-26-3-34-a,26,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Beyond Mother-Daughter Affection: Multiple Harmonies for Mothers- and Daughters-in-Law,"Shih-Chi Hsu, Li-Li Huang","interpersonal harmony, mother- and daughter-in-law, indigenous methodology, interpersonal conflict, family relationships","Culturally Chinese people expect the relationship between mothers- and daughters-in-law to be as close as mothers and their own daughters. However, some mothers-in-law can not avoid conflict with their daughters-in-law. The harmonious ideal for their relationship is changing due to transformation of the family system, and there are now various possibilities for how they can relate to one another. The dynamic model of interpersonal harmony and conflict is used to draw distinctions among a variety of conceptions of relationships.
Thirteen in-depth interviews were analyzed. Results indicated that in modern Taiwanese society, there are 4 harmonious relationship types between mothers- and daughters-in-law: equal sisterhood, affection, obligatory role fulfillment, and efficient co-worker. Some differences in interaction principles and emotion exist among these 4 types, which may be arranged along two dimensions: intimacy/distance and superiority/inferiority. The core components of a harmonious relationship between a mother- and her daughter-in-law are obligatory role fulfillment and efficient co-worker. Those emphasizing the equal sisterhood component have more interaction, and are not restricted to household duties in their interaction. This type may be gaining prominence in modern Taiwanese society.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200608-x-26-35-72-a,26,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Critical Review of the Recent Development of Couple and Family Therapy Practices in Taiwan: A Comparative Analysis of 11 Case Clinical Studies,Wen-Tao Chao,"case study, family therapy, marital counseling, Taiwan indigenous psychotherapy, clinical practice","Numerous studies in Taiwan have indicated a connection between mental illness and patients' family systems and called for systemic intervention. However, to date, couple and family therapy is little practiced in Taiwan. This study entails a review of 72 relevant studies from 1992-2004 and a qualitative comparative analysis of 11 clinical case studies in terms of theoretical approach, problem assessment, therapeutic process, and treatment outcome. Results indicated: (1) a variety of therapeutic disciplines, settings, and presenting problems; (2) little theoretical diversity, with the structural approach and the Satir model prevailing; (3) publications of theoretical discussion outnumber those of clinical practice, and the therapy process has tended to rely on theoretical frameworks and correspondent techniques; (4) descriptions of the therapy process have tended to focus more on therapist intervention and less on the family's experience; and (5) there has been little emphasis on Taiwanese culture, which sometimes can play a critical role in therapy. Implications of this study include the need to (1) promote the practice of couple/family therapy in Taiwan and enhance collaboration across disciplines; (2) enrich the diversity of theoretical approaches in clinical practice; (3) establish practice-oriented raining programs, and cultivate experienced clinical supervisors to help local therapists transform their theoretical knowledge into clinical practice; and (4) pay more attention to and conduct more research on the role of culture in family therapy.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200608-x-26-73-107-a,26,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Are Personality Adjectives Categorized along the Chinese Big Seven Personality Dimensions? An Examination from the Retrieval-Induced Forgetting Effect,"Chin-Lan Huang, Yi-Cheng Li, Yei-Yu Yeh","social cognition, retrieval practice paradigm, retrieval induced forgetting, Chinese big seven, interpersonal perception","This study adopted the retrieval practice paradigm[11] to test whether the structure of the Chinese big seven personality dimensions characterizes how culturally Chinese people perceive and categorize a person. The retrieval practice paradigm can be used to reveal the structure of conceptual representations by showing that retrieval practice of exemplars of a category induces forgetting of unpracticed exemplars as compared to unlearned stimuli. Experiment 1 followed the procedure [12]used in Macrae and MacLeod's (1999) study of person perception with a retrieval practice paradigm. Results confirmed that the retrieval-induced forgetting effect cannot be produced with personality adjectives that are randomly organized from the 7 dimensions. Experiment 2 used the same adjectives as in the first study, but had two retrieval practice phases. Results showed that once stable impressions were formed, a reliable retrieval-induced forgetting effect can be obtained. Homogeneous adjectives were drawn from 4 of the personality factors in Experiment 3. The retrieval-induced forgetting effect manifested after only one retrieval practice, suggesting that stable impressions can be established after one exposure. Results support the conclusion that the Chinese big seven model is the primary structure used by culturally Chinese people to organize their interpersonal information.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200608-x-26-111-140-a,26,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Convergence and Divergence under the Feminist Umbrella: Genealogy and Transformation of the Feminist Cool Family,"Li-Li Huang, Yin-Kun Chang","feminist consciousness, gender mainstreaming, queer studies, feminism, men's studies, feminist identification","Feminism originally emerged in a Western context with a meaning related to the women's movements. It has expanded as a belief system so that is now like an ideology to counter patriarchy and hegemony. The women's movement in Taiwan went through four stages historically, and is now entering a stage in which queer studies and men's studies are allying with the feminist camp, constituting an interesting coalition, which in this study is labeled the feminist cool family, as an umbrella term and metaphor. Members of the feminist cool family share a common theoretical background and insight, but their goals and ultimate concerns are not always the same. This study analyzes the convergence and divergence of these 3 camps. Data from 36 feminist informants were collected using face-to-face in-depth interviews taking about 1.5 hours each. According to the analysis, although informants had different levels of feminist identification, it was clear that feminism had influenced them despite some variation in meaning. In addition, the process
of feminist consciousness and identification exhibited convergence among the feminist cool family, and divergence from certain perspectives such as feminist subjectivity, hierarchical relationships within feminists, and the myth of sisterhood on the other hand. Finally, results suggest that the concept of gender mainstreaming is a possible strategy to integrate different standpoints in the feminist cool family.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200608-x-26-141-182-a,26,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
From Superficiality to Genuineness: Harmonization Processes and Transformation Mechanisms between Mothers- and Daughters-in-Law,"Li-Li Huang, Shih-Chi Hsu","interpersonal harmony, mothers-in-law, daughters-in-law, transforming mechanism, interpersonal conflict, family relationships","Previous studies on the relation between mothers- and daughters-in-law emphasized relational conflict and used static models to identify sources of conflict. They concluded there is no way to improve negative relations and neglected either the dynamic process of relational transformation or the dyadic interaction. This study used the dynamic model of interpersonal harmony and conflict to explore the constructive harmonization process and conflict transformation mechanisms between mothers- and daughters-in-law. Analysis of interviews conducted with 8 mothers-in-law and 11 daughters-in law (not paired) revealed 2 possible courses of relational transformation. All participants maintained relational harmony early in the relationship, hiding discomfort out of fear of face-to-face conflict. In the second stage, if mutual obligations as daughter- and mother-in-law were fulfilled, their relationship became one of genuine harmony (GH), meaning that outer behavior matched hidden emotions. However, if mutual obligations were ignored, their relations were characterized by superficial harmony (SH), meaning outer behavior did not match hidden emotions related to conflict. Three phases of GH were identified: GH forms as each fulfills role obligations and affection (chin-yi), GH develops as genuine instead of obligatory affection is expressed and the negative emotion resulting from hidden conflict transforms to positive emotion and cognition, and GH is reinforced as drop their role obligations under the Chinese patriarchal hierarchy and no longer fear face-to-face conflict. Three phases of SH were identified: SH is maintained when obligatory role affection is ignored, SH becomes fixed if role obligations are not fulfilled, and SH becomes outright conflict frequently involving other family members. For both types of harmony the 3 phases differed according to the intensity of the relationship and progress of time. Interpersonal conflict between mothers- and daughters-in-law is a dynamic process. The mechanism for transforming hidden conflict into positive relations is the key to improving the relationship. Developing and reinforcing GH supports positive relationships between mothers- and daughters-in-law better than avoiding face-to-face conflict.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200604-x-25-3-45-a,25,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Conjugal congruence was defined as the degree to which a couple shares values, attitudes, emotions, and behavioral intentions as measured by Yang et al.'s (1991) Multidimensional Scale of Chinese Individual Traditionality (MS-CIT) and Multidimensional Scale of Chinese Individual Modernity (MS-CIM). The reliability and validity of these measures was also tested. One hundred fifty pairs of married couples completed structured questionnaires. Analysis revealed that conjugal congruence on individual traditionality/modernity is related to marital adjustment: (1) When the husband scored higher than the wife on individual traditionality, the greater the conjugal incongruence on overall traditionality or its component male superiority, the poorer the marital adjustment of both parties. (2) When the wife scored higher than the husband on individual modernity, the greater the conjugal incongruence on overall modernity, the poorer the marital adjustment of both parties. And, (3) the reliability and validity of the short forms of the MS-CIT and MS-CIM were acceptable.

In the second stage, 19 people were interviewed who believed themselves to have a satisfactory marriage after experiencing adversity. Analyses of the interview data revealed a process of development of marital resilience involving interaction of 3 major forces: the individual's personal belief system about marriage, hardships, and life; the individual's active and passive coping strategies; and the constant give and take or ren (忍, a Chinese concept similar to tolerance) in the marriage system.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200604-x-25-101-137-a,25,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

All members (97 participants) of 24 intact families residing in northern Taiwan were interviewed about their daily interactions and solutions to conflict. Analysis revealed: (1) Some beliefs and values were still highly maintained, including striving for achievement and virtue in order to manifest family prosperity, and emphasizing self-inhibition, modesty, courtesy, submission to seniors, and mutual cooperation for family harmony. (2) The male superiority power structure has somewhat declined, although role obligations are still highly evident. (3) Some communication patterns that rely on nonverbal communication and taken-for-granted knowledge, or on passive and indirect strategies for handling conflict were strongly maintained.

The Strategies of Trust in Chinese Society,"Yi-Wen Wang, Liang-Chun Chen, Kwang-Kuo Hwang","customary trust, social trust, Chinese relationalism, culture psychology, relation network","This paper addresses the unique features of social trust in cultural Chinese societies. A review of the literature on trust indicated that it is very difficult to use theories of trust developed by Western scholars to explain the prevailing phenomena related to trust in culturally Chinese societies. Because interpersonal trust is generally supported by the value system and social norms underlying the meaning of life in a given culture, it is necessary to consider the cultural context when investigating the process of trust. A conceptual framework based on Confucian relationalism is proposed to analyze the domains and features of five prototypes of trust in culturally Chinese societies. Two of the prototypes concern trust within a person's intimate social network, namely kinship trust and emergent trust constituted on the grounds of shared identity. The other three concern trust of social targets outside person's intimate society, including customary trust derived from cultural customs, professional trust relying on the professional knowledge and ability of the trustee, and institutional trust established through rational calculation to maximize personal interests in dealing with an institution. A person may adopt different trust strategies depending on the relation with the trustee. Implications of each prototype of trust are elaborated.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200604-x-25-199-241-a,25,2006,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Furthermore, we explored the adaptational values of these important psychological attitudes for the contemporary Taiwanese people. Using structured questionnaires, we surveyed 670 college students and their parents from all over Taiwan. Among them 281 parent-child dyads were paired and their data were the main source for further statistical analyses reported in the paper. There were three main findings: (1) within the parent-child dyads, parents scored higher on psychological traditionality than their children, whereas children scored higher on psychological modernity than their parents; (2) within the parent-child dyads, parents and their children were no different on scores of either traditional filial piety or neo-filial piety. Furthermore, traditional and neo-filial piety were shown to be a well-integrated conception; (3) within the parent-child dyads, neither parties' psychological traditionality or modernity could predict subjective well-being (SWB). However, children's SWB was predicted by their own filial piety and the parents' expectations of their filial piety, whereas parents' SWB was predicted solely by their children's committed filial piety. The above results had meaningful implications for the study psychological transformation involving traditionality, modernity, and filial piety.

Ethical Intervention and Spiritual Well-being as Cultural Therapeutics: Compound Psychological Healing in Culturally Chinese Societies,Der-Heuy Yee,"cultural psychotherapy, indigenous psychotherapy, ethics, mind-practice, Chinese psychology","This article investigates the possibility of indigenizing psychological counseling in culturally Chinese societies. To avoid the professional bias inherent in the medical discourse, a counter discourse is used to manifest cultural essence. The author does not oppose professionalizing Chinese psychological therapy, but hopes to localize Western psychotherapy by revealing the problem of survival and the existence of psychological healing at the root of Chinese culture. Localized psychological healing compounds ethical intervention with spiritual well-being-two aspects that form the core of psychological adjustment for culturally Chinese people. This basis is different from the discourse of Western psychological healing, which is rooted in Western cultural history. Culturally Chinese people accept ethics as the principles of social practices. These ethics combined with culturally Chinese people's transcendental perspective on the meaning of life form a complex psychology of the heart. When culturally Chinese people use this structure to transport their self-adjustment problems into a framework of the meaning of life, they believe that their external actions should be regulated by interpersonal ethics so as to attain world order. The most important goal of humans' inward activities is to cultivate virtuous thoughts such as benevolence and righteousness. However, life is not plain sailing. Not all human endeavors bring success and not all thoughts are good. For those who encounter difficulties and unpleasantness in life, cultural psychological healing is a good prescription. A culturally correct psychological healing should inquire into 2 problematic areas: (1) the language problem, and (2) equal emphasis on spiritual well-being and ethical practice. The necessity of these two aspects is due to the non-analytical character of culturally Chinese people and the quest for wholeness in the culture. Ethics and spirituality are interconnected. They expand the width and depth of psychological healing in society, infiltrating all realms of people's lives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200512-x-24-7-48-a,24,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Relocating Grieving Resolution: From Reconnection to Healing,"Min-Tao Hsu, Der-Hui Yee, Wei-Lun Lee","Taiwan, widowhood, death, bereavement, widowed family, culture","Using data from several interpretative ethnographic studies conducted in Taiwan from 1995 to 2002, the authors examine indigenous cultural patterns of suffering as they affect adaptation to loss from death. Participant observation and the narratives of 52 widows and 30 adolescents without fathers were used to generate an adaptive model of family bereavement. According to the findings, three themes-maintaining the status quo, restoring images of the deceased in family affairs, and communicating with the dead-represent the efforts of bereaved families to retain a sense of wholeness (a central Chinese goal) and to preserve symbolic images of fathers and husbands. The data indicate that the grieving process in Taiwan is clearly different from its Western counterpart, which emphasizes the concept of ”working through” as a major means of healing from bereavement. In Taiwan, reconnection rather than cutting-off relationships with the deceased dominate bereavement responses. Widowed mothers use local religious practices, mediums, and ancestor worship to locate deceased husbands, and teenagers create imaginary fathers to address a sense of incompleteness and failure that emerges from their father's deaths. Our conclusion is that reconnection is a culturally specific and accepted means of resolving grief among Taiwanese.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200512-x-24-49-84-a,24,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Indigenization of clinical psychology, however, is not often discussed in Taiwan although indigenization of other areas of psychology has been taking place for over 30 years. This article first discusses the necessity and possible directions of indigenous clinical psychology in Taiwan. Next, indigenization and its related methodologies are explored through the concept of indigenous match. Finally, the recent professional development in the United States of psychological assessment methods with emphasis on social and cultural contexts and their correspondence with life-world concerns is examined. Analysis of these topics points to the importance of ”context” for psychological phenomena and behaviors, and its role as a conversion point for indigenizing psychology, clinical psychological assessment, and existential phenomenology.

The Self-evaluation and Self-affirmation Process of Culturally Chinese People,"Chien-Ru Sun, Chung-Hsin Wang","social-oriented self, Chinese, self-affirmation, self-evaluation, independent self, interdependent self, individual-oriented self, self-handicapping","Numerous studies conducted in western cultures have demonstrated that the self-affirmation process is trigged when people experience a threat to their self-image and that it runs its course until the image is restored. As self-construal varies with culture, this study investigates the self-affirmation process of culturally Chinese people. In Experiment 1, 96 university students who had been prescreened with a social values scale were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions in a 2 (economic value orientation: high vs. low) × 3 (feedback condition: no feedback vs. positive feedback vs. economic subscale) factorial design. The main dependent measure of interest was the self-handicapping index. As predicted, the self-affirmation process reduced participants' tendency to self-handicap. Those who received non-contingent positive feedback still had a strong tendency to self-handicap. Facing possible impact to the independent self-image, the self-affirmation process was triggered to restore self-evaluation. In Experiment 2, 70 pre-selected theoretical-oriented culturally Chinese university students worked in pairs to complete a task. Threat to the interdependent self aspect was produced by giving the false negative feedback to participants that they were evaluated by the other party as performing inadequately as a partner. Participants were then randomly assigned to one of the following conditions: parent-son relationship affirmation, friend relationship affirmation, theoretical value affirmation, filler questionnaire, or the no feedback condition as the control group. The important dependent measures were the participants’ evaluations of the cooperative process and their partner. Those who filled out the parent-son relationship affirmation questionnaire, as well as those who received no negative feedback, made significantly better evaluations of the cooperative process and the partner than those in other conditions. That is, when experiencing negative impact on their interdependent self-construal, affirming important relationships, especially the one with parents, restores the self-image. When the interdependent self-aspect was threatened, self-affirmation on important personal values did little to restore self-evaluation. Implications are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200512-x-24-139-187-a,24,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Social- and Individual-oriented Views of Self-actualization: Conceptual Analysis and Preliminary Empirical Exploration,"Luo Lu, Kuo-Shu Yang","individual-oriented self-actualization, social-oriented self-actualization","Humans continually strive for the higher aspects of their own potentialities; to be more compassionate, loving, and creative; to create more exquisite poetry and arts; to prefect themselves and the world around them. In Western psychology, such striving is variously called ”self-actualization” (Maslow, 1970; Rogers, 1951), ”healthy personality” (Jourard & Landsman, 1980), ”ideal personality” (Allport, 1961) or ”optimal personality” (Coan, 1974). In the Chinese cultural heritage, Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism all have visions for the ”ideal person” or a ”perfect life”. Together the ideals of ”benevolence” (jen) in Confucianism, ”tao” in Taoism, and ”enlightenment” in Buddhism constitute the core construct of self-actualization for the Chinese people.
The present research started with a theoretical analysis of the discourses of self-actualization as embedded in the traditional Chinese and Western cultural contexts. Concepts of individual-oriented self-actualization based on an independent and self-contained self in the Western culture and those of social-oriented self-actualization based on an interdependent and ensembled self in the Chinese culture were elaborated. Subsequently, qualitative methods of focus group and essay writing were adopted to collect empirical data from Taiwanese college students. Analysis revealed three major constituents of views of self-actualization among the young Chinese generation. These were: to become oneself completely, to repay the family with personal accomplishments, and expanding personal well-being to serve the community. Finally, a tentative dialogue was attempted between the theoretical analysis and empirical interpretations, to reflect the lived reality of the East-West cultural fusion and integration for contemporary young Chinese regarding self-actualization.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200506-x-23-3-69-a,23,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Social- and Individual-oriented Self-actualizers: Conceptual Analysis and Empirical Assessment of their Psychological Characteristics,"Kuo-Shu Yang, Luo Lu","conceptual analysis, self-actualizers, social-oriented, individual-oriented, empirical assessment","This study systematically compares the common psychological characteristics of individual-oriented and social-oriented self-actualizers. The comparison is made at two levels, conceptual and empirical. The conceptual analysis of individual-oriented actualizers is based on Jung's (1916), Adler's (1930), Goldstein's (1939), Rogers' (1959), and Maslow's (1970) discussions on self-actualization, self-realization, the self-actualizer, and related concepts. The conceptual analysis of social-oriented actualizers employs the concept of junzi (君子) in the Confucian cultural tradition as the culturally Chinese prototype of a self-actualizer, and the life-long process of striving to be a junzi as the culturally Chinese version of self-actualization. The analysis relies on texts from Confucius and his disciples and followers and related scholarly discussions. The two conceptual schemes are used as guides to develop items to construct two scales to assess the psychological characteristics of the two kinds of self-actualizers.

Factors Involved in the Formation of Trust between Taiwanese Managers and Their Chinese Subordinates,"Chung-Kwei Wang, Kuo-Ying Lo","work value, instrumental trust, personal affect trust","Interviews with 22 Taiwanese managers and 13 of their Chinese subordinates revealed that the Taiwanese managers highly emphasize professional competence and work values such as loyalty, honesty, responsibility and cooperation. The Taiwanese mangers' prejudice against their Chinese subordinates prevented them from establishing close relationships with them. They also separated themselves from their Chinese subordinates both psychologically and physically with the result that there little feeling of trust between them. Both groups agreed that personal interaction would increase interpersonal trust.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200506-x-23-147-199-a,23,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Particularistic Ties and Interpersonal Affection within Chinese High-level Manager Networks: Effects of Deep-level Psychological Fitness and Formal Working Relationships,"Li-Fang Chou, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Chin-Hui Chen, Chin-Kang Jen, Chin-Tien Hsu","particularistic ties, deep-level psychological fitness, manager network, interpersonal affection","Researchers have acknowledged the importance of guanxi networks for Chinese managers' performance, but only a few related empirical studies have been carried out. Likewise, even though interpersonal affection has been highlighted as the key to long-term interpersonal interaction, very few studies have explored the relationship between particularistic ties and interpersonal affection in the context of manager networks. We asked 121 high-level managers to enumerate the critical people within their management network. Based on the 745 pairs of network ties acquired, we probed the effect of particularistic ties on interpersonal affection (including affective trust and closeness). We also examined the mediating effect of deep psychological fitness (including similarity in values and interests) and the moderating effect of formal working relationships on particularistic ties and interpersonal affection. Findings include the following: (1) The effect of particularistic ties on interpersonal affection is stronger than that of demographic homophily, and different types of particularistic ties have different effects on interpersonal affection; (2) Deep-level psychological fitness have a significant effect on interpersonal affection; (3) Except for relationships with family members, the effect of particularistic ties on interpersonal affection is mediated by deep-level psychological fitness; (4) For the influence of relationships with family members, past supervisors, and past colleagues on interpersonal affection, the manager's formal working relationship with important others have a moderated effect. Based on these findings, the actual content of guanxi in the context of Chinese organizations is: (1) the importance of particularistic ties (family, friends, supervisors, colleagues) on interpersonal interaction and affection is much more significant than that of demographic homophily; (2) supervisor's particularistic ties and affectionate relationships with important others demonstrate the concentric circles' differential mode of association as per Fei Xiaotong's theory; (3) deep psychological fitness is incapable of completely mediating the effects of family ties on interpersonal affection, which is a manifestation of the superiority of family ties in Chinese interpersonal affection; (4) the mediation effect of formal relationships and particularistic ties within organizations reveals the complexity and omnipresence of Chinese guanxi. The limitations of this study and direction for future studies are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200506-x-23-201-257-a,23,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Truth is Beyond Words: Reflection on the Mourning Processes of Earthquake Survivors from the Perspective of Ethical Turn Healing,Yaw-Sheng Lin,"Pathos, healing, Logos, trauma, Ethos","Western psychotherapy relies on a foundation of natural science to uncover the laws of nature that transcend time, place, and culture. However, it is technical rather than ethical, and neglects the spiritual and existential dimensions of psychotherapy (such as mythology, folklore, and ritual healing). This study first characterizes the epistemic approaches underlying modern science and philosophy through Stephen Pepper's world hypothesis theory and examines the different archetypes and metaphors of the helper from a historical viewpoint. Next, interviews with 20 bereaved survivors of the September 21, 1999 earthquake in central Taiwan collected over a three- year period after the disaster were analyzed using an interpretive interaction methodology. The recovery processes was interpreted with the Gestalt vision, which occurs in the situatedness of ”the analytical triad”. The healing strategies of the survivors were analyzed through the rhetorical tradition of the 3 doctrines, namely, Logos, Pathos, and Ethos in order to understand the possibilities for post-traumatic growth through the interaction of intrapsychic and social processes in a bereaved state of mind. Finally, the conceptual model of the ”ethical turn healing perspective” (ETHP) is proposed. The ETHP requires identifying new metaphors to account for human suffering, challenges the naturalism orientation, and underscores that it is the ethical rather than the technical that is the touchstone for human existence. The ETHP contrasts with the dominant models of the mourning process (”the grief work perspective”, ”the don't worry be happy perspective”, and ”the middle-of-the-road perspective”), which reduce the rich and varied complexities of the human world and moral activity to causal substrates.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200506-x-23-259-317-a,23,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Tattooing and Juvenile Delinquency in Taiwan,"Rueih-Chin Lin, Bin-Fei Huang","tattooing, tattooing attitude, juvenile delinquents","This study investigated the relationship between tattooing and delinquency for Taiwanese juveniles. Participants were selected from the population of juvenile delinquents in Taiwan by cluster sampling. 806 valid samples were obtained. Participants completed the Attitude Rating scale and the Behavioral Self-expression Questionnaire to assess attitudes and behaviors related to tattooing. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, t-test, and discriminate analysis. Of the total sample, 47.4% reported having permanent tattoos. More than half of the tattooed delinquents (56%) received their first tattoo between 13 and 15 years of age, and 83.8% were tattooed either by themselves or by friends. Those with severer sentences, more time in prison, and longer records of previous and especially violent crime, were more likely to have tattoos. Of the violent offenders, 59.6% expressed regret after getting a tattoo and 40.7% had had a tattoo removed. Peers played a key role as communicators of information and values, and models of behavior. The main motive to get a tattoo was curiosity. Females were more likely than males to have gotten a tattoo for fun or out of boredom or moodiness. Compared with non-violent offenders, violent offenders got tattooed because they felt bored and in order to prove identity with a gang. Those whose first-time tattoo occurred before age 12 tended to get tattooed to show identity with fellow gang members, and not for aesthetic appearances. Compared with those juveniles whose tattoos were self-administered or obtained from friends, juveniles whose tattoos were professionally administered were more likely to have been motivated by self-expression, fashion, aesthetics, luck, memorial, self-encouragement, or for gang identity. The tattooed delinquents had a more positive and favorable attitude toward tattooing than the non-tattooed delinquents. Education, records of crime, socio-economic status, number of friends with tattoos, and number of tattooed family member significantly differentiated 72.6% of the juvenile delinquents. Implications of this study for youth counseling and probation counseling are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200506-x-23-321-372-a,23,2005,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The second section examines the author's four-part theory of the Chinese self that is composed of the individual-oriented and social-oriented self, with the latter further divided into the relationship-oriented, familistic (group)-oriented, and other-oriented self. The four Chinese selves are then theoretically compared in terms of 15 major general psychological characteristics. In the third section, empirical tests of the four-part theory in the form of 13 studies on Chinese self-process, -concept, and-evaluation are elaborated. The coexistence of an individual-oriented and a social-oriented self and their differences are generally demonstrated by the results of the research on self-process. The coexistence of the four Chinese selves is consistently shown in the results of the self-concept and self-evaluation studies. The last section discusses the general implications of all the research findings for the four-part theory of the Chinese self, the directions and topics for future research in testing the theory, and the evaluation, improvement, and expansion of the research strategies and methods to be used.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200412-x-22-11-80-a,22,2004,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

An empirical research was first cited in this paper to illustrate the limitation of duplicating Western paradigm of psychological research in Confucian society. Based on another empirical research accomplished by Hwang (2003), a conceptual framework was proposed to classify life goals in Confucian society into three categories, namely, vertical distinctiveness, horizontal distinctiveness, and personal goal, and to discuss the differences among these three categories of life goals in terms of parental request, teacher's expectation, peer competition, social values, personal values, freedom of choice, reasons for choice, self-attribution following success or failure, and self-presentation. Finally, a series of empirical research accomplished with a reference to this framework were reviewed, and the specific moral meaning of effort for practicing one's role obligation was discussed.

Ethical Healing as the Starting Point for Indigenization of Clinical Psychology,"Der-Hui Yee, Wei-Lun Lee, Yaw-Sheng Lin, An-Bang Yu, Sue-Huei Chen, Min-Tao Hsu, Shieh-Bi Ling, Shieh-Ming Shieh","psychotherapy, ethical experience, indigenous clinical psychology, lifeworld healing, suffering","In this paper, we propose that an ethical experience other than interpersonal reciprocity constitutes a healing factor for people who are suffering. Ethics based on reciprocity in interpersonal interaction entail obligations that regulate interpersonal ordering such as those in the parent-child relationship. This understanding does not arise from direct empirical observations, but from a 4-year team research project in which team members explored different fields and topics of psychological healing in order to reflect on approaches appropriate to an indigenous clinical psychology. The research group first focused on some possible formations of indigenous psychotherapy for Chinese patients, such as somatization of depression, key factors of change in psychotherapy, the mechanism of healing in the dying process, and the matching of Chinese medicine to the mind-body conditions of Chinese people. After 2 years we found that this direction could not provide a solid standpoint for the development of an indigenous clinical psychology, and instead just manifested the difficulties of doing so. That is, compared with the huge body of Western psychological knowledge, the above ways of inquiry could only provide a kind of exoticism to Western knowledge. After the second year, we began to see that the match between Western psychotherapy and mental illness is similar to the match between Chinese healing operations and life suffering. In other words, development of an indigenous psychology requires returning to the real life conditions of ordinary people (their lifeworlds) and letting the logic of Chinese ways of behaving speak to these conditions, and letting the human relatedness built into the way of living in Chinese societies manifest itself in order to identify the factors related to suffering and healing in Chinese people's lives. After returning to people's lifeworlds, we found the key factor of
Chinese people's suffering was in the interpersonal ordering in which
they situated themselves, which is called ”the ethical”. We also found that ”the ethicals” were not about regulative principles, but about emotion. That is, people's feelings are subject to ”the ethicals”, which in turn is the key element relating to people's psychological health or suffering. People establish their own ways of healing in terms of building up ethical relatedness. In all examined conditions-the caregivers' attitude toward depressed or suffering patients, gathering for religious reasons, and the channeling of grief through interpersonal networking of people who lost loved ones-lifeworld healing was greater than expected. ”The Ethicals” in the lifeworld thus became the anchor of our indigenous psychology and also a starting point for our inquiry. Our research group did not stop at the territory of interpersonal ordering, we advanced further into the lifeworld and found that healing of ethical suffering did entail going back to fix the disordered, but rather withdrawing from systematic interpersonal ordering and disclosing the depth of ”the ethical acts in presence,” in order to relieve the emotionality of continuous interpersonal obligations. We also found that the reaction on the edge, the edge of our take-for-granted, could bring the suffered together with the caregivers into a journey of being ”inside out,” transform the indifferent to the concerned, and formulate the ”otherwise” ethical experience. This ”otherwise” ethical experience first registered itself in bodily level and became the basic condition for healing. To illustrate our understanding and to discuss related issues, this paper consists of 4 parts. First, we discuss the lifeworld as the standpoint for the development of an indigenous clinical psychology. Second, we review the results of our studies in the past four years, which focused on suffering in life rather than on mental illness in the medical system. This part of the discussion also describes the limitations of past studies as the starting point for our inquiry. Third, we then make clear the way we obtained the direction toward the ”otherwise” ethical experience as the key for healing. And forth, we reflect on the construction of the ”otherwise” ethical experience as the healing approach for indigenous clinical psychology.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200412-x-22-253-325-a,22,2004,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

This study investigated Chinese people's implicit self-esteem (ISE), a topic which has been relatively neglected, and explored the best ways to measure it. Three priming tasks and the Implicit Association Test (IAT) were employed to measure ISE. Two experiments were conducted and a total of one hundred and eighty three Chinese participants were randomly assigned to receive the IAT test or a priming task (I, self, or one's own name served as the prime). Results showed that use of a participant's own name as a priming task was the most effective way to measure the individual's implicit self-esteem.

Psychotherapy as an Ethical Act,Wei-Lun Lee,"psychotherapy, indigenous clinical psychology, the space of mystery, suffering and healing, ethical act","This study identifies ethical acts in psychotherapy, constructs a theoretical framework, and explores the structure of action for the therapist. The goal is to understanding therapeutic acts rather than patients through examination of ethical acts (defined as the construction of interpersonal ordering) occurring in encounters between therapists and their patients. First, seven recent studies concerning healing activities in Taiwanese society were examined in terms of phenomenological reduction. The conflict and reconciliation of persons in their collective lives outlined in these studies is discussed, and then directions of ethical action in psychotherapy constructed. Next, using empirical records as examples, concrete incidents from therapy were defined as ethical acts. Results showed suffering and healing are understood as whether ”personal pondering” gets ”thwarted” or ”channeled” within the interpersonal constellation in which it is situated. Cultivating individual ego strength is not the only way to channel personal pondering into the interpersonal field. It can also be achieved by linking thwarted personal pondering into a broad space of ”mystery” as a kind of channeling and self-placement, which further trigger a re-ordering of the interpersonal constellation. If this occurs, therapy is no longer aimed at individual ”inner conflict,” but the rearrangement of interpersonal ordering. Silencing the self-protecting ”individualized self,” bringing forward ”the self in channeling,” and re-ordering the interpersonal constellation in terms of connecting to a broad space of mystery, emerge as three possible ethical acts in psychotherapy. In addition to providing an alternative horizon for psychotherapy, this study supports the argument that defining psychotherapy as a series of ethical acts matches the preference for collectivity in Chinese societies. This study may therefore be understood as a fundamental work for developing theories and techniques of psychotherapy for people in Chinese societies.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200412-x-22-359-420-a,22,2004,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The sample consisted of 769 high school students' parents in Taiwan, a total of 362 couples' data were recruited.
Data from the analysis showed that different forms of marital affection were the better predictors of conflict management patterns than different forms of marital power. In addition to direct effects between marital affection and conflict management patterns, there were also indirect effects between marital affection and conflict management patterns through spouses' conflict management patterns. Reciprocity of conflict management patterns was also found in the dyadic interactions between husband and wife.

Results indicated that husbands involved in fewer child-care tasks than wives did. Correlation analyses revealed that significant relationship existed between family value and child-care task involvement among wives, while significant correlation was found between fairness value and coparenting behaviors among husbands.
Regression analyses further indicated that child-care task involvements, coparenting support, family value, and fairness value were four factors that significantly predicted marital Enqing. Among them, coparenting supports showed the highest predicting power. In the wife sample, the predicting power of family value on Enqing was larger than that of child-care task involvement.

Yuan and the Development of Premarital Relationships,"Szu-Chia Chang, Yuh-Huey Jou","culture and interpersonal relation, newlywed couple, development of premarital relationship, yuan","This study investigated the role yuan (predestined relationship) plays in the development of premarital relationships. Interviews and graphing procedures were used with 50 newlywed Taiwanese couples to explore the influence of yuan and related concepts on the development of these couples' premarital interactions. The people interviewed in this study mentioned that in addition to its supernatural and passive elements, yuan also has active elements. The majority of people interviewed believed that yuan was most significant at the beginning of the development of their premarital relationship. After the initial acquaintance was made, the feeling of yuan caused the relationship to develop quickly, and produced the effect of a self-fulfilling expectancy. The feeling of yuan after the initial encounter may strengthen commitment to the marital relationship. Even when there were difficulties in the development of the relationships, the couples earnestly worked together to overcome the difficulties and allow their relationship to continue. The feeling of yuan after the first meeting had an important effect on the stability of the premarital relationship.
As a schema for interpreting Chinese interpersonal relationships, the function of yuan included eliciting personal perception and subsequent behavior. It also serves as a tool for reflection. The implications of the concept of yuan on the theories and research findings concerning eastern and western interpersonal relationships are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200406-x-21-85-123-a,21,2004,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Results indicated that professionals who emphasized either Chinese harmony or Western personal growth values tended to support a victim' decision to go back home, and were reluctant to encourage victims to seek divorce.

A framework of multidimensional causal thinking is developed to provide a theoretical perspective explaining why Taiwanese people still have much non-rational behavior in modern society.

Ingroup-outgroup Differentiation: From the Biological to the Human Level,"Mei-Chih Li, Jing-Yi Chuang","Taiwan history, social identity, cognitive representation, categorization of groups","Empirical evidence of differentiation of ”we-ness” and ”other-ness” can be found at the level of the immunity system of the human body and at the ethological level in social animals and human beings. Categorization cues to elicit ingruop vs. outgroup discrimination in the animal kingdom are always sensory-dependent and simple in contrast to the cues used by human beings, which are characterized by multiplicity, complexity, and changeability. Because of human beings' long term and working memory, and social representation and subjective cognition construction abilities, differentiation of ingroup and outgroup members for humans is mainly cognitive and highly dependent on the social context. Categorization cues may retrieve one of many ingroup-outgroup representations built into a person's long term memory through direct or indirect experience with historical intergroup events. In the past four hundred years of Taiwan's history, the important ingroup/outgroup categorization cues have been: (1) Pro- vs. against the Ching dynasty; (2) Dutch sovereign government vs. Chinese Han people; (3) Same vs. different immigration origins from China; (4) Same origin but different village residence in Taiwan; (5) Same residence in Taiwan, but with preferences for different folk operas; (6) Japan sovereign government vs. Chinese Han people; (7) Immigration time to Taiwan; and (8)Taiwanese ideology vs. Chinese ideology. While the basic process of categorization cues-ingroup-outgroup differentiation, ingroup favoritism, and outgroup discrimination-has been well established in de-context studies, social identity theory can be enriched by involving social relevant issues and localized historical contexts.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200312-x-20-3-38-a,20,2003,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Despite choosing different ethnic identities to define themselves, all participants had almost equally high positive evaluations of Taiwan. Their evaluations of China varied with their chosen ethnic identity. Identification as ”Chinese” reduced psychological distance from China, while incorporation of Taiwanese identity increased the distance. It was proposed that nepotism of life space underlies participants' attitudes toward Taiwan, whereas the attitude toward China is based on lineage nepotism and cultural nepotism.

The Role of Group Identification and Prejudice in the Relationship between Taiwan and China,Yao-Chia Chuang,"social identity theory, group identification, Taiwan's Relationship with China, stereotype, prejudice","This study tested whether social identity theory can explain the prejudice of Taiwanese college students towards Chinese people in China (labeled Chinese). In 1998, 538 students from 4 colleges in southern Taiwan responded to a questionnaire that assessed respondents' attitudes towards Chinese and Taiwanese, their group identification, and their attitudes toward issues of Taiwan's unification with China and Taiwan's commercial exchanges with China. Participants held more negative attitudes towards Chinese than they did towards Taiwanese. However, the individual's group identification as either a Taiwanese or a Chinese was found to moderate the degree of prejudice towards the Chinese. Those respondents classifying themselves with a pure Taiwanese identity held the most negative attitudes towards the Chinese. The respondents classifying themselves with a pure Chinese identity tended to hold more favorable, though still negative, attitudes towards the Chinese. The respondents classifying themselves with a double identity of being both Taiwanese and Chinese tended to hold an intermediate attitude towards the Chinese. The study also found: (1) group identification was related to the respondent's attitude as to whether or not Taiwan should unify with China; (2) negative attitudes towards the Chinese may undermine the individual's willingness for Taiwan to conduct economic or cultural exchanges with China; and (3) after controlling for the previous two factors, group-belongingness, which was based on parents' birthplace (in Taiwan or China), was found to have a direct effect on both these attitudes.

Because of its historical connection to both China and Taiwan, Japan is occasionally involved in the complex and polemical problems of ethnic identification of the people of Taiwan. The results of this study indicated that favorable attitudes toward Japan relative to China may be predicted by subjective ethnic identification and Taiwanese ideology. Those people who identify themselves as Taiwanese tend to have a more positive perception of Japan relative to China, and attribute the negative behaviors committed by the Japanese during colonization to more positive causes than those who identify themselves as Chinese. Furthermore, ideology related to the pursuit of Taiwan's independence and political indigenization mediated ethnic identification and favorable attitudes toward Japan.

Defining the Self-other Relation: The Emergence of Composite Self,Luo Lu,"composite self, self contents, self-other relation","The traditional Chinese self is not an independent entity; it dwells in the self-other relation. It is not considered to have traits that are constant across situations, but to manifest according to the nature of the relationship. It is not a guiding force for behavior. Instead, it is to be suppressed and overcome. For traditional Chinese people, the ”self-in-relation” is the core of selfhood. However, with Western influence and the challenges of modernization and social change, contemporary Chinese people have developed a system of ”composite self” that combines the traditional ”self-in-relation” and the Western ”independent and contained self”. The flexible operation of self-other relation is prerequisite to the emergence of this composite self. Analysis of 3 individual interviews and 5 focus group discussions with # Taiwanese participants was used to explore the meanings of abstract concepts such as ”self content” and ”self-other relations, and how the ”self-other boundary” is set in order to understand the emergence of the composite self as a way of expressing both the ”independence” and ”interdependence” needs of contemporary Taiwanese people. Results generally supported the theoretical construct of composite self.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200312-x-20-139-207-a,20,2003,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Triad Model of Paternalistic Leadership: Evidence from Business Organizations in Mainland China,"Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Li-Fang Chou, Min-Ping Huang, Jiing-Lih Farh, Si-Qing Peng","authority orientation of traditionality, paternalistic leadership, subordinate responses","Paternalistic Leadership (PL) has been labeled a prevalent phenomenon in Chinese business organizations, almost all current evidence comes from organizations in the 3 tigers of East Asia and the overseas Chinese societies in South-East Asia, especially from Chinese Family Businesses (CFBs). But paternalistic leadership has been little explored in the business organizations of Mainland China. We sampled 240 leader-subordinate dyads from business organizations in China to probe the prevalence of PL, the generalizability of the triad model, and the influence of 3 leadership styles: shi-en (granting favors), li-wei (inspiring awe or fear) and shuh-der (setting a moral example). Results indicated: (1) according to confirmatory factor analysis, the fitness of the triad model including benevolent, authoritarian, and moral leadership, is good; (2) compared PL with Western transformational leadership, PL had unique explanative power for all the responses and attitudes of subordinates, and transformational leadership also had unique effects on all dependent variables except organizational commitment; (3) moral leadership had the most significant main effect of the 3 elements of PL; (4) for the interaction effects among the 3 elements, leadership utilizing equivalent En and Wei had a positive effect on emic-loyalty, but En - Der and Wei - Der had negative interaction effects on outcome variables; (5) the subordinate' s authority orientation had no moderating effect on authoritarian leadership to subordinate responses.

The Influence of Parents' Theories of Human Nature on Parenting Belief: The Case of Theories of Intelligence,Wen-Ying Lin,"theory of human nature, parenting belief, theory of intelligence, malleability","Two studies examined the proposal that implicit theories of intelligence moderate parenting beliefs and thus influence parenting style. In Study 1, 18 parents were interviewed in depth. The results suggested that parents' belief in the stability of intelligence was associated with an emphasis on the enhancement of children's attitude towards learning rather than the effort to change learning outcome. In Study 2, 1463 parents responded to a questionnaire requiring judgments about the malleability of intelligence and responses to fictitious stories about children's academic performance under various contexts. The results demonstrated that parents' beliefs about the malleability of intelligence may serve an important role in the evaluative processing of children' s academic performance and parents' own motivational processing in parenting.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200312-x-20-253-293-a,20,2003,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Writing about Trauma: Reconstructing the Psychosocial Healing Experiences of the 9-21 Earthquake Survivors in Taiwan,Yaw-Sheng Lin,"trauma, social construction, life world","Psychosocial reactive experiences and coping strategies of survivors of the 9-21 earthquake, the largest in Taiwan's recent history, were explored through participant observation, depth interviews, interpretive interaction, and social construction grounded methodology. Twenty people were interviewed at least once at a disaster site in central Taiwan over a one year period that began one year after the disaster. Reactions included multiple realities, namely, collapsed spatiality, disruptive self, absent body, reorganized temporality, and reconstructed world. These dynamic structures were the manifestations of the interactive, ambivalent, and transformational relationships between the sufferers and their life-world in the post-disaster period. Individual differences in coping strategy approach behind the general structures were also found. These included reason vs. innocence, daily life vs. extreme situation, normality vs. episode, reality vs. illusion, and reconstruction vs. disruption. To recontextualize the traumatic experiences in thick description, a phenomenological view of the intentional arc, which projects a person's past, future, human environment, and physical, ideological and moral situation, was proposed. The intentional arc usually allows for unity of sensibility and motility, but it went limp when the victims suffered from the disaster. Survivors then strove to achieve new life balance between posttraumatic growth and ontological suffering. The psychosocial healing process entailed dwelling in the lived space and reconstructing the post-traumatic subjectivity through the aftermath of suffering.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200306-x-19-3-64-a,19,2003,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

There is a certain tension and a possible loosening between phenomenology and psychology due to Husserl's transcendental phenomenology and Heidegger's fundamental ontology with the implication that the concept transcendent needs to be correctly seized upon. On this basis, ethical issues pertaining to mental health nursing in Taiwan are discussed through examination of three psychiatric nursing and therapy studies relating to spirit possession in psychiatric patients, the emotional expressions of families of the psychiatric patients, and the social constructions of psychiatric patients. The first takes a hermeneutic phenomenological position, but does not make use of phenomenological methods and thus cannot discover the essential cause or the cure for the illness. The second study possesses a phenomenological attitide, but the method is not phenomenological. The final study makes use of qualitative field data and corresponds with the idea of vita active, which Hannah Arendt emphasizes. The article concludes by expanding the content of phenomenology from Husserl, and Heidegger via Hans Jonas to Arendt with variations in methodology and (subject matter).

Multiple techniques including in-depth individual interviews, focus groups, participant observation, and field notes are applied for data collection. Psychiatric patients' unstable life temporality included three themes: 1) an unreal and bewildered sense of internal temporality, 2) a broken daily life time-line and the three dimensions of past, present, and future, and 3) lack of synchronization between self and social pace. Four themes were uncovered with respect to self-adjustment of life temporality: 1) self-closure and refusing to let time move around, 2) differentiation between real and unreal worlds, 3) causality and repositioning of personal sense of time and space, and 4) preserving and maintaining daily life routines. Exploration f the descriptive phenomenon of psychiatric patients' unstable temporality and self-adjustment is aimed at allowing health personnel to further understand and discuss ways to lead, initiate, and reintegrate patients' life temporality.

Organizational Loyalty: Indigenous Construct and Its Measurement,"Ding-Yu Jiang, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, King-Kong Jen, Cheng-Wei Huang","Chinese organizational loyalty, organizational commitment","Organizational loyalty can be described as an employee with a high level of affective attachment and behavioral support to his/her organization. Organizational loyalty is not only important for connecting organization members as a whole, but also a critical issue in organizational behavior research. In Chinese society, there is a long history revolving around the evolution of the concept of loyalty. Before Chun Qiu, the word 'loyalty' in Chinese society implicated one's dedication to one's country. However, the concept of 'loyalty' has slowly evolved into a resemblance of the western concept with the increase of Western influence on Chinese society. Nowadays, loyalty is still important for Chinese employees, and several indigenous researches investigated the content and construct of loyalty in Chinese business enterprises. However, the differences between organizational loyalty in Chinese society and organizational commitment in Western society are still unclear. Furthermore, there are no reliable and validated instruments applicable to measure Chinese organizational loyalty. As a result, this study systematically reviews the findings and definitions in Chinese and Western societies, and uses qualitative approaches gathering organizational loyalty descriptions in order to identify the uniqueness of the construct of Chinese organizational loyalty. According to the literature review and qualitative analysis, the study develops the Chinese organizational loyalty scale. The scale is validated using exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, criteria-related validity analysis, and discriminate validity analysis. The results shows that Chinese organizational loyalty is consisted two cross-culture common dimensions-”internalization obligation” and ”identification to organization”, and six culture-specific dimensions-”dedication for company”, ”constructive suggestion”, ”helping colleague”, ”initiative”, ”protecting company resources”, and ”organizational compliance”.

Expressing or Suppressing Anger: Subordinates' Anger Responses to Supervisors' Authoritarian Behaviors in a Taiwan Enterprise,"Tsung-Yu Wu, Wei-Ling Hsu, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","authoritarianaism, anger supperession, job satisfaction, anger","Authoritarianism is a traditional leadership style based on hierarchical family structure that still exists in modern Chinese business. Past research seldom examined the relationship between supervisors' authoritarianism and subordinates' emotional responses and well-being. This study intends to explore the influence of supervisors' authoritarianism on subordinates' anger responses and job satisfaction.
Authoritarianism consists of four kinds of behaviors: authority and control, underestimation of subordinate competence, image building, and didactic behavior. These behaviors typically evoke anger. We hypothesized that supervisors' authoritarian behaviors would trigger subordinates' anger feeling. Besides, Three different theoretical viewpoints (Chinese authority orientation, social power, and emotional transaction and dramaturgical theory) lead us to contend that when supervisors are authoritarian, subordinates have strong tendency to suppress their anger. Finally, People in Chinese societies treat anger suppression as a normal condition. We hypothesized that the effect of subordinates' anger suppression on job satisfaction would be less profound than the effect of subordinate' real anger feeling on job satisfaction.
Results showed that supervisors' authoritarian behaviors do influence their subordinates' anger feeling, and can predict the subordinates' tendency to suppress anger. Further, supervisors' authoritarian behaviors have a negative effect on subordinates' job satisfaction through feeling of anger, but not through the mediating process of anger suppression. These results suggest that the so-called ”emotional dissonance” phenomenon in Western society may not have the same influence on subordinates' well-being in non-Western societies. Implications, limitations, and directions for future research and application in management are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200212-x-18-3-49-a,18,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Chinese Business Leaders' Employee Categorization and Managerial Behaviors,"Wei-Ling Hsu, Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Min-Ping Huang","guanxi, managerial behaviors, competence, employee categorization, loyally","This study provides empirical evidence for Cheng's employee categorization model and improves the understanding of the dynamics of managerial behaviors in the Chinese context. Using a simulation approach and a 2x2x2 within-subject design, the extent to which the three variables (guanxi, zhongcheng, and competence) affect Chinese leaders' managerial behaviors was examined. Results revealed significant relationships between guanxi, zhongcheng, and competence and several managerial behaviors. In particular, a leader will share more information, provide more opportunities for participation in decision-making, and trust and care more about an employee who is a relative than one who is not related. Similar effects also appear when an employee is highly loyal to the leader or has high competence. Significant two-way interaction effects indicate that guanxi, zhongcheng, and competence interactively affect managerial behavior, and a significant three-way interaction implies that it is possible for leaders to take all these three variables into account simultaneously when categorizing employees. Implications for future research and practice in the Chinese context are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200212-x-18-51-94-a,18,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

It addresses general problem areas in the Western public relations literature, factoring in the implications of social psychology and cultural psychology for organization-public relationships. It also identifies opportunities for interdisciplinary application of the Relationship-orientation theory and provides a discourse between public relations theories and organization network theories. In-depth interviews were used for this qualitative study, which adopts the principles of methodological triangulation for data triangulation, researcher triangulation, theory triangulation, and method triangulation in order to enhance research validity and reliability. The study covers the findings on two types of interviewees: 1) 13 Executive Yuan liaison officers with the Legislative Yuan from April through May 1999, and 2) twenty-two PR practitioners from PR agencies as well as in-house PR practitioners from December 2001 through January 2002. Based upon Yang (1992) and Zao's (2000) theories, this paper further develops the Two-factor Relations-Oriented Model, which includes relation-centered orientation and relational-rationality orientation. This model factors in multifold challenges from professionalism and modernization. Thus, the correlations between and among relation-centered-oriented behaviors, relational-rationality-oriented behaviors, demographics, and organization structure variables, are investigated. The preliminary findings of the results demonstrate significant correlations among these variables.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200212-x-18-95-172-a,18,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Guanxi and Social Network in Chinese Organization,Li-Fang Chou,"guanxi, social network","Social networks have been a critical area of focus for Western social psychologists studying interpersonal interaction and exchange since the 1960s. Due to the gradual maturation of this area and remarkable progress in network analysis methods, some Western researchers have strongly suggested that Organization Behavior (OB) research should adopt network analysis in examining individuals’ behavior and attitudes. Similarly, in the 1980s Chinese researchers began focusing on guanxi (a person’s network of relationships) in the context of Chinese society with the expectation of developing a comprehensive understanding of interpersonal interaction within Chinese organizations. Unfortunately, these studies either focused tightly on the concept of guanxi while ignoring the application of social network theorv and concepts, or they simply imported the concepts of social network theory into Chinese organizations without specifying the unique contents of guanxi. To make up for this inadequacy, this paper starts with a discussion of concepts and connotations related to social networks and guanxi, and then makes a comparison to clarify their similarities ad unique points. This analysis is applied to significant OB issues, such as leadership and power, working attitudes, resignation and absence, performance, and job satisfaction, with the goal of applying social network theory to these issues and indicating possible starting points for study on the relationship between guanxi and OB. Finally, the role of guanxi in the context of Chinese society and possible directions for theory construction are proposed and discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200212-x-18-175-227-a,18,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Exploring the Implicit Structure of Leader Behavior in Chinese Cultural Context,Chao-Ming Liu,"moral evaluation, leader behavior, implicit leadership theory, categorization process, dual-categorization","Leader behavior studies have provided consistent results in the past decades. It seems that onsideration and initiating structure are two major dimensions of leader behaviors. Implicit leadership theories, however, argued that the two leader behavior dimensions are just a reflection of subordinates' implicit categorization, not the real behaviors presented by leaders. In both Mainland China and Taiwan, moral and character factors always emerged from leader behavior studies. Using a bottom-up inquiry approach, the present study developed a leader behavior inventory based on critical incident data collected in earlier studies. The inventory was administered to 750 employees. Results indicated that two factors, positive and negative leader behaviors, consistently emerged in different factor analysis procedures. Cluster analysis revealed that subjects could be properly divided into two clusters based on their responses in the leader behavior inventory. One cluster of subjects intended to evaluate their leaders positively, another one was just the opposite. The author tries to explain the results with cultural perspectives. In Chinese culture, dual- categorization (like yin/yang, good/evil) is often used in any situations. The most popular character sketch is Chun-tzu (i.e., real gentleman) and Hsiao-jen (i.e., mean person) presented in the Confucian Analects. Based on the implicit leadership theory, it is possible that subjects' responses on the leader behavior inventory just reflect their implicit categorization leader behaviors. Taking earlier related findings as evidence, the author proposes that moral evaluation is a key component in Chinese leader behavior. The cultural context is really important in indigenous leader behavior research.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200212-x-18-229-265-a,18,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The Reason and Myth of Education Fanaticism: A Historical Review,Jenn-Wu Wang,"education reform, scholar-official-envy, education fanaticism","Traditionally, people who showed overenthusiasm in pursuing higher education were thought to have scholar-official envy, considered irrational, and given the label education fanatic. Overemphasis on education is still common in modern Chinese societies. The cultural origins of this attitude are explored in this study to clarify the contributing factors and practical significance through content analysis of historical materials. Scholar-official envy existed in the Sung, Ming, and Ching Dynasties and brought about the corruption of intellectuals and schools because intellectuals studied in pursuit of fame and wealth, not for truth and morality. In modern times, scholar-official envy can be equated with social class consciousness and obsession with the corresponding practical benefits for intellectuals.
Western scholars explain the phenomenon by pointing out the significance of the diploma. This perspective completely matches the situation in modern Taiwan where the diploma plays an important role in influencing a person's career and life. Together with the above historical review, it may be safely concluded that education fanaticism may possibly reflect human nature rather than culture. And, diplomaism may be a rational rather than an irrational choice, better understood as a social phenomenon than as a cultural heritage.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200206-x-17-3-65-a,17,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Intensive life-history interviews were conducted with 20 college graduates from various fields of study at 7 universities. Within-case and cross-case narrative summary was applied to analyze the interview data. The results show that the career construction process can be characterized as a dynamic interaction between self and others. Personal interests and characteristics as well as social values and others' expectations constitute the foundations for constructing career goals and making important career decisions. Three groups exist among college students based on their orientation toward self and others: (l) other-oriented, (2) self-oriented, and (3) in-between. These 3 groups construct their careers differently in (1) forming early career aspirations in childhood, (2) transforming career aspirations in secondary school, (3) choosing college majors and constructing college experiences, (4) making career plans after graduation, and (5) conceiving images for future life. The experiences of the in-between group can be further differentiated into 4 patterns: (l) balance between self and others, (2) adaptation of self to others, (3) conflict between self and others, and (4) incorporation of others into self.

Reconstructing the Chinese Control Belief from the Heaven-Person-Analogy: An Action Theory Perspective,Shih-Hsien Kuo,"action theory, control belief, adaptation, heaven-person-analogy","Since the 1960s the locus of control theory has been discussed worldwide. This theory highlights belief in an internal-external distinction of control. In the 80s the primary-secondary control theory provided further theoretical consideration of the process of psychological control. The Western theoretical perspective of control is based on the Cartesian subject-object dichotomy allowing independent interaction between the person and the world. Western theories of control beliefs refer either to the world (internal or primary control) or to the person (external or secondary control).
In traditional Chinese cosmology, the subject is seen as an inseparable part of nature, which is composed of three concepts: Heaven, Earth, and Person. The interaction between these three groups is understood to be interrelated with analogical effects. Chinese control beliefs are adaptation-oriented, and they are directed both to the subject at the action level and to the world intentionally. People try to change themselves in order to change the world.
Traditional fortune-telling and Feng-Shui beliefs in Taiwan are discussed in this paper as examples that reveal the analogical interrelation between heavenly timing, spatial adequacy, and personal life events. Under such analogical thinking, personal action is seen as one of the necessary conditions of a life event.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200206-x-17-269-307-a,17,2002,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Zijiren: The Relationship between Mother- and Daughter-in-law as Seen from a Classificatory Scheme of Chinese Interpersonal Affection,Yi-Yin Yang,"genuine affection, mother- and daughter-in-law relationship, obligatory affection, zijiren/wairen, affection pattern","The zijiren (one of us, insider)/wairen (outsider) classification denotes the psychological distinction Chinese speakers use to distinguish ”us” from ”them”. Chinese speakers have two major dimensions for classifying different kinds of guanxi (relationship): (1) the ascribed dimension, which is a social institutional arrangement based on kinship and manifest in obligatory affection; and (2) the achieved dimension, which is based on interpersonal interaction and manifest in genuine affection.
Relationships between family members in traditional Chinese society were based on close kinship as well as frequent transactions throughout a person's entire life. They developed and were strengthened through the continuous intricate fusion of obligatory and genuine affection. The parent-daughter relationship would change once the daughter got married. The daughter's ascribed obligation to provide for her parents' basic needs and burial would transfer from her parents to her parents-in-law. The genuine affection a daughter had for her parents became separated from her obligatory affection, and the obligatory affection a daughter-in-law possessed for her parents-in-law was detached from her true affection formed through interpersonal interaction.
This detached interpersonal relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law is the focus of this study. This study examines the claim that Chinese affection patterns are based on the zijiren/wairen distinction, not on the distinction between family members and non-family members. Results show that a very detached type of affection comes into existence when the association between the ascribed and achieved relationship is broken or changed to a substantial degree.

Mother- and daughter-in-law who take each other into their own circle and treat each other as an in-group member tend to have good relationships. In contrast, mother- and daughter-in-law who treat one another as outsiders have distant relationships.

A Qualitative Study of Newlyweds' Marital Adjustment Processes,Szu-Chia Chang,"qualitative study, newlywed, marital adjustment process","Marital adjustment has been a major topic of research for many years, yet researchers have not achieved consensus on how to conceptualize and study it. Two major limitations exist in previous marital adjustment research: lack of a theoretical framework and the focus on adjustment as an end rather than a process. The purpose of this study is to develop a conceptualization of marital adjustment as a process. Through in-depth interviews with twenty Taiwanese newlywed couples, a preliminary model explaining the marital adjustment process is established, with the final goal of enhancing understanding and developing an indigenous theory of Chinese marital relationships.
Qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews were analyzed using the grounded theory approach. Results show that areas in which marital adjustments were called for could be classified as adjustment between the couple and their families of origin, adjustment between spouses, and adjustment between family and work. The model of marital adjustment generated by this study suggests that there are different pathways through which marital partners adjust to each other. Adjustment takes place either as a mutual influencing process through which both partners alter their attitudes or behavior, as an accommodation process in which one partner controls the relationship, or through a process of constant quarrelling and bickering. Finally, gender differences were found in the strategies that husbands and wives use in dealing with adjustment problems.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200112-x-16-91-133-a,16,2001,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Psychosomatic Disorder: The Straying of a Woman's Self within the Patriarchal Structure,Li-Li Huang,"psychosomatic disorder, domestic violence, feminist social constructionist approach, extramarital affair, affectional independence, functional independence, gender self","This study focuses on the analysis of cultural factors involved in female psychopothology in the Chinese paternalistic structure in attempt to explain women's higher rate of psychosomatic disorder. The socialization process which forms the social expectations, habits, and norms that together create a cooperative system for the formation of female psychopathology is explored. These social constructions are so prevalent that a Chinese woman under their sway have no way to escape, and so may fall into a psychosomatic disorder, even to the extent of paranoid disorder.
This study is based on the case of a married middle-aged woman who requested psychological treatment. Using the data of 20 hours of narrative, and adopting the constructive approach to the cultural self arid the feminist social constructionist approach, the pathological process for the case was analyzed. As a well-educated woman who had developed the functional independence during her teenage years, the case lacked the affective independence due to her protective patriarchal social education. After entering a paternalistic-oriented dominant married life, she faced conflict with the male-centered beliefs of shiao dao (filial piety) and sexuality and with a strong-arm approach for power display. Due to her persistence with traditional concepts of loyalty and chastity as well as the modern, equalitarian concept of family, she constantly experienced the entanglement type of conflict with her husband to the extent that she gradually lost her energy and almost collapsed into paranoid disorder. In addition to providing an interpretation of the dialectic between the self and the paternalistic culture that led to the disorder, this study suggests some feasible methods for women's empowerment and self-development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200106-x-15-3-62-a,15,2001,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
Understanding of Family Violence through the Chinese Concepts of Face and Yi,Ko-Ling Chan,"gender role, Chinese family violence, face","Despite the rising rate of spousal abuse in Chinese societies like Hong Kong, there is a dearth of local studies on the topic. Previous studies have not adequately addressed the cultural specificity of risk factors, tending to generalize factors across cultures. The few culturally specific studies focused on only a few factors such as patriarchal social structure, male domination, and power and control. Resulting treatment programs for male batterers have been mainly educational, emphasizing gender equality. However, male batterers do not respond well to an educational or confrontational approach. The drop-out rate is high, and the effectiveness of these types of treatment programs has not been confirmed.
The purpose of this study is to identify Chinese cultural factors that are embedded in Chinese men's violence against their intimate partners, and understand how men construct their violence experiences. Twenty-six Chinese male batterers participated in this study. Based on the findings, an indigenous model of masculinity and men's violence against their female partners was developed. The Chinese cultural concepts of yi and face are associated with men's violence against their female partners. More rigid definitions of masculinity in yi and face, and greater challenges to a man's masculinity, result in greater impairment of self differentiation, lower capacity for conflict resolution, and higher likelihood of spousal violence. Implications for the development of indigenous treatment programs and policy making are discussed.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200106-x-15-63-111-a,15,2001,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Preliminary Study of Marital Violence and Social Work Intervention in Urban Aboriginal Communities,"Shu-Ling Hwang, Fang-Hao Lin, Pei-Ling Wu","the Amis, marital violence, feminist consciousness-raising group, urban aborigines","This study explores the problems of marital violence in urban aboriginal communities relying on data collected from in-depth interviews, questionnaires, and personal observations. Female victims' reactions to violence and evaluation of the viability of casework and of the effectiveness of a consciousness-raising group based on feminist self-empowerment guidelines are also provided, and a community service model regarding aboriginal marital violence problems is proposed. Aboriginal marital violence (frequency of occurrence and type of violence) and its surrounding myths in the subject community were found to be much the same as in the Han society. However, the community's specific social interactions and its encounter with prejudice as a minority in the mainstream society profoundly shape the nature of a victim's reaction to violence and the help-seeking process and needs. In a tightly-knit community, marital violence is a no-tell, can't-tell, keep-to-oneself problem. Because of experiences with deep-rooted racial discrimination, aboriginal communities are concerned that marital violence could become another negative label-like alcoholism, child prostitution, and unemployment for the mainstream society to attach to aborigines. Under such pressure, victims of violence fear that to seek help from institutions would bring shame to the aboriginal community. Moreover, they are unwilling to ask for assistance from police or social welfare institutions both because they are not accustomed to the formalities of institutional process, and because they are discouraged by the indifference of police and social workers who use their preconceptions to explain away aboriginal marital violence problems. We suggest that when handling marital violence problems in urban communities or tribal settlements, social workers should follow a communal model, the key to which is first to understand thoroughly the aboriginal socio-cultural system and the community-specific cultural features, and then to create a fitting model for intervention. Feminist empowerment consultations and consciousness-raising groups are in principle suitable for aboriginal women, but in practice must be modified to relate to the character of the particular aboriginal community.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200106-x-15-113-159-a,15,2001,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The process was videotaped and analyzed through ethnographic microanalysis by a research team including the authors, a family therapist, and a judge. Results revealed six stages of dynamic interaction in the change process: 1) The parents sought help for the patient because of her symptoms; 2) symptoms improved, but conflicts occurred between the patient and her parents; 3) symptoms recurred and conflict over division of labor occurred between the patient's parents; 4) symptoms improved and family interaction stabilized; 5) symptoms recurred and the therapists challenged the parents to change their conflict over division of labor; 6) symptoms improved, and the alliance between the patient and her parents changed, but the basic interactive pattern between the parents remained the same. Two additional key observations were made. First, the functional significance of the symptoms to family structure and the recur/improve change cycle of symptoms with respect to the family were identified. Second, the difficulty in changing the structure of the division of labor between the couple could not be eliminated. The difficulty in resolving that structure may be closely related to existing culture, and may be a result of socio-cultural influences on family interactions.

After encountering chronic illness or disaster, subjects perceived temporality in terms of incomprehensible past, altered present, and expected future. Subjects found that life continued to be meaningful and made psychological growth by understanding their post disaster lives in terms of the constructs survivorhood vs. victimhood, appreciate others vs. blame others, and life world reconstruction vs. life world disruption. Time itself cannot heal post-traumatic experiences. Only when sufferers recognize and transform their deep interpretations of their life disruption events through the medium of memory testimony and imagination displacement, can they reconnect their life worlds and rebuild their identity.

Xin Xue: The Development of a Psychology of the Chinese Self,Der-Heuy Yee,"developmental psychology, self, xin xue studies of psyche","This paper clarifies the relationship between Chinese studies of psyche, called xin xue, and the psychology of self. Xin xue is not a modern psychology, but is also not a Chinese philosophical psychology. It is a psychological discourse of Self (as a subject) developed among Chinese intellectuals that conceptualizes the Self as autonomous and includes basic theories and everyday knowledge. Xin xue has a long history in China. Xin xue classes (huai tang) were established almost eight hundred years ago. Xin xue inherited the traditional terminology of Taoism and Confucianism and focuses on the interior world of the individual psyche. From this focus, it has continued to develop on the basis of the concept of entirely exhausting the energy of a person's heart and nature. In line with this tradition, the characteristics of the Taiwanese indigenous psychology of Self maintain and cultivate the ontological Self, which contains theories of origin and teleology-two systems of the psyche and ethics, which are based on discipline-oriented order towards independence and autonomy of self. If compared to western ego psychology, the ethics and transcendent nature of xin xue would be integrated into Chinese indigenous psychology and help boost its development.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200106-x-15-271-303-a,15,2001,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Using this definition, a triad model of paternalistic leadership was theoretically built and traced to Chinese cultural origins. However, up to the present, there is no quantitative empirical research in this domain. This study was designed to complement this defect. According to the three constituent elements of paternalistic leadership (PL), namely, authoritarianism, benevolence, and morality, we constructed the Paternalistic Leadership Scale (PLS) and employed confirmatory factor analysis to examine its factorial composition. Within the samples from business organizations and education institutions in Taiwan, this scale was shown to have adequate internal consistency and clear factorial structure. Moreover, the PLS correlated with several related measures in a predictable manner.

Supervisory Loyalty in Chinese Business Enterprises: The Relative Effects of Emic and Imposed-etic Constructs on Employee Effectiveness,"Bor-Shiuan Cheng, Ding-Yu Jiang","sacrifice and dedication, Supervisory loyalty, internalization and identification, initiative supportiveness, obedience and compliance, task assistance","Supervisory Loyalty (loyalty to supervisors) has a significant influence on employee effectiveness in business settings. Western researchers conceptualize supervisory loyalty (imposed-etic SL) as a subordinate's identification with and internalization of supervisors' values or behaviors. In Chinese business settings, four additional dimensions are included in the concept to form emic supervisory loyalty (emic SL): sacrifice and dedication, task assistance, obedience and compliance, and initiative supportiveness. The purpose of this article is to examine the relationship among emic SL, imposed-etic SL, and employee effectiveness. Two studies were conducted. In Study 1, 660 employees of a Taiwanese semiconductor testing company were surveyed. Results indicated that, except for turnover intention, the emic SL variables significantly increased the ability to predict self-rating in-role job performance, attendance, and job satisfaction after controlling for the effect of etic SL variable. In Study 2, we surveyed 538 employees from 59 Taiwanese companies, and obtained the following results supporting Study 1: (a) After controlling for the effect of the imposed-etic SL variable, dimensions of emic SL significantly increased the ability to predict employee turnover intention, self-rating in-role job performance, and emic organizational citizenship behavior (OCB); (b) emic SL variables had no significant effect on predicting imposed-etic OCB; (c) among the dimensions of emic SL, task assistance and initiative supportiveness had significantly positive effects on predicting self-rating in-role job performance. However, task assistance had a significant negative effect on predicting turnover intention. In contrast to the other three variables, sacrifice and dedication had a positive effect on predicting turnover intention, but a negative effect on predicting emic OGB. Implications and research directions are noted for future inquiry into supervisory loyalty.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200012-x-14-65-113-a,14,2000,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

Now that Taiwan has moved beyond the labor-intensive industries of the four small dragons era and successfully built a knowledge-intensive information and electronics industry, do traditional Chinese values still have a significant role to play? This study surveyed 322 R&D personnel from 26 firms and 3 nonprofit research institutes in the information and electronics industry in Taiwan. Results supported the post-Confucian hypothesis and showed that traditional Chinese values lead to positive organizational behaviors. Traditional values include positive aggression, inhibition, sophistication, and authoritarianism. Only authoritarianism carries no effectiveness in R&D tasks. Stronger attachment to traditional values is associated with more job satisfaction, greater organizational commitment, and better performance (particularly accountability). Although the authoritarian structure in Taiwan is eroding, traditional values still have a significant role in the high tech industry. There were two additional heuristic findings. Both in the rational organization and in the loose organization, traditional values result in positive organizational behaviors, and are significantly instrumental in private firms.

The existential facet refers to the primary moments of face-to-face encounter between oneself and Other. This first facet is always eclipsed by the practical facet of ethics, which highlights necessary situational actions. The social facet is composed of normative ideas and dogmas, and usually emerges as dominant over the other two. In this treatise I first discuss the inception of ethics and contrast divinization, which is mostly found in western religious traditions, and self-cultivation, which is presented mostly in Chinese Confucian schools, as two modes of the subsequent development of ethics. Second, I review three psychological studies on parent-child relationships, prostitution, and hospice care to demonstrate the interaction of the three facets in human experience.

Change in Harmony in Psychological Counseling,"Grace Cheung, Cecilia Chan","I Ching, Satir Model, Indigenous counseling","In modern Hong Kong, the influence of traditional Chinese culture remains strong. Authoritarian collectivism continues to pervade many local families, where people are constrained to sacrifice their small self for the big self respect harmony and the hierarchical order, and practice filial piety and self-restraint. This pattern of behavior differs markedly from the egalitarian individualist cultures of the West, where people are socialized to value individual freedom, equality, differences and self-actualization, as well as direct expression of self and confidence to face conflicts, and where the therapeutic models we learned emerged.
For most of these therapeutic models originating from the West, change occupies a very important position. If there is need to choose between change, which means facing conflict, and harmony, which means keeping the status quo, the choice is often change. From our experience, uncritical application of this strategy with local clients leads to suspicion, resistance, and finally rejection of the counseling process as well as the counselor.
Harmony is a focal concern in Chinese community living. It occupies a central position in the I Ching, which captures the essence of Chinese philosophical thought. For the authors of the I Ching, ”harmony reflects the nature of heaven and earth”; ”harmony is good, disharmony is evil.”
The fundamental concept of the I Ching is change. ”I” means change. The I Ching deals with the Tao (the Way) of change. For more than three thousand years, Chinese have lived within a culture dominated by hierarchical collectivist values, and many among them looked and continue to look to the I Ching for guidance to change without breaking harmony.
Over the past year, we have employed certain concepts of the I Ching in facilitating local clients in the process of change, especially those clients who are deeply influenced by traditional Chinese culture. Results have been encouraging. This paper is an attempt to integrate some of these experiences in clinical practice with theoretical explorations, and to compare certain basic concepts of the I Ching with those of the Satir model, in the hope that it will stimulate further discussion on the development of indigenous counseling.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200012-x-14-199-235-a,14,2000,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies

The Sociocultural and Psychodynamic Processes Involved in Rape Behavior: Ⅰ. Theoretical Analysis,Jiun-Yih Huang,"social-cultural factor, rape behavior, behavioral factor, psychological factor, situational factor","The crime of rape has been of great concern to the public in recent years, but there has been little theoretical and empirical analysis of this crime. In this article I construct an indigenously oriented theoretical framework of the psychodynamics of rape from four perspectives: sociocultural, paychological, situational, and behavioral. The sociocultural perspective identifies the Chinese social and cultural factors that facilitate rape behavior. The psychological perspective indicates that the individual's cognition, emotion, motivation, intention, experience, and personality will all have an influence on the formation of rape. Generally speaking, there are three major kinds of relevant motivation: compensation, retaliation, and sensation-seeking. The situational perspective suggests that offenders take safety, secrecy, and the risk of the situation into account to decide whether action is taken. The behavioral perspective claims that the action of rape is determined by the individual's intention, personality, and situation, and their interaction. The final formation of a Chinese male's rape behavior is due to the combination and interaction of factors from all the four perspectives.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200006-x-13-3-52-a,13,2000,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
The Sociocultural and Psychodynamic Processes Involved in Rape Behavior: Ⅱ. Empirical Testing,Jiun-Yih Huang,"projective questionnaire-survey method, questionnaire-survey, empirical testing, self-defense tendency","Two empirical studies were conducted to test the four-perspective theoretical framework of the formative factors and processes of Chinese rape behavior, as developed in the preceding paper. The first study used the questionnaire-survey method, and the second adopted the projective questionnaire-survey method, and the second adopted the projective questionnaire-survey method. Results of the first study generally supported the the theoretical framework both directly and indirectly. Many subjects showed a strong self-defense tendency in their responses. Subjects were therefore first divided into low and high self-defense tendency groups, and then reanalyzed the data for the two groups. Results indicated that the found relationships between factors stated in the theory were not due to subjects' self-defense tendency. As in the first study, results of the second study also generally supported the theoretical framework both directly and indirectly. In this case, however, the subjects' self-defense tendency was much decreased. The probable reasons for this decrease were that the use of the projective questionnaires lowered the subjects' self-defense, and that the mixture of rapists and non-rapists in the testing condition lowered the situational pressure for the rapists. Directions for future study are finally suggested, including investigation of relevant problems in the family, rapists' experiences with women, social expectations for men, interaction of cognition, affect and sexual arousal, and adoption of experimental methods.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200006-x-13-53-124-a,13,2000,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
A Cultural Analysis of Paternalistic Leadership in Chinese Organization,"Jiing-Lih Farh, Bor-Shiuan Cheng","Authoritarian leadership, paternalistic leadership, benevolent leadership, moral leadership","Paternalistic leadership, which combines strong discipline and authority with fatherly benevolence and moral integrity couched in a 'personalistic' atmosphere, has been found to be prevalent in overseas Chinese family businesses. After critically reviewing the extant literature, we identify three constituent elements of paternalistic leadership (PL): authoritarianism, benevolence, and moral leadership. Authoritarian leadership refers to leader behaviors that assert absolute authority and control over subordinates and demand unquestionable obedience from subordinates. Benevolent leadership refers to leader behaviors that demonstrate individualized, holistic concerns for subordinates' personal or family well-being. Moral leadership may be depicted as leader behaviors that demonstrate superior personal virtues or qualities that provide legitimacy as well as arouse identification and respect from subordinates for the leader. We trace the deep cultural roots of PL and find that Confucianism, Legalism, China's long tradition of imperial rule, rule of man, and norm of reciprocity are key cultural forces that shape PL in Chinese family businesses. We provide preliminary survey data to show how Chinese employees from Hong Kong, the PRC, and Taiwan view authoritarianism and benevolence exhibited by their leaders. We explore the relevance of PL to organizations in contemporary Chinese societies.

"The Influences of Provincial Origin, Party Affiliation, and Political Ideology on Chinese vs. Taiwanese Identity in Taiwan","Hang-Hsin Kao, Mei-Chih Li","social identity theory, ingroup favoritism, ideology, ethnic identity","This paper adopts social identity theory to address the question of how and why people living in Taiwan consider himself or herself as Chinese or Taiwanese. The developmental process of Taiwanese ideology is made explicit through analysis of the immigration history and intergroup political conflict in Taiwan. Two empirical studies were then conducted. In the first study, respondents filled out measures of ethnic identity, political party support, political ideology, traditional Chinese values, and explicit attitude towards Chinese culture. A comparison was made of respondents supporting the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) and the KMT (Kuomintang). Results imply that a new abstract categorization of ethnic identity (”Taiwanese are Taiwanese” and ”Taiwanese are Chinese”) based on political ideology will substitute for the traditional categorization of ethnic identity based on the time period in which a person or his ancestors came to Taiwan from mainland China. When adding the classification category of mother tongue (Taiwanese or Mandarin), we found that DPP supporters whose mother tongue is Taiwanese strongly agreed that ”Taiwanese are Taiwanese”, and KMT supporters whose mother tongue is Mandarin clearly agreed that ”Taiwanese are Chinese”, but DPP supporters with Taiwanese as their mother tongue had more ambiguous ethnic identities. This result implies an adding/subtracting effect of mother tongue that roughly corresponds to the traditional categorization of ethnic identity.
In the second study, a speaker was designated as either a KMT or DPP member. Subjects were asked to evaluate the quality of the speaker's communication as an index of ingroup favoritism. More ingroup favoritism was shown in those subjects with DPP political ideology than those with KMT political ideology.",https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/Index?DocID=10298282-200006-x-13-231-276-a,13,2000,Indigenous Psychological Research in Chinese Societies
"One of Us (zijiren, 自己人): A Case Study on the Classification of Chinese Relationships",Yi-Yin Yang,"one of us/not one of us, insider/outsider, ascribed guanxi/interaction guanxi, zijiren/wairen","Case studies of urban and rural Mainland Chinese were used to determine classifications of guanxi (social relations) in the Chinese cultural and social context. Analysis revealed that when Chinese distinguish Us from Them, they use a psychological classification schema that contains two main dimensions: ascribed and interactive. The contrast defining these two dimensions of guanxi is zijiren/wairen (one of us/not one of us, or insider/outsider).
Differences were found between urban and rural respondents due to the discrepancy in social mobility. With lower social mobility, rural respondents reported a strong bond of kinship identity and the feeling of closeness, interpersonal trust, and responsibility for one another. The kinship system played a key role in judging interpersonal distance. The distinction between family members and strangers became symbolic of the insider/outsider dimension. Intimate relationships were equated with kinship. For urban respondents, the kinship system was only a foundation upon which interpersonal relationships were developed. The feeling of closeness, interpersonal trust, and responsibility for one another mainly focused on interpersonal attraction, inducing a variant of the insider/outsider distinction: bosom buddy/not bosom buddy.
Three theories of guanxi categorization were discussed. The family member/not family member schema and the insider/outsider schema were formed under conditions where the ascription and interaction dimensions could not be sufficiently differentiated.
